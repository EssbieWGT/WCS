China continues to be the world’s biggest EV market, but sales growth cooled to 6% in August compared to a year earlier, when the Chinese sales surged with the introduction of the trade-in scheme.

Total global EV sales in August reached 1.7 million units, including 1.16 million Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 570,000 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), according to Rho Motion’s data.

Sales in the United States accelerated to reach a monthly record in August, due to the upcoming expiry of the tax credits in September, Rho Motion Data Manager, Charles Lester, said.

Emissions legislation continues to underpin sales in the top European markets Germany and the UK, while China’s growth slowed compared to high sales numbers a year ago at the start of the Chinese trade-in scheme.

“Y-o-y growth in the Chinese market slowed in July-August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,” Lester said.

Year to date, global EV sales rose by 25%, with Chinese growth also at 25% and Europe’s sales increase at 31%.

North American EV sales rose by 6% between January and August, but there is high uncertainty from the fourth quarter onwards, in view of the end of the tax credits.

The rush to take advantage of the tax credits pushed the U.S. electric vehicle market to its highest-ever monthly sales in August, with over 175,000 units sold, Rho Motion’s EV & Battery Database showed earlier this week.

Under the OBBBA, the 30D purchase credit and the 45W leasing credit – both worth up to $7,500 on eligible EVs – will end.

“There’s high uncertainty of how big the EV sales drop off will be in Q4,” said Will Roberts, Automotive Research Lead at Rho Motion.

Automakers are already adjusting to this expected dip. VW has announced plans to scale back ID.4 production in the U.S. from October, while GM will cut output at several EV facilities, Rho Motion noted.

Noble Plastics, a woman-owned small business specializing in custom plastic injection molding, announced it is investing $8.5 million to expand the company’s St. Landry Parish headquarters, boosting production capacity to supply First Solar Inc.’s new $1.1 billion manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish. The company is expected to create 29 direct new jobs, while retaining 56 current positions. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 52 indirect new jobs, for a total of 81 potential new jobs in the Acadiana Region. “Noble Plastics’ expansion shows what’s possible when innovative Louisiana companies connect with leading American manufacturers like First Solar,” Gov. Jeff Landry said. “This project means more jobs, more opportunity and more investment right here in Acadiana. My administration is committed to supporting homegrown businesses that are building a stronger, more robust economy for our people.” The expansion project will add new manufacturing capabilities, warehousing and office space to Noble’s existing facility, enhancing its state-of-the-art lineup of robot-operated injection molding machines, in-line inspection and AI-powered monitoring systems. “From Louisiana Growth Network programs to expansion projects fueled by partnerships with new companies coming to our state, Noble Plastics exemplifies LED’s mission in action,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Through our enhanced focus on supporting existing Louisiana businesses and sharing small business success stories, we look forward to working with Noble Plastics and others like it to create opportunities and grow prosperity in every corner of our state.” As part of its domestic sourcing strategy, First Solar chose Noble Plastics to produce precision-molded components for the connection and energy transfer systems in its solar panels. Products made at Noble Plastics’s facility at 318 Burleigh Lane in Grand Coteau will then be shipped to First Solar’s site about 30 miles away in New Iberia.

A facility expansion will add manufacturing capabilities to supply components to First Solar’s new factory in Iberia Parish.

The company is expected to create 29 new direct jobs and retain 56 existing positions.

Construction is expected to begin this fall and be completed by the end of 2026.

“We’re thrilled with the opportunities to grow our team, our location, and support a more diverse range of clients right here in St. Landry Parish,” Noble Plastics President Missy Rogers said. “Our products enhance systems for the Department of Defense, the energy sector, and industrial machinery industries both within and outside of Louisiana. This expansion extends our impact well beyond payroll and vendor spend — our participation with local schools, mentoring and scholarships will grow as well.”

In September 2023, First Solar, the largest solar manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere, announced it would invest more than $1 billion in its fifth U.S. manufacturing facility at the Acadiana Regional Airport. Scheduled to begin operations later this summer, the plant will produce the company’s uniquely American solar technology, and when fully ramped, is expected to create more than 800 direct jobs with an annual payroll exceeding $75 million.

“Noble Plastics brings the kind of technical precision, flexibility, and partnership we look for in our supply chain,” First Solar Chief Supply Chain Officer Mike Koralewski said. “Their proximity to our Louisiana facility, combined with their deep expertise in plastic molding, makes them a valuable contributor to our U.S. manufacturing ecosystem.”

Noble Plastics was founded in 2000 and has grown steadily to become a business leader in the Acadiana community while establishing a long history of involvement with LED Growth Network programs. The company is a graduate of the CEO Roundtables Program, the System for Integrated Growth strategic research program, and the American Academy of Entrepreneurs mentorship program. It also participated in the Louisiana Workforce Commission’s Small Business Employee Training program.

“Noble Plastics’ expansion is a strong example of how local innovation and industry partnerships can drive meaningful growth for St. Landry Parish,” St. Landry Parish President Jessie Bellard said. “This investment not only supports job creation but also strengthens our region’s role in the future of clean energy manufacturing. We’re proud to have Noble Plastics growing right here in our community.”

Noble anticipates starting construction in the third quarter of 2025 and completing the project at the end of 2026.

“St. Landry Economic Development has had the privilege of playing a part in supporting Noble’s growth journey through the years to multiple locations in St. Landry Parish,” SLED CEO Bill Rodier said. “This expansion highlights yet another exciting chapter in their story. Noble is an exceptional community partner with progressive and dynamic leadership, so there are likely additional chapters to be written. We look forward to helping facilitate their continuing growth in the area for many years to come. “

To win the project in Grand Coteau, LED offered Noble Plastics a competitive incentives package that includes a $250,000 reimbursable grant from the Economic Development Award Program for infrastructure and equipment, subject to approval by the Louisiana Economic Development Corporation board. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and High Impact Jobs programs.

“One Acadiana is proud to see Noble Plastics’ expansion, which not only demonstrates their long-standing commitment to our region but also reinforces the positive economic impact of First Solar’s investment,” One Acadiana President and CEO Troy Wayman said. “Noble Plastics' growth to support First Solar highlights the importance of a strong economic ecosystem and serves as a testament to the innovation happening in Acadiana.”","https://www.theadvertiser.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/11/PLAL/86094891007-np.jpg?crop=595,334,x600,y0&width=595&height=334&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-12 07:59:52.981254

Corporate silence on climate policy puts profits and people at risk

The US Environmental Protection Agency recently announced a proposal to end the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Known as the “endangerment finding” and often cited as the legal bedrock for addressing global warming, officials are reconsidering the basic premise that carbon and methane pollution threatens public health.

By seeking to overturn the only rule that allows for the limiting of planet-warming GHG emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas wells under the Clean Air Act, it would end the EPA’s ability to fight and mitigate climate change.

This latest move reminds us that the climate crisis is ultimately a political crisis. The oil and gas lobby, via the Donald Trump administration 2.0, continues to dominate US politics and would have us ignore science and our senses all in the service of maximising profit, while destroying clean air, public health and the environment in the process.

It also follows a long string of anti-climate efforts by the government to cut federal climate science research, repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy provisions, withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and repeal dozens of regulations that aim to keep America’s water and air pollution at bay.

However, the proposed endangerment finding repeal moves beyond predictable regulatory rollbacks and attacks the scientific foundation for climate action.

It is also a deliberate blow to the moral and legal bedrocks of the environmental protection the EPA is tasked with upholding. After all, the EPA’s mission is to protect human health and the environment.

This strategy . . . underscores the administration’s willingness to manipulate our collective understanding of reality

While the government and the polluting oil majors may want us to believe that climate change and the associated pollution pose no threat to public health or the environment, the persistent realities of air pollution and increasingly common extreme weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires and floods persist.

For anyone who has read George Orwell’s 1984, the new administration’s climate denialist moves might remind you of this quote: “The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.”

This strategy to discredit and undermine climate science and climate action underscores the administration’s willingness to manipulate our collective understanding of reality in service of a broader political and economic agenda that sides with polluters over people.

It is up to us to come to our (literal) senses, wake up and recognise that EPA administrator Lee Zeldin’s chaotic plans make climate denial official US policy.

At risk are even further accelerated climate destabilisation and the health and safety of millions of Americans.

Corporate silence

For more than 15 years, the endangerment finding has limited planet-warming GHG emissions from the oil and gas, power and transportation sectors. Many companies moved to invest in clean tech and emissions reduction strategies, especially given the private sector’s understanding of the inherent material risks of climate change to business.

According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Business Breakthrough Barometer report, 61 per cent of company leaders predict that increased costs from climate-related disruptions will impact their business, and nine out of 10 companies say they will maintain or increase their transition-related investments and emissions targets.

Businesses know climate change is not going away, despite what American politicians suggest.

Some chief executives are choosing not to break with reality, recognising that the EPA’s move on the endangerment finding is “endangering” US businesses on climate.

Beyond companies simply continuing to do the work of meeting climate commitments quietly — many of which have been driven by concern for the bottom line — businesses should move into more forceful advocacy despite political risks.

Why? If the endangerment finding is repealed and if climate denialism continues to dominate US policy, there will probably be increased legal risk, regulatory disruptions and uncertainty, and the potential for American businesses to fall behind as markets globally continue the shift towards emissions reductions and a cleaner energy economy.

Companies once seen as potential climate leaders, such as Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce, should be using their lobbying power and political influence

Companies have invested billions in renewables — with those investments now at risk from ongoing policy uncertainty — and even most oil and gas companies support a national approach to limiting methane.

Businesses should be speaking up now for long-term regulatory stability and US competitiveness globally. Company leaders should remember commitments to shareholders, employees, customers and American communities.

The attacks on climate action will not slow the realities of climate change, or the associated risks. It is beyond time for companies to wield their influence on climate policy — especially those that recognise the very real material risks involved and who have made strong commitments to act.

For example, companies once seen as potential climate leaders, such as Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce, should be using their lobbying power and political influence to change the corporate climate landscape. With the complete absence of government leadership, there is even more of an imperative for businesses to act.

ClimateVoice continues to call on companies to lobby for climate solutions and publicly endorse climate policies.

Public comments to the EPA defending the endangerment finding can be submitted until September 22. Businesses can urge the EPA to maintain the endangerment finding to ensure a stable policy environment supporting long-term business planning and economic growth, while advancing a cleaner energy future.

Business leaders should band together and advocate openly through public statements and strong lobbying forces, along with urging trade groups to oppose rollbacks.

Companies must urgently consider their role at this critical moment, and end the trend towards corporate silence and complicity in an anti-climate agenda.

Silence will not lead us to a better future. Practising corporate political responsibility and moral courage will, if we act now.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/e442ea64-1b5f-4d18-a9e6-301eb9f8128c.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 07:59:25.621874

Allegheny County schools lead the state in potential for solar energy generation, advocates report

‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ casts shade over Pennsylvania’s solar boom

Pennsylvania’s Solar for Schools program awarded its first round of grant funding to 74 schools this spring. The program helps districts pay for the up-front costs of solar installations that will lower their utility bills in the long term.

Districts were expected to use the state money to take advantage of a federal solar tax credit, which became available to schools for the first time through former President Joe Biden’s climate law.

Fiedler’s office had said that by combining the state grants with the federal tax credit, schools could install solar arrays for free or a fraction of the usual cost.

Rooftop solar tax credits to expire with enough time for schools to install panels

Despite fears that Congress would pass a bill that would have killed the tax credits before the end of the year, a version of the tax bill that ultimately became law gives districts until next summer to start building their projects or start running them by the end of 2027, to still claim the credit.

“That’s not a rush,” said Micah Gold-Markel, founder of Philly-based solar energy installer Solar States. “We can get solar projects started in as little as two weeks. So, to start construction in a year and finish it in two years, that’s easily doable.”

The School District of Philadelphia is still pursuing its Solar for Schools projects, said spokesperson Christina Clark. The district plans to install solar panels at W.B. Saul High School, Northeast Community Propel Academy, Andrew Hamilton Elementary School and Murrell Dobbins CTE High School.

A report released by the nonprofit PennEnvironment found that if all roughly 5,000 of Pennsylvania’s schools installed solar panels, they could produce enough electricity to power around 187,000 homes per year, reduce planet-warming carbon emissions by as much as taking 300,000 cars off of roads and save schools more than $300 million over the lifetime of the solar energy systems.

In reality, fewer than half of the schools in the state would likely be capable of hosting solar on their rooftops, and even fewer would be able to install solar without first upgrading their roofs or electrical systems, Gold-Markel said.

PennEnvironment recommended policy changes that could make it easier for schools to actually install solar, including grants that cover roofing and electrical system upgrades.

“It’s clear that going solar is good for the environment, schools and students, and taking full advantage of Pennsylvania’s solar school potential requires supportive policies at every level of government,” said Flora Cardoni, deputy director of PennEnvironment.

Fiedler wants to see a second round of Solar for Schools funding included in the overdue state budget. She said even after the federal tax credit expires, the program will still benefit schools.

“Everyone who pays an energy bill is aware that energy prices are going up,” Fiedler said. “So everyone is trying to save money where they can, and the sun that’s up there waiting for us to harness its energy is a pretty good place.”

“There is huge demand for this program,” she added. “We believe that that’s going to continue.”",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/climate-change-pa-farmers-6-solar-panel-768x511.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-09-12 07:59:29.981618

This disruption underscores the growing interplay between regulatory risks—such as labor compliance and immigration enforcement—and operational challenges in the EV industry, with cascading effects on sector valuations.

Regulatory Risks and Labor Compliance: A Double-Edged Sword

The Georgia raid, which resulted in over 475 arrests, primarily impacted South Korean nationals working for LG's suppliersHyundai Says Battery Plant Delayed After Immigration Raid[ 1 ]. Hyundai CEO Jose Munoz attributed the delay to the “immediate repatriation of affected workers” and the difficulty of replacing specialized labor, noting that such skills are “not readily available in the U.S.”Hyundai Says Battery Plant Delayed After Immigration Raid[ 1 ]. This incident highlights the sector's reliance on cross-border labor and the fragility of supply chains when regulatory enforcement clashes with operational needs.

Historically, regulatory shifts have significantly influenced EV valuations. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced tax credits for EVs but also imposed stringent compliance requirements, while California's Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) program penalizes automakers up to $20,000 per missed zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) targetTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. These frameworks create financial pressures, forcing companies to balance compliance costs with market demands. Hyundai's delay adds to a pattern where regulatory missteps—whether immigration enforcement or emission penalties—can trigger short-term valuation declines and long-term reputational risks.

Operational Risks and Sector-Wide Valuation Trends

The EV sector has faced valuation volatility due to operational challenges. In 2024, Tesla's failure to meet delivery targets led to a 6.3% stock price drop, erasing $13.5 billion in market valueTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Similarly, Hyundai's reliance on a single battery plant in Georgia, now delayed, risks overexposure to localized disruptions. Analysts note that such bottlenecks amplify sector-wide risks, particularly as automakers race to meet aggressive EV production targets.

A broader trend reveals how operational risks—such as supply chain bottlenecks and production delays—have reshaped sector valuations. Between 2020 and 2024, the combined market capitalization of pure-play EV manufacturers fell by 20% despite global EV sales surging to 17 million unitsTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Battery makers like CATL have seen their stocks trade near three-year lows, reflecting investor skepticism about overcapacity and margin compressionTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Hyundai's delay, while not yet quantified in stock price terms, aligns with this pattern of volatility, where operational hiccups can erode investor confidence.

Geopolitical and Policy Headwinds: A Broader Context

The Georgia incident also occurs amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Reports indicate that Trump-era policies, including the repeal of the IRA and tariffs on critical battery components like graphite, have already weakened the U.S. battery supply chainTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. These policies have led to the cancellation of $21 billion in clean energy investments and projected job losses in the sectorTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Hyundai's delay, therefore, is not an isolated event but part of a larger narrative where policy shifts and enforcement actions create uncertainty for EV manufacturers.

Implications for Supply Chain Resilience

Hyundai's experience underscores the need for diversified supply chains and contingency planning. The company's pivot to sourcing batteries from its SK On plant demonstrates a short-term fix but highlights long-term risks if similar disruptions occur elsewhere. Industry analysts emphasize that resilience requires not only geographic diversification but also investments in local talent and regulatory alignment. For instance, Hyundai's Customer Assurance program—fixing MSRP prices to mitigate tariff impacts—shows proactive risk managementTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ].

Power management company Eaton and electric vehicle charger network ChargePoint have unveiled new EV charging infrastructure meant to provide ultrafast charging along with bidirectional charging capabilities, the companies announced Aug. 28.

The new ChargePoint Express Grid combines ChargePoint chargers with Eaton’s end-to-end power infrastructure to create a system that will “seamlessly synchronize onsite renewables, energy storage and vehicle batteries with local energy markets to help fleets significantly reduce fueling costs,” according to the press release.

The companies said the system will require a 30% smaller footprint with 30% fewer capital expenditures compared to typical chargers, ultimately cutting up to 30% of operational costs.

The new technology “will take DC fast charging to levels of performance and cost not previously imagined,” Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint, said in a statement.

ChargePoint and Eaton announced their partnership in May, promising “turnkey offerings” to simplify and accelerate the electrification transition in transportation.

“Combined with Eaton’s end-to-end grid capabilities, ChargePoint is delivering solutions to help EVs win on pure economics, regardless of tax incentives or government support,” Wilmer said.

The Trump administration had previously stalled federal funding of EV chargers, though it relaunched the program after a court order. In addition, federal EV tax credits are expiring this month due to the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill in July.

Commercial ChargePoint clients in North America and Europe can order the new infrastructure in early 2026, with deliveries expected in the second half of 2026. Eaton will build a custom, “site-ready” solution for each client, the release said.

“Our partnership with ChargePoint is an accelerator for innovation in electrification, with novel technology today and into the future that makes going electric the smart choice,” said Paul Ryan, vice president and general manager of energy transition at Eaton.

Workers from oil and gas, automotive, or other high-volume manufacturing sectors often bring valuable expertise that can be quickly repurposed for battery production.
Scaling production, deploying AI, and securing supply chains will all falter without a trained, adaptable, and future-ready workforce.
The technology may be advancing quickly, but as the panelists made clear, the future of the battery industry will be decided by its workforce.","The battery sector is in the midst of rapid transformation. Companies are racing to scale, new technologies are reshaping production, and workforce demands are evolving faster than talent pipelines can keep pace. These dynamics framed the recent Future-Charged Workforce webinar, which I hosted on behalf of the Volta Foundation, which brought together industry leaders to examine how the sector can prepare the workforce of tomorrow.

The panel consisted of Roshan Pujari (Stardust Power), Nicolina Nanni (Liminal Insights), Ajay Gnanasekaran (Argonne National Laboratory), and Veronika Wright (Electrification Academy). Together, they explored the major workforce shifts of the past five years, the emerging skills most in demand, and strategies to better align education with industry needs.

From R&D to scaling

A clear theme was the pivot away from R&D-heavy efforts toward full-scale implementation. As Roshan Pujari emphasized, the priority has shifted from experimentation to building the infrastructure that will allow the US to meet its energy needs. That transition requires retraining workforces from adjacent industries, strengthening regional training pipelines, and ensuring that new projects are rooted in local community engagement.

Broadening skills & data literacy

Where the workforce once drew primarily from engineering disciplines rooted in the physical, the skillset is now broadening. Nicolina Nanni stressed that data is no longer a byproduct but a strategic asset. Factory workers don't need to become data scientists, but they do need the literacy to interact with data, identify anomalies, and apply systems thinking to support AI-enabled quality inspection and predictive analytics.

AI, automation, & human judgment

AI and automation are reshaping battery manufacturing, but the panelists agreed these technologies will not replace people. Instead, they heighten the importance of human judgment.

""The more automation you have, the more human judgment really matters,"" Nanni observed.

The consensus was clear: technology adoption and workforce training must advance together, with continuous upskilling built into factory rollouts.

Bridging academia, industry, & communities

Ajay Gnanasekaran highlighted the role of national labs as facilitators, linking universities, vocational schools, and companies to build educational ecosystems around new industrial projects. Programs such as the Battery Workforce Challenge give students real-world experience under simulated industry conditions, producing graduates who are job-ready on day one.

He also stressed the importance of transferable skills. Workers from oil and gas, automotive, or other high-volume manufacturing sectors often bring valuable expertise that can be quickly repurposed for battery production. Effective workforce development strategies must account for these opportunities to retrain and redeploy existing labor pools.

A shared language for training

Closing the discussion, Veronika Wright pointed to a deeper challenge: the lack of a shared framework for battery education. Through her Electrification Academy initiative, she is mapping real industry workflows — from manufacturing and recycling to logistics and safety — and turning them into practical training resources.

She emphasized that while AI can provide facts about chemistries or fundamentals, it cannot capture the lessons learned on the factory floor. Sharing those experiences openly will be critical to avoid repeating mistakes as the industry scales.

Outlook: Workforce as the bottleneck

If one consensus emerged from the webinar, it was this: energy security depends on workforce security. Scaling production, deploying AI, and securing supply chains will all falter without a trained, adaptable, and future-ready workforce.

The message to companies, policymakers, and educators was clear — investing in talent pipelines is not optional but essential if the battery industry is to thrive in the decade ahead.

Next steps for the industry

To help benchmark progress, the Volta Foundation recently released the Battery Talent Census, the most comprehensive snapshot yet of hiring trends, salary benchmarks, and workforce dynamics across the ecosystem. And on October 2, the Battery Career Fair will provide a platform for connecting talent with employers, directly addressing one of the sector's most urgent needs.

By harnessing distributed energy resources, virtual power plants offer a flexible solution to reduce peak demand, lower costs for ratepayers, and enhance the resiliency of our energy system.
“Virtual power plants are a powerful tool to accelerate the energy transition and unlock new investment,” said Kelly Trombley, senior director, state policy, at Ceres.
Robust virtual power plant policies will ensure the state captures these economic and energy benefits.” x About Ceres","Leaders from across Minnesota convened Thursday to explore the promise of virtual power plants—an emerging energy solution that uses existing technologies like solar panels, battery storage, and smart thermostats to boost grid capacity and reliability while keeping costs down.

Virtual power plants are gaining national momentum for their ability to quickly and affordably add grid capacity by leveraging existing resources, reducing reliability risks as demand grows. At the event — which was convened by the business advocacy nonprofit Ceres and hosted at the McKnight Foundation offices in Minneapolis — stakeholders highlighted how virtual power plants could help Minnesota lower energy costs, strengthen grid reliability, create new jobs, and attract new investments in innovative grid solutions.

The cross-industry participants included representatives from Fresh Energy, Google, Minnesota Department of Commerce, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association, and Great Lakes Regional Organizing Committee, Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA), Minnesota and North Dakota.

“The Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association (MnSEIA) is excited to collaborate with the Commission, lawmakers, and stakeholders to advance the conversation around Virtual Power Plants in Minnesota. By harnessing distributed energy resources, virtual power plants offer a flexible solution to reduce peak demand, lower costs for ratepayers, and enhance the resiliency of our energy system. We look forward to partnering with legislators and advocates in the year ahead to drive these innovative programs forward,” said David Moberg, policy and regulatory affairs associate, Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association (MnSEIA).

""Utility investments in conventional energy infrastructure have created high-quality jobs and careers for generations of Minnesotans,” said Keven Pranis, marketing manager, Great Lakes Regional Organizing Committee, Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA), Minnesota and North Dakota. “As we bring new resources online, including through virtual power plants, it's important to make sure that the new jobs are as good and as available to local workers as the existing jobs, and that we are building career pipelines that reach communities that are historically underrepresented our energy industry.""

The convening comes ahead of a key deadline for major Minnesota utility Xcel Energy’s Distributed Capacity Procurement filing on October 3, 2025. Minnesota state lawmakers are expected to consider legislation in 2026 aimed at leveraging virtual power plants to affordably meet Minnesota's growing energy demand and help achieve the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

“Virtual power plants are a powerful tool to accelerate the energy transition and unlock new investment,” said Kelly Trombley, senior director, state policy, at Ceres. “By leveraging the untapped potential of businesses with large facilities that already generate onsite renewable power, Minnesota can maximize energy resources, quickly add grid capacity, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Robust virtual power plant policies will ensure the state captures these economic and energy benefits.”

“The harmful Public Lands Rule would have blocked access to use of public lands for outdoor recreation and also would have restricted energy production, grazing and forest management,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a statement.
He repeated the past assertion that the public lands rule last year was illegal.
“And this idea that somehow conservation was going to trump production agriculture — that's what this public lands rule is all about.
Furthermore, not all agriculture producers were against the rule, with 92% of the more than 150,000 public comments supporting the Public Lands Rule, according to a Center for Western Priorities analysis.","The Department of the Interior is proposing to quit the public land conservation rule finalized last year under the Biden administration and then legally challenged by Montana.

With the removal of the rule, the agency intends to open up public lands across the nation for mostly industry interests like energy development and agriculture.

The government's move was praised by Republicans and industry groups, while environmentalists said it would threaten wildlife, hunting and public access.

“The harmful Public Lands Rule would have blocked access to use of public lands for outdoor recreation and also would have restricted energy production, grazing and forest management,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a statement. “By rescinding the Public Lands Rule and unlocking more timber sales in Montana, we’ll be better able to manage our forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires.”

The Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, informally known as the Public Lands Rule, intends to help safeguard the health of public lands by defining conservation as an official use of public lands on equal footing with other activities like grazing or drilling. The Bureau of Land Management oversees roughly 8 million acres in Montana.

For more than two years, politicians, environmental groups and industry interests deliberated over whether the rule would lock up lands or protect and restore lands in a changing climate. Roughly 80% of BLM land is open to oil and gas development, something environmental groups believe comes at the expense of public access and conservation.

Once the rule was enacted in June last year, it was met with four separate legal challenges by industry interest groups and states, including by Montana.

The State of Montana joined the states of Idaho and North Dakota in a joint challenge to the rule in the U.S. District Court for North Dakota after it went into effect last May. The lawsuit said the Interior Department made the “radical leap” that conservation is on the same grounds of uses like drilling or grazing and is obstructing the development of public resources for climate change reasons.

The Department of Justice said the states’ interpretation of federal law was inaccurate and that the states lacked sufficient legal claims of harm. As of the start of the Trump administration, that lawsuit has been continually paused, according to recent court documents.

At a Billings agriculture roundtable Wednesday, Gov. Greg Gianforte said the difference between the Trump administration and the Biden administration has been ""night and day"" with communication on these issues. He repeated the past assertion that the public lands rule last year was illegal.

“Public lands need to be managed for multiple use, recreation and production agriculture,” Gianforte said. “And this idea that somehow conservation was going to trump production agriculture — that's what this public lands rule is all about. So, we fought the decision during the Biden administration to take public lands out of production agriculture in Montana.”

Contrary to what Gianforte told producers and the surrounding audience at the roundtable, conservation was not prioritized over other uses with the rule. It also directed the BLM to consider local community input in its decision making.

Furthermore, not all agriculture producers were against the rule, with 92% of the more than 150,000 public comments supporting the Public Lands Rule, according to a Center for Western Priorities analysis.

“Rural Montanans like me stake our livelihoods on healthy lands and clean waters,” Wade Sikorski, a farmer and rancher in Fallon County, said in a press release. “The Public Lands Rule is a tool in BLM’s toolbox to work with landowners and other interests to make sure land uses are equitably balanced to keep our lands healthy for future generations. It’s extremely disheartening that this administration is trying to dismantle this rule less than a year after it went into effect.”

The Interior Department stated in a press release that rescission of the rule would allow for the streamlining of permitting for industry interests and avoiding potential litigation.

The rule leads to land being “left idle,” rather than legitimate multiple-uses like grazing or energy development, according to the press release. The rescission comes at a time where the Trump administration is trying to push for greater domestic energy production, primarily in the realm of fossil fuels. The release referenced Trump’s executive order on ""Unleashing American Energy,"" and said it would eliminate unnecessary barriers to energy development.

The proposed rescission of the rule follows other recent industry-friendly actions reversing years of federal actions like a reduced federal royalty rate for coal, oil and gas. Another proposed federal rescission would repeal a 2001 Roadless Rule for national forests and in the process open up around 6 million federal acres in Montana for development.

Environmental groups said the latest proposed rule rescission is one in a string of action tilting public land to industry interests.

“Every one of this administration’s public-lands policies is designed to sell out public access, recreation, clean water and wildlife to boost corporate profits,” Wild Montana federal policy director Aubrey Bertram said in a press release “‘Multiple-use’ doesn’t mean that oil and gas corporations get to dictate what happens to our public lands. Rolling back the Public Lands Rule is another way to cut out public input, undermine local management and give industry and billionaires control of the places where we hike, hunt, fish, camp and ride.”

Public comment will be open through the Federal Register in a 60-day comment period running through Nov. 10.

Atom-smashing fusion devices replicating the power of the sun. Sleek next-gen nuclear reactors splitting isotopes.

So what is Dan Schwartz, founding director of the University of Washington’s Clean Energy Institute, excited about?

Solar power and batteries.

President Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the roof of the White House in 1979. Omnipresent lithium-ion batteries go back decades. Where’s the thrill?

“I love fusion,” Schwartz said. “I love that we are the fusion capital of the world in this region. But there’s no utility that has on their 10-year planning document … a fusion reactor or even a small modular reactor, or even a conventional nuclear reactor. You’re just not going to build those in 10 years.”

Schwartz shared his expertise on clean energy solutions at a Seattle CityClub Civic Cocktail event Wednesday evening held in the city’s downtown. The conversation included fellow panelists Emily Moore, director of climate and energy for the Sightline Institute think tank, and Gregg Small, executive director of the nonprofit Climate Solutions. I moderated the conversation.

Washington state and the rest of the world are racing to deploy clean energy solutions amid surging demand. The rapid expansion of AI-powered data centers has intensified power consumption needs, while transportation, building heating and cooling, and industrial operations are increasingly shifting to electricity as they transition away from fossil fuels.

There are fusion and nuclear projects being deployed today. Helion Energy this summer began construction near the Columbia River on what it hopes will be the world’s first commercial fusion reactor. If all goes to plan, Microsoft has promised to buy energy from the facility, which should be running by 2028. Washington’s TerraPower is building its first small modular reactor in Wyoming and aims to operate by 2030.

While cutting-edge companies are launching new electricity sources, significant components of these technologies often still need to be proven at scale, and the supply chains aren’t close to ready for rapid deployment.

“Solar is really the cheapest, fastest thing that you can install today for new generating capacity, and when it’s coupled with a battery, it is really a tremendous new resource for the grid,” Schwartz said.

Batteries can store excess power that’s produced by solar panels when the sun is shining and then provide electricity at night, making renewable energy available around the clock.

And the truth is, these technologies have advanced dramatically since the days of President Carter and the original Energizer Bunny. The UW’s Clean Energy Institute is helping facilitate some of that work by providing expertise and lab space to innovators.

In solar energy, researchers are developing new technologies that are much more efficient at generating power than existing photovoltaic cells. That includes materials that can capture energy from solar wavelengths that aren’t normally tapped into.

Companies such as Group14 Technologies, Sila and Ecellix are operating in Washington, building and producing materials to significantly improve battery performance — making them more powerful, longer lasting and faster to recharge.

Efforts are underway to eliminate “conflict minerals” from batteries — materials often mined under conditions involving forced labor, child labor, corruption and environmental damage. According to Schwartz, batteries now use about 10% as much cobalt as they did a decade or two ago, with the industry shifting toward abundant minerals like iron, sodium and sulfur.

And finally, there are mounting efforts to recycle and reuse solar panels and batteries. Schwartz even sees an opportunity for Amazon to get into the field — perhaps evolving from books to cloud to batteries?

“There is a whole economy waiting to be created out of [used] batteries if we can understand their state of health and then value them,” he said. “Honestly, I think it could be Amazon’s biggest business, creating a marketplace for this because it is a massively increasing asset.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sep-10-25-Civic-Cocktail-66-1260x840.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 23:59:01.139853

See our briefing notes “ CSRD – The European Commission Proposes Significant Deregulation” and “ CSRD and the Omnibus Proposal – Implications for Asset Managers”.","The pace of change with regard to attitudes, laws and regulations on climate change matters in the ten years since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 has been head spinning. In the early years of the past decade, there appeared to be a growing international consensus on the need to finance the transition to net zero. In its ambitious Sustainable Finance Action Plan, published in 2018, the European Union (“EU”) sought to position itself as a global leader in the area of sustainable finance, introducing a complex framework of new disclosure rules intended to provide investors with the information they needed to make investments aligned with their sustainability goals. In the US, at a federal level, the SEC proposed rules aiming to standardise how companies report their climate-related risks and impacts, while a large number of states introduced sustainability reporting regulations. The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) introduced significant tax incentives to facilitate the transition towards sustainable energy.

In more recent years, we have seen the US's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and denouncement of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), legal challenges to the SEC's proposed corporate disclosure rules, ultimately leading to their defence being abandoned earlier this year, and a significant rollback on the clean energy tax credits and other climate-related provisions in the IRA. A number of US states have implemented policies to restrict ESG considerations in state investments, requiring investment decisions to be based solely on financial considerations, and “blacklisting” asset managers deemed to be boycotting fossil fuels. A number of asset managers have withdrawn from climate initiatives such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which had launched as recently as 2020 but suspended its activities in January of this year.

The EU's Ongoing Commitment

The “ESG backlash” and change in the administration in the US coincided with the reconstitution of the European Commission in 2024, a year in which both the Letta1 and Draghi2 reports on the future of the EU's single market and on EU competitiveness were published. The EU's renewed focus on competitiveness and growth posed questions as to whether the EU would pursue its European Green Deal with continued zeal, particularly in light of the prospect of increasing deregulation across the Atlantic. President von der Leyen's mission letter3 to Commissioner Albuquerque reaffirmed the Commission's climate objectives, including its goal to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050, and its commitment to the UN SDGs and the Green Deal. The letter made it clear that the EU intends to remain a global leader in sustainable finance, referring to scaling up sustainable finance, in particular transition finance and climate resilience.

The Simplification Agenda

Notably, the mission letter also referred to the Commission's focus on reducing administrative burdens and simplifying legislation, including reducing reporting obligations by at least 25%. The new Commission acted with purpose in this regard, publishing the Omnibus I proposal in February of this year, which includes proposals to significantly reduce the scope of the reporting requirements under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) and proposed amendments to reporting obligations under the Taxonomy Regulation. While the proposals have been described by the Commission as ‘simplification' rather than ‘deregulation' efforts, the effect of the proposals, if adopted, would be to significantly scale-back CSRD reporting obligations, with 80% of companies taken out of scope and a two-year delay to reporting for those that would continue to be subject to the CSRD.4

From a burden reduction perspective, the CSRD changes will no doubt be welcomed by many EU companies. However, reduced sustainability reporting poses challenges to fund managers already dealing with significant data challenges in meeting their obligations under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“SFDR”) and the Taxonomy Regulation. To fill the data gap, fund managers will have to continue to rely on ESG data and ratings sold by third-party providers, potentially increasing costs for investors. The fact that ESG data providers remain unregulated at EU level, and that ESG data is not standardised and often incomparable, adds to the compliance challenges for asset managers. The lack of available, reliable data will likely lead to the increased use of estimates in meeting disclosure obligations, which, in the absence of clear guidance on the use of such estimates, may increase the risk of greenwashing and undermine the trust and confidence of investors in the financial system.

Recognising that the “regulatory burden has become a brake on Europe's competitiveness”,5 the Commission's simplification agenda includes proposals to address the issue of fragmentation and the unnecessary duplication of regulatory burdens, particularly the barriers and costs relating to operating group structures across EU member states and to the distribution of investment funds across the EU, with legislative proposals expected later this year.6

The review of the SFDR, one of the cornerstones of the EU's sustainable finance framework, does not fit neatly into this new simplification and burden reduction agenda. Work on the review of the SFDR commenced in 2023, prior to the publication of the Draghi report and the reconstitution of the Commission, and the introduction of a new product classification regime to replace the current disclosure regime is difficult to reconcile with a simplification objective. While criticisms of the current SFDR censuring the complexity of the disclosures for retail investors and questioning the usefulness of the disclosures for professional investors are warranted, asset managers have already incurred significant compliance costs and made substantial changes in order to comply with the disclosure regime and are now faced with a further potentially significant overhaul of the framework.

One of the most notable challenges in implementing the SFDR related to the misalignment in timing of the introduction of obligations. For example, the EU imposed detailed disclosure obligations on market participants at a time when there were no corresponding reporting obligations on investee companies, creating significant data gaps and resulting in less comparable, comprehensible disclosures for investors, undermining the purpose of the EU disclosure regime. The proposed reduced scope of the CSRD is likely to compound these challenges.

There continues to be misalignment between the SFDR, the Taxonomy Regulation and the provisions relating to investor's sustainability preferences in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”). A more coherent, consistent framework should be the objective of an holistic approach to the Omnibus I Proposal, the SFDR review and a future review of MiFID.

What do investors have to say?

In addition to diverging policy and regulatory approaches with regard to ESG reporting and disclosures, there may also be divergence in investor preferences between the EU and US. In both jurisdictions, the geopolitical environment has drawn attention away from sustainability issues and towards economic growth, competitiveness and defence. While assets in global ESG funds ended 2024 8% higher than in 2023 to reach an annual record high of $3.2 trillion, inflows had been declining in the three years prior to 2025, and redemptions were at a record high of $11.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025 globally. While not representative of an established pattern, in the second quarter of 2025, European investors drove a recovery in sustainable funds, investing $8.6 billion of net new money into ESG funds over those three months, after redeeming $7.3 billion in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, the US saw the eleventh consecutive quarter of withdrawals.7

There has also been a marked difference between the EU and the US in relation to the level of support for shareholder resolutions with an ESG objective, with asset managers in the UK and Europe supporting 81% of shareholder ESG proposals on average in 2024, compared with 25% support in the US.8 New restrictions on permissible shareholder resolutions introduced by the SEC earlier this year preceded a sharp fall in the number of environmental and social proposals submitted to shareholder vote. Arguably, this could impact US companies' insight into the market's view of financially material ESG themes.9

There have been instances of EU pension funds withdrawing from or reviewing mandates with asset managers that have revised their ESG credentials or withdrawn from climate initiatives such as NZAM and Climate Action 100+. Although it may be too early to determine whether this is the “early phase of a broader movement”, European pension funds and other long-term asset owners remain committed to sustainable investing.10

(WTRF) — Hancock County Commissioner Eron Chek is highlighting hydropower development along the Ohio River as a key to long-term energy, economic and community growth.

In his September newsletter, Chek called hydropower the “original renewable,” noting that projects such as the Current Hydro initiative at New Cumberland and Pike Island represent more than just clean energy.

“Hydropower is steady, reliable, and — when designed right — protects the health of the river ecosystem while fueling economic opportunity for decades to come,” Chek wrote.

Chek outlined four major benefits of local hydropower.

Business: Companies applying for permits score higher when they can demonstrate diverse energy use, giving Hancock County businesses a competitive edge.

Jobs: Hydropower projects bring construction, operations and maintenance work, boosting local restaurants, suppliers and housing.

Future: The Current Hydro project is designed to power Hancock County and the surrounding region for a century or more, Chek said.

Grid stability: Hydropower provides base-load electricity, strengthening the local energy system.

Chek added that hydropower projects are designed to serve communities for more than 100 years, unlike other forms of energy. He said the Current Hydro project is part of a forward-thinking investment meant to keep Hancock County competitive, sustainable and attractive to new opportunities.

“Hydropower is more than just electricity — it’s a cornerstone for community development,” Chek wrote. “By harnessing the Ohio River responsibly, we’re creating opportunities for business, strengthening our economy, and securing a reliable energy future.”

It’s a new energy task force in North Carolina, and EDF is honored to have a role in this state initiative to meet the challenge of rising electricity demand. If we fail to build enough electricity generation to keep up with rising demand, that will mean bill shock for NC households. Many people have opened the highest electricity bill of their life this summer, a trend that will continue if we don’t find a way to get costs under control while phasing out our coal fleet and finding the right mix of next-generation technologies.

We’re in a time of broader uncertainty, with federal policy in flux and high interest rates challenging developers and utilities who need to make investments in their growing systems.

But North Carolina has a history of innovating in power sector regulation, regardless of what is happening in Washington, DC. The Clean Smokestacks Act in 2002 helped clean up an aging coal fleet, and House Bill 951 in 2021 set power sector emission reduction targets to put the state on a path towards a cleaner, more diversified energy generation portfolio. We must set our own course and learn from other states who are experimenting with new ways to meet power demand, which is rising faster than traditional power plants like coal, gas or nuclear, and can realistically be built.

We have to expand the range of options on the table to meet a surge in demand from data centers and new industrial sources. That means tapping into batteries on people’s homes, incentivizing large facilities to reduce their usage during peak demand times and building as much of the quickest-to-market resources we can — which are primarily solar and batteries.

Two steps forward, one step back

We took a step backwards from that vision this year with the passage of Senate Bill 266 (S266), which relies on the false hope that slowing our investment in clean energy will save ratepayers money. But we can’t meet rising demand simply by running more aging, dirty coal and gas. Not only does this lead, as it did in June, to the utilities requesting emergency exemptions to exceed local air pollution limits, but it puts regular households on the hook for rising natural gas prices, which the federal Energy Information Agency projects to rise as demand rises, while supply remains flat.

That’s a big part of why an N.C. State University study showed S266 could cost North Carolinians an additional $23 billion in power bill payments through 2050. Instead of modernizing the grid with affordable clean energy, the bill would encourage Duke Energy to rely on older plants and costly gas-fired facilities. EDF-commissioned analysis also found S266 would saddle households with nearly $90 million in extra annual costs to finance power bill discounts for the state’s largest commercial and industrial energy users. And an analysis of the last seven years of power bills shows that volatile gas prices are responsible for up to 67% of the recent rise in North Carolina energy costs.

As EDF’s NC State Director David Kelly put it in this WRAL article, S266 is “an energy tax in disguise,” forcing families to pay more for gas plants we don’t need, and that our climate and working families can’t afford. Doubling down on expensive fossil fuels guarantees more of the same: higher bills and more pollution.

Leading the pack or falling behind?

But S266 does not mean that North Carolina can’t chart a cheaper, cleaner course. The NC Energy Policy Task Force is composed of a set of experts, assembled to ensure that as our state’s energy needs grow, we meet them affordably and transparently.

Along these lines, the new Task Force will tackle two critical priority areas:

Large Load Growth Management

North Carolina needs a plan for integrating large industrial power needs without overburdening residents or rolling back clean energy commitments. The Task Force will examine the full set of solutions — from accelerating clean generation to improving grid efficiency — so that rapid demand growth can be met fairly and sustainably.

Modeling & Transparency

Right now, the long-term utility planning process is often opaque and inaccessible to the public. Utilities make multi-billion-dollar investment decisions with little visibility into the assumptions behind them. The Task Force will change that by creating a public, parallel modeling process — based on the same tools used by utilities — so stakeholders can see exactly how decisions are made, test assumptions, and explore cleaner, more affordable options.

Clean energy is the affordability solution North Carolina needs

North Carolina households are already feeling the pinch from volatile fuel prices and rising bills. By tracking best practices nationwide from other states tackling the same challenges, the Policy Energy Task Force can build consensus around a toolbox of policies for our General Assembly and Utilities Commission to protect ratepayers, meet our climate goals, and build a stronger energy future for everyone in North Carolina.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//NC-Task-Force-Blog.png,N,,2025-09-11 20:01:15.902370

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.

“No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales.
It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.","Somehow the auto industry and consumers are figuring out how to deal with the double jeopardy of import tariffs and the impending end of federal tax credits for many electric vehicles, and it’s not at all how insiders thought it would all go down.

When President Donald Trump announced he planned to impose stiff tariffs on imported vehicles among other products, consumers made a mad dash to dealer lots to beat expected price hikes on post-tariff vehicles.

The expectations were dealers would be left with fewer vehicles on their lots and prices would skyrocket on cars and trucks made outside the United States and sales would tank.

It all seemed logical, but sometimes logic doesn’t mirror reality.

Indeed, what happened over the summer is more like an amusement park ride to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke.

“So you’re seeing inventory deliveries slow down, but yet sales are stronger. So we are seeing supply tighten, a bit like it was back in 2021 or 2022, but it’s created what I’ll call this summer, particularly, a love roller coaster,” observed Smoke during a panel on sales trends at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit on Thursday.

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.

That expected tariff-triggered price spike? It was more like a thumb tack.

Average new vehicle prices rose only about a hundred bucks between July and August from $49,400 to $49,500, according the Car Gurus August 2025 Intelligence Report released Thursday.

“Even with rising import costs and economic uncertainty, the market is showing surprising strength. Prices for both new and used vehicles held steady in August, while demand hit multi-year highs. For buyers, that means strong competition for value models—especially affordable EVs, which surged ahead of upcoming tax credit changes,” wrote report author Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market Intelligence at CarGurus.

There’s also the fear of missing out factor, even if not missing out on a new car or truck means missing out on the make or model first on a consumer’s list.

“There's still this disconnect, sort of between how consumers are feeling and what they're doing,” observed Ford Motor Company chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris during Thursday’s panel. “So they may be rushing out to get what they think are the last of the deals. They don't seem to be particularly happy about it.”

So who’s picking up the tab on the added tariff expense? It’s not that easy.

In keeping with Smoke’s “love roller coaster” there are ups and downs. Average list prices of new vehicles actually fell about $500 from $50,000 to $49,500 between April 2 and August 31, according to the CarGurus report.

While some automakers did lower their prices, some, including the Detroit Three companies, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Hyundai, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover boosted theirs as 2026 models reach showrooms.

But don’t be fooled. That doesn’t mean the cost of other vehicle brands declined as automakers found ways to make up the difference, according to Jessica Caldwell, AVP insights, at auto research site Edmunds.com.

“We have seen is an increase in destination prices in 2025 model year, the average destination was over $1,500. That's another like way I think that you could see some cost increases, and then also changes in vehicle contenting and trim levels,” Caldwell said during the panel discussion.

Indeed, while the combination of pent up demand and ample inventories propped up sales over the summer, Smoke warns consumers are likely to soon see prices affected by tariffs as 2026 models arrive.

“About a quarter of what dealers have on their lots being model year ‘26 so we are seeing more of an acceleration in the increase in MSRP and invoice and average transaction price, but it's still well within what is normal for inflation,” Smoke said.

If the import tariffs are Thing One, the demise after September 30 of federal EV tax credits qualifies as Thing Two.

The rush to beat the deadline is continuing through September, with Smoke predicting record EV sales for the third quarter, boosted by both urgency from consumers and record incentives from some automakers.

But come October, the party is likely to be over.

“We’re going to hit a speed bump when those credits go away,” predicted Smoke. “No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales. So I would expect this to have a little bit of a hangover that's going to last us at least through the first quarter of next year.”

Given automakers already laid on generous incentives, Morris notes there’s not much more they can offer to mitigate loss of the tax credits. It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.

All three panelists agreed EV adoption is simply a slower process than the industry had hoped it would be, but that more consumers who desire some sort of electrified vehicle prefer hybrids.

“For a lot of people, a hybrid is fine, like, that's enough of a change,” said Caldwell. “Because I think for an EV, there is that fatigue of trying to learn something else, and especially like in the post-Covid world, where everyone is really stressed out, and we see this in customer surveys, is they don't necessarily want to buy an EV because they just don't want to. They don't want to deal with the hassle. They've got to figure out the charging situation and all of that, and you just don't want to deal with it.”

One thing is for sure, asserts Smoke, is that the number of internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles is beyond the point of growth, declaring that in terms of sales and those on the road, “we’re past peak ICE.”

Indeed, both consumers and the auto industry need to come to grips with a stark reality, said Smoke.

Overall, the Act puts more than half a trillion dollars of clean energy and transportation investment at risk of cancellation, Rhodium Group has estimated.
“It also puts new economic pressure on operating facilities that manufacture clean energy technology—tied to nearly $150 billion of investment—given greatly reduced domestic demand for these products,” it added.
The total impact on America’s clean energy could be even bigger, depending on how executive actions shape the law’s implementation, Rhodium Group says.
These are “early indicators of federal policy attacks and fluctuating trade policy undermining American energy security and economic growth,” the association said.","The Trump Administration’s openly hostile policy toward wind, solar, and electric vehicles is setting the stage for much slower emissions reductions than previously anticipated, a new report says.

The U-turn in U.S. energy policies under President Donald Trump could more than halve the pace of America’s decarbonization, research provider Rhodium Group said in its annual Taking Stock 2025 analysis this week.

“Openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles”

Solar and wind installations and EV uptake could nosedive with the expiry of subsidies earlier than planned and plans to dismantle the so-called endangerment finding. This finding, from 2009, represents the U.S. federal government’s formal conclusion that greenhouse gases harm the public and cause climate change. This finding has acted as the legal foundation for many U.S. laws and regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

As part of the Trump Administration’s rollback of climate laws and provisions, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding—a move welcomed by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as “a monumental step toward returning to commonsense policies that expand access to affordable, reliable, secure energy and improve quality of life for all Americans.”

Related: EU Court Upholds Green Label for Gas and Nuclear Energy

For the Trump Administration, reliable and affordable energy means more fossil fuels and nuclear power generation, at the expense of unreliable, weather-dependent, and heavily-subsidized (until now) wind and solar energy and EVs.

“The first seven months of the second Trump administration and 119th Congress have seen the most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory,” Rhodium Group said in its report.

“After the Biden administration adopted meaningful policies to drive decarbonization, Congress and the White House are now enacting a policy regime that is openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles and seeks to promote increased fossil fuel production and use.”

The Chilling Effect in Solar and Wind

Taking Stock, Rhodium Group’s annual outlook of future emissions under current policy, found the U.S. is on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-41% in 2040 relative to 2005 levels. Emissions levels will decline by 26-35% in 2035, considerably lower than the estimate in the 2024 report, which showed a steeper drop of 38-56% by 2035 compared to 2005.

The high emissions scenario, the most pessimistic of the three scenarios examined in the 2025 report, suggests the pace of decarbonization in the U.S. would more than halve through 2040, with annual average emissions reductions of just 0.4% from 2025 through 2040 compared to 1.1% from 2005 through 2024. In the mid and low emissions scenarios, the pace of decarbonization accelerates instead, with annual average reductions of 1.4% and 1.9% through 2040, respectively, representing a 22% and 70% acceleration, compared with the pace of the last two decades.

“Despite the volume of policymaking from the executive branch, the single largest climate and energy policy action came in the federal legislative realm with passage of the fiscal year 2025 budget reconciliation bill, dubbed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act,’” Rhodium Group said.

The OBBBA is expected to cut the build-out of new clean power-generating capacity by 53-59% over the next decade, according to the research provider.

Overall, the Act puts more than half a trillion dollars of clean energy and transportation investment at risk of cancellation, Rhodium Group has estimated.

“It also puts new economic pressure on operating facilities that manufacture clean energy technology—tied to nearly $150 billion of investment—given greatly reduced domestic demand for these products,” it added.

The total impact on America’s clean energy could be even bigger, depending on how executive actions shape the law’s implementation, Rhodium Group says.

For the solar industry, OBBBA will have a muted impact in the near term as developers rush to complete projects to qualify for tax incentives by 2027, Wood Mackenzie said earlier this month. However, the longer-term outlook has now worsened due to new barriers to permitting and penalties for reliance on China-based solar manufacturers.

The latest U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies put the United States at risk of losing 44 gigawatts (GW) of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline.

The report finds that 77% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states won by President Trump, including 8 of the top 10 states for new solar installations: Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

“Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO.

According to Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, “Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.”

Wind energy faces significant hurdles, too.

While wind installations jumped in the first quarter of the year, total turbine orders for the first half of 2025 plunged by 50%, to the lowest level since 2020, the U.S. Wind Energy Monitor report by Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP) showed.

An ACP market report found that U.S. clean power development pipeline showed virtually no growth, as solar installations declined by 23% in the first half of 2025, and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) plummeted. These are “early indicators of federal policy attacks and fluctuating trade policy undermining American energy security and economic growth,” the association said.

“The uncertainty created by new bureaucratic delays and unclear demands is having a chilling effect on the pipeline for future energy projects, stalling growth precisely when our nation needs more energy to power a growing economy,” ACP CEO Jason Grumet noted.

Saudi Arabia, for example, has announced plans to invest up to $10bn in green hydrogen producers.","While the technology underpinning the use of hydrogen as a fuel source dates back almost 200 years, green hydrogen — hydrogen produced using carbon neutral or renewable resources — is a relatively new concept.

Green hydrogen is produced from water through the use of electrolyzers, one of US energy company Plug Power’s [PLUG] main products. The scale of green energy infrastructure buildout can therefore be traced in the growth of global electrolyzer capacity.

In its Global Hydrogen Review 2024, the IEA forecast that electrolyzers with a combined capacity of 5.2GW would be installed by the end of the year, compared to 0.6GW in 2021, as shown in the graph below.

On a company scale, the growth is even more impressive. As CEO Andy Marsh explains, “about five years ago, the largest user of liquid hydrogen in the world was actually NASA. And Plug is bigger than NASA today … we’re the largest user in the world.”

This scale, in turn, translates directly into more clients running on Plug’s hydrogen. “Here in the States, which is just a portion of our business, about 30% of retail food actually moves through products that are produced by Plug Power.”

Building an Ecosystem

While headquartered in Slingerlands, New York, the company has facilities in Rochester and Spokane, Washington, as well as staff in Europe and India. The company operates a green hydrogen plant in Georgia and a plant in Tennessee, with daily production capacities of 15 tons and 10 tons, respectively. It is also developing a 120MW green hydrogen plant in Graham, Texas. In April 2025, Plug Power and Olin Corporation [OLN] opened a hydrogen liquefaction plant in Louisiana with a capacity of 15 tons per day.

These facilities are part of a network that helps power client operations, including for big names such as Amazon [AMZN], Walmart [WMT] and Home Depot [HD].

While Plug’s hydrogen network is already operational, one of the key markers of success is being carbon neutral from start to finish.

Indeed, the company has built the industry’s first vertically integrated green hydrogen ecosystem. From wind power in its Texas projects to switching charging stations off coal, “from an end-to-end point of view, it’ll be zero carbon emissions.”

While complete carbon neutrality has not yet been realized, the infrastructure is in place. As Marsh explains, “what’s really critical is that these devices are there as the grid becomes more renewable, as our hydrogen becomes, from end to end, completely green.”

Freeing up energy on the grid for other applications helps add to hydrogen’s value proposition. “We’ve taken the equivalent of 400 megawatts of electricity off the grid”, the equivalent of a medium-sized power plant. “We did that either through time shifting or, in many cases, by cleaning up dirty hydrogen sources.”

These kinds of efficiencies are essential, Marsh argues, especially in an era when companies are looking for reliable power for data centers, the backbone of the artificial intelligence boom. “By moving the fuel cells to hydrogen, more electricity is available for other usage.”

Hydrogen, thanks to the fact it can be stored, in turn makes other green energy sources more viable — and more reliable. “You can be running your grid through fuel cells and hydrogen, and that hydrogen was produced when there was way too much wind and way too much solar. So [hydrogen] really makes the possibility of a complete renewable network realizable.”

Making Hydrogen Competitive

However, like many carbon-neutral technologies, green hydrogen production is hindered by high costs and limited infrastructure. Natural gas — a cheaper but less sustainable fuel source than green hydrogen — offers a useful comparison. “There’s going to become a point, and it’s not too far out, where hydrogen is on par with natural gas from energy content … And when the cost of hydrogen is equal to the cost of natural gas, there’ll be no reason for people to buy natural gas turbines.”

Plug is building for this eventuality. “When that day comes, we’re ready,” Marsh explains. “We have the facilities in place, we have the people in place, we have the capabilities in place.”

International competition is fierce for hydrogen projects, with many countries setting ambitious hydrogen production targets. Saudi Arabia, for example, has announced plans to invest up to $10bn in green hydrogen producers. China, meanwhile, has set a target to produce 100,000–200,000 tons of green hydrogen by the end of the year, though it is on course to exceed that level. According to Marsh, however, the US remains the clear leader in the hydrogen race, thanks to its technological edge. “Just like in any competitive environment, we need to continue to innovate and keep on making sure our products are better.

“Don’t worry about the competition,” he says. “Worry about serving customers.”

In the end, the goal is simple, Marsh notes. “Nothing works unless hydrogen is competitive.”",https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/plug_1200px.jpg_medium.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 20:02:06.824844

U.S. EV sales reach new records in August, with more growth expected

Tesla is losing ground in China and most countries in Europe, but the U.S. is by far the biggest market, and it is losing ground here, too.

In August, Tesla's market share in the U.S. shrank to 38%, down from 80% at its height.

While some of that degradation is tied to increased competition here in the States, the decline in more mature markets like Europe and China could be a serious problem for the automaker.

U.S. EV sales rose to 9.9% of all new car sales in August, a 10% jump from the 9.1% share held in July and the highest-ever record, according to Cox Automotive data.

Market share increased despite an uptick in prices, as the average transaction price (ATP) for an EV was $57,245 in August, a 3.1% increase. The ATP for a traditional new vehicle rose just 0.5% to $49,077.

Tesla gears up to pivot away from EVs

Last month, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk released the Master Plan 4, the fourth (or third, depending on how you count) iteration of Musk's grand scheme for the company's future.

However, Master Plan 4 is different from its predecessors. It's much less about the green revolution or even electric vehicles and more about a future with Tesla-branded humanoid robots known as Optimus.

""What is the happiest future you can imagine?"" Musk asks at the end of the video, announcing his plans. ""Sustainable abundance for all.""

The text version of Master Plan Part 4 mentions sustainable abundance five times.

As the country pushes for greener power and energy independence, the agreement marks a major step toward making solar not just cleaner but truly local.

Starting in late 2026, Corning will supply solar wafers from its Michigan factory that T1 will use to make solar cells at a new facility in Austin, Texas. Those cells will then be assembled into panels at T1's existing Dallas-area plant.

T1 CEO Daniel Barcelo said in a statement, per Reuters: ""This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security.""

The timing is key. With solar demand rising and new federal rules favoring American-made components, this deal reduces dependence on China, currently the world's leading wafer producer, and boosts both clean energy and U.S. manufacturing.

By making solar panels cheaper and more locally available, the deal could help lower energy costs for households while also cutting harmful carbon pollution by replacing fossil fuels with clean, homegrown power.

It also supports thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs, keeping the benefits of the clean energy transition rooted in local communities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the guidance clarifies when “actual construction” begins under NSR, distinguishing emissions-unit work from broader site activities that do not affect air emissions.
However, that has caused some uncertainty over whether activities such as site grading, foundation pouring, and equipment staging require a permit.
The Code of Federal Regulations currently defines “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature.
“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” Zeldin said on Tuesday.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued new guidance under its New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program that could allow power plant developers to begin certain non-emissions‐related site work—such as installing concrete pads, grading, and utility trenching—before obtaining a Clean Air Act construction permit. The change, described in a sparse set of paragraphs published on the agency’s website on Sept. 10, is designed to shave months off project timelines for power generation, data centers, and reshored manufacturing facilities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the guidance clarifies when “actual construction” begins under NSR, distinguishing emissions-unit work from broader site activities that do not affect air emissions. By defining which early-stage tasks fall outside the permitting trigger, the EPA seeks to reduce regulatory delays that have long hindered the build-out of essential infrastructure and to bolster U.S. competitiveness in artificial intelligence (AI), energy, and advanced manufacturing, he suggested.

The agency is expected to follow up with a formal rulemaking in early 2026 to revise the regulatory definition of “Begin Actual Construction” in 40 CFR § 52.21 and codify the distinction between emissions units and other parts of a facility.

The EPA says it will continue issuing case-by-case guidance in the interim.

A Few Words to Describe a Big Change

The Clean Air Act’s New Source Review program requires major stationary sources of air pollution, including power plants and industrial boilers, to obtain preconstruction permits before beginning emission-related construction or modifications. Historically, the review process has been considered “very complex,” a murky framework shaped by decades of lawsuits, political battles, and shifting regulatory interpretations—so much so that, as POWER noted in 2008, even standard operation and maintenance projects have sometimes been treated as potential NSR violations, leaving utilities wary that “a little paranoia about NSR might just be prudent.”

Typically, the EPA and delegated state agencies have interpreted “begin actual construction” to encompass nearly all on-site work of a permanent nature, even when unrelated to emissions units. However, that has caused some uncertainty over whether activities such as site grading, foundation pouring, and equipment staging require a permit.

The Code of Federal Regulations currently defines “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures” (40 CFR §52.21(b)(11)). As they apply to a change in the method of operations, the term covers “on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change.”

Under the new guidance, preparatory activities that do not involve the physical construction of an emissions unit—defined as any apparatus that emits or controls emissions—may proceed without an NSR permit, provided they pose no air-quality risk. Authorized tasks include soil stabilization, installation of access roads, laydown yards, precast foundation elements, and installation of non-emitting equipment such as concrete pads and underground piping.

According to the EPA, the clarification is part of Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative launched in February and is intended to “expedite construction of essential power generation and industrial facilities.” The agency said its actions will help permitting authorities “properly distinguish between emissions units and other parts of a facility that are not an emissions unit or part of an emissions unit,” ensuring that developers understand which activities can advance without a permit and which must remain on hold until a permit is issued.

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” Zeldin said on Tuesday. “We are continuing to fix this broken system. Today’s guidance is another step to allow the build out of essential power generation, data centers, and manufacturing projects that will bring about America’s Golden Age.”

Aligned with the Trump administration’s policies, Zeldin has championed more than $90 billion in energy and industrial investments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit in July. In a Fox News op-ed following that event, Zeldin underscored the EPA’s commitment to “clear the regulatory path” for data centers and manufacturing facilities that support America’s AI leadership while maintaining environmental safeguards.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nre-epa.png,N,,2025-09-11 18:00:28.623120

With federal electric vehicle tax credits set to end on September 30, it could be your best, and perhaps last chance, to cash in on some serious savings. Tech Expert Jennifer Jolly joins our Laura Cavanaugh with what the changes mean and what you need to know before time runs out.

Electric vehicle tax credits are vanishing fast by the end of the month. The federal EV tax credit — up to $7,500 for new “clean vehicles” and $4,000 for used — is going away on September 30. The credits were meant to last until 2032, but are being pulled as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill. That means potential buyers could lose out on thousands of dollars in savings in just a few weeks. The tax credits are actually applied directly at the dealership, knocking thousands of dollars off the sticker price or it can also function as a built-in down payment.

In addition, automakers are stepping in to soften the blow with their own perks like the Ford Power Promise. If you buy or lease any Ford electric vehicle, Ford will include a top-tier complimentary home charger and standard installation. That program changes on September 30.

Ford provides 24/7 support and easy charging on the go with the Blue Oval Charge Network. And you can have confidence with Ford’s battery and drive systems, which are covered for 8 years or 100,000 miles.

In terms of on-the-road charging, Ford EVs have compatible functionality to charge virtually anywhere, including at Electrify America and Tesla Supercharger stations.

“Driving one of these means no more trips to the gas station. A full charge at home for me costs about $7,” said Jolly. “That alone saves me close to $2,000 a year in fuel. Maintenance costs drop too. No oil changes.”

For those interested in leasing, Jolly confirmed that incentives apply for the full lease term, not just until September 30.

Jolly says Ford has seen EV sales skyrocket in August, as buyers rush to beat the tax credit, rebate and incentive deadline. And September represents a last-chance window to save thousands on going electric.

Have the tax incentives for electric vehicles worked?
So we might want an ongoing incentive to push people into buying electric vehicles.
What happens now that the federal incentives are ending?
They have also eliminated penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which require automakers to sell more fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles.","Electric vehicle sales in the United States are setting records. Over the past two months, consumers across the country have been rushing to car dealerships to buy EVs before a federal incentive providing up to $7,500 in tax credits ends Sept. 30.

In July, automakers sold more than 130,000 EVs, about 25% more than the month before. That number reached an all-time high in August, with about 12% of all new cars sold being electric.

The federal government rolled out current EV tax incentives in 2008, aiming to bridge the price difference between gasoline and electric cars. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act modified the policy by adding income caps for those eligible to receive the tax break and limiting the credit to EVs under a certain price. To qualify, vehicles also must be built in the United States using domestically sourced materials. This policy was set to run through 2032.

But in July, Congress approved the tax and spending legislation colloquially known as the Big Beautiful Bill, scrapping the discount seven years before its original expiration date.

“The move is broadly reflective of the government not wanting to promote electric vehicle adoption or environmental policy more generally,” said Stephanie Weber, assistant professor in the Department of Economics, noting that several other pro-EV policies have already been eliminated.

As the program comes to an end, CU Boulder Today sat down with Weber, who is also a fellow at the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute, to discuss the impact federal incentives had and the outlook for electric cars.

Have the tax incentives for electric vehicles worked?

There’s evidence that a meaningful share, from 10% to 30%, of the EVs that were being sold were purchased because of the incentives.

Over the past 15 years, the types of products automakers offer in the United States have also improved. For example, we now have EVs with larger batteries that have more range before they need to be charged. We can attribute some of those improvements to the incentives. They motivate automakers to develop new products, knowing there’s this enhanced demand for EVs.

The current tax credit policy for EVs was set to expire in 2032. Doesn't that mean the government was going to phase out the incentives anyway?

The subsidies were always intended to be phased out. But from an economic perspective, some should maybe persist.

Economically, we want to use these incentives to solve what are called market failures—basically anything that causes us to deviate from efficient outcomes under a free market. In the case of vehicles, the major market failures are environmental impacts from gasoline vehicles, from local air pollution to greenhouse gas emissions.

Consumers, when they buy a car, don't necessarily have an incentive to consider the pollution impacts on other people. So we might want an ongoing incentive to push people into buying electric vehicles.

What happens now that the federal incentives are ending?

In the immediate term, we're seeing really big increases in electric vehicle adoption, because people want to make the purchase before the tax credit expires.

Over time, we will see a reduction in sales relative to what we’d see under the policy. It may not be an absolute decline in sales, although that's also possible, but it might be a flattening out in growth. Some estimates suggest that between 2026 and 2028, about 4% of new vehicles sold will be EVs, about half the current share, due to these policy changes.

How is this policy change affecting automakers?

We are going to see fewer new products than we might have otherwise. Some automakers have actually canceled EV models that they had previously announced. For example, Honda canceled plans for a large electric SUV in July, anticipating a decrease in U.S. demand. General Motors and Volkswagen have announced that they’re scaling back EV production. They are also going to spend less money trying to develop new electric vehicles and trying to improve the technology in the United States.

And it’s not just the tax credits that are getting taken away. There are other incentives on the automaker side for promoting EVs and fuel-efficient vehicles. Many of those have also been eliminated in the last year.

One was a waiver that allowed California to set its own vehicle emission rules, which were stricter than federal standards. The state mandated that a certain percent of new cars sold in California be zero-emission, ramping up to all new cars by 2035, and 11 other states, including Colorado, adopted California’s standards. They have also eliminated penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which require automakers to sell more fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles.

What would be a better long-term policy than EV subsidies?

EV subsidies, as we've been doing them, are not the optimal policy, partly because these subsidies tend to disproportionately benefit wealthier people who can afford new vehicles.

From an economic standpoint, an effective environmental policy should align people's private incentives with societal incentives. So in this case, we would want to directly make it more expensive to generate pollution, through ways like putting a surcharge on gasoline.

Such a policy can have impacts beyond car-buying behaviors too. It would also make people consider things like, “Should I drive to the grocery store, or is this actually a small trip that I can make via the bus or bike?” and reduce their emissions that way. An EV subsidy isn't going to do that.",https://www.colorado.edu/today/sites/default/files/2025-09/andrew-roberts-2JvEjF0tf50-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 17:02:07.386128

The most significant change is the elimination of the Five Percent Safe Harbor for all wind and solar projects more than 1.5 megawatts.
This requirement for the ""performance"" of physical work is a departure from the prior guidance, where physical work only needed to have ""begun.""
We expect compliance with the Physical Work Test to be the subject of increased diligence by tax equity investors and lenders, as well as the subject of IRS audits.","In a decision that could make it challenging for wind and solar projects to qualify for the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released Notice 2025-42 on August 15, 2025, which eliminates the ""Five Percent Safe Harbor"" option to establish ""beginning of construction"" for certain renewable energy projects.

Under the updated guidance, these projects can only use the Physical Work Test to establish a ""beginning construction"" date under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Additionally, taxpayers who wish to claim a wind or solar ITC or PTC that avoids the new December 31, 2027, placed-in-service date requirement must begin construction by performing on-site or off-site physical work before July 4, 2026.

The New Rules

Notice 2025-42 is effective for wind and solar projects that begin construction after September 2, 2025, and before July 4, 2026. Developers will have four calendar years to place the facility into service after construction officially commences. Any developers needing an extension for construction lasting beyond four years will have to demonstrate ""continuous construction"" as opposed to merely demonstrating continuous efforts. Projects that start after July 4, 2026, must be completed by the end of 2027.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax credits for wind and solar projects are subject to earlier phaseouts compared to other renewable energy technologies. For those wind and solar projects seeking to qualify for the ""technology-neutral credits"" under Code Sections 45Y and 48E (i.e., projects with a begin of construction date after December 31, 2024, but before July 4, 2026), the new guidance under Notice 2025-42 now controls the requirements for what constitutes a project's beginning of construction. However, projects that have begun construction by September 2, 2025, may still rely on guidance contained in numerous notices previously issued by the Department of the Treasury.

The most significant change is the elimination of the Five Percent Safe Harbor for all wind and solar projects more than 1.5 megawatts. Previously, developers were permitted to expend five percent or more of a project's total cost to establish that construction had begun on a facility. Under the new guidance, there must be specifically documented on-site or off-site physical work being conducted to establish the beginning of construction, rather than mere economic investment. This requirement for the ""performance"" of physical work is a departure from the prior guidance, where physical work only needed to have ""begun."" Distributed solar developers, with projects whose nameplate capacities do not exceed 1.5 megawatts, will still be permitted to rely on the Five Percent Test.

Meeting New Regulations

Unless subject to the Five Percent Test, it is critical that wind and solar project developers demonstrate compliance with the Physical Work Test by documenting progress through pictures, emails, invoices, government permits, and similar records. We expect compliance with the Physical Work Test to be the subject of increased diligence by tax equity investors and lenders, as well as the subject of IRS audits.",https://www.bakerdonelson.com/images/_wbmanaged/screenshot2025-09-09155310_wbc_socialimage_163227.png,N,,2025-09-12 04:58:17.685157

In a typical solar grazing arrangement, sheep farmers (called grazers) are paid by solar developers to bring the animals to sites hosting large arrays — often farms — where they munch away on the vegetation.
It can do damage to the panels.” Solar grazing goats, meanwhile, has been ​“a disaster,” Anderson said, because they chew wires and other parts of solar arrays.
In climates like Illinois’, sheep must be housed and fed inside during winter — a considerable expense.
​“There may be a real advantage in having the Illinois Solar Lamb label.”","To all the challenges the solar industry is facing today, add one more: cultivating a domestic market for lamb meat. It may seem an unlikely mission for clean-energy developers, but in many states, including Illinois, grazing sheep between rows of photovoltaic panels is considered the most efficient form of agrivoltaics — the combination of solar and farming on the same land.

Solar advocates, researchers, and developers have given much attention to agrivoltaics. The practice includes growing crops like blueberries, tomatoes, or peppers in the shade of solar panels and letting cows or sheep graze around the arrays.

Perhaps the biggest benefit of agrivoltaics is that land is not being taken out of agricultural production in favor of clean energy, a concern that has stoked intense opposition to solar. The Trump administration codified this sentiment when the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on Aug. 19 that the agency ​“will no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland.”

Illinois’ sprawling fields of corn and soybeans don’t coexist well with solar panels, but sheep do, making grazing a promising type of agrivoltaics for the state, proponents say.

In a typical solar grazing arrangement, sheep farmers (called grazers) are paid by solar developers to bring the animals to sites hosting large arrays — often farms — where they munch away on the vegetation. Meanwhile, the landowner benefits from lease payments. Grazing is a lower-emissions alternative to mechanical mowing, and sheep can reach corners that mowers can’t.

But to make a living herding sheep, the grazers need to be able to sell the lambs they raise as meat. In the U.S., lamb is sold primarily in halal markets and appears on menus only during Easter holidays. Three-quarters of that meat is imported from Australia and New Zealand.

“What there needs to be, honestly, is more demand for lamb in the country,” said Stacie Peterson, executive director of the American Solar Grazing Association, which offers solar grazing certifications and contract templates. ​“We’re hoping to help develop more breeding stock, more farmers, more grazers doing this.”

A taste for lamb

Brooke Watson would like to see demand for lamb soar in the Midwest, in tandem with demand for solar grazing. Brooke’s husband, Chauncey Watson IV, has been raising sheep since he was in 4-H, a program that teaches kids about agriculture. Chauncey’s family has farmed in Illinois since 1856. The couple has raised lambs and sheep for wool, but in 2023 they bought a new flock of ​“hair sheep,” which don’t need shearing, to give solar grazing a try. ​“Hooves on the ground” happened last summer, Brooke said. Now they have 500 ewes grazing on over 320 acres at nine community solar sites in six Illinois counties.

Brooke laments that Americans ​“lost their taste for lamb” after World War II — because veterans had grown tired of wartime canned lamb rations, according to some accounts. (Other historical factors also likely influenced the decline in mutton’s popularity.)

“It has picked up in the last few decades, but more so with immigrant communities, where lamb is that really valuable cultural and religious product,” she said, adding that ​“traditional beef and chicken consumers” should give lamb a chance. ​“There’s really a huge, huge potential for both of these industries to grow and evolve together side by side.”

Brooke said solar grazing can also provide a way for younger farmers to stay in the business.

“The landowner most typically is hitting retirement age, and they don’t want to work the land anymore. So solar is a way for them to still maintain ownership of that parcel, and they’re compensated to host the solar on the site” while collaborating with farmers like her and her husband, who are typically ​“younger, maybe first generation or newer farmers, and they’re excited about the sheep grazing.”

A novelty in Illinois

According to a census by the American Solar Grazing Association and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, sheep solar grazing is concentrated in the West and the South. In 2024, almost 62,000 sheep were grazing over 87,000 acres at 109 solar sites in the South, with more than half of the animals in Texas. In the Midwest, including Illinois, just over 13,000 sheep grazed almost 7,000 acres of solar at 148 sites.

Texas and California have long histories of shepherding, and in many areas sheep are central to the ranching culture. That means grazing sheep under solar panels is continuing these areas’ traditional agriculture.

But in Illinois, there is little history of raising sheep. So converting acres of the state’s primary corn and soybean fields may still raise eyebrows.

“In Europe, solar grazing has taken off, but they are much more into sheep,” said Ken Anderson, director of the Advanced Energy Institute at Southern Illinois University. ​“When you see sheep move into Illinois, it’s unfamiliar to people; they’re not used to seeing sheep. It’s better with cattle, but cattle are harder — they like to scratch. It can do damage to the panels.”

Solar grazing goats, meanwhile, has been ​“a disaster,” Anderson said, because they chew wires and other parts of solar arrays. He is working on a proposed agrivoltaics research site that would grow peaches, apples, and other specialty crops amid solar panels on a former military munitions site in Illinois. Anderson prefers growing crops under panels to grazing, but crops need more specialized solar configurations.

Solar panels suited for sheep are ​“strictly industrial arrays,” he said. ​“All you’re going to be able to do is graze sheep there in the future, so you need to think about the long haul.”

Sheep may be the state’s best option for large arrays because, Anderson thinks, there’s limited potential for solar panels to occupy the same land as the state’s traditional sprawling corn and soybean fields.

“In my opinion, the economics will never work,” for pairing corn and soy with solar, Anderson said. ​“When you grow broad-acreage crops like corn and soy, you use very large equipment, so you have to put the panels far apart,” resulting in less energy output.

While solar grazing in Illinois might often replace corn or soybean production, Watson sees it as a positive trade-off.

“So much of that corn is used for ethanol production, and so much of that soy is, quite frankly, exported to other countries,” she said. ​“So we really look at solar grazing as an opportunity to have more U.S.-sourced energy production and food production as well.”

The Watsons work with a solar developer called Pivot Energy. Since 2021, agrivoltaics has been the company’s main focus, according to director of operations and maintenance Angie Burke. In Illinois, Pivot Energy has 365 sheep grazing at 11 sites, and those numbers are projected to more than double by next year.

“Agrivoltaics is this great way to support those family farmers locally and provide that cost-competitive, locally sourced, and high-protein-value food for those communities that are excited to eat more lamb,” Burke said.

Improving the land

While solar grazing may not be more profitable than mechanical mowing for landowners, it leaves the soil in better condition than if it were left idle under the panels.

“Let’s be delicate — [the sheep] are contributing to the soil” with their excrement, said Anderson.

In climates like Illinois’, sheep must be housed and fed inside during winter — a considerable expense. But Brooke Watson noted that, unlike solar grazers in Western states, she and her husband don’t need to provide much water for sheep in summer, as the lush vegetation and frequent rain suffice. In any state, solar grazing means ensuring that there are safe fences or wires around sites and that predators are kept out.

“In the early days, there were some horror stories where people dropped sheep off and came back at the end of the summer and there weren’t any sheep anymore,” said Ethan Winter, national smart solar director of American Farmland Trust, an organization committed to farmland preservation and sustainable farming practices. ​“You’re starting to see more professionalization, more formalized best practices for grazers.”

American Farmland Trust’s Midwest solar specialist Alan Bailey noted that existing crop residue or debris must be cleared and specific cover crops planted to prepare for solar grazing, but this can happen while an array is being built. ​“One of our principles is having some sort of living cover on those sites throughout the entire construction process,” he said.

“There’s both the need and opportunity to think about markets for the lamb,” Winter said, noting that the animals could be sold to wholesale processors or marketed locally. ​“There may be a real advantage in having the Illinois Solar Lamb label.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/250610_NATHAN-HELEINE_PIVOT-SOLAR-187-Final.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7b6bbc80d6790336a7978ed42aac7c35,N,,2025-09-11 17:02:21.793493

Iowa utilities still have a “long way to go” to meet a 2035 net zero emissions goal, especially as changes at the federal level have accelerated the timelines for key wind and solar tax credits, according to the 2025 Iowa Electric Generation Condition of the State report.

The annual report from Iowa Environmental Council said in order to meet this net zero goal, utilities not only have to transition away from coal but also continue to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 30%-60% over the next 20 years.

The net zero goal is consistent with federal goals from 2021 that directed the energy sector to achieve net zero emissions, or emissions that are equal to the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere, by 2035.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change similarly found in 2022 that global greenhouse gas emissions must reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change, including limiting global temperature increases.

Steve Guyer, IEC’s energy policy counsel, said in a webinar Wednesday about the report that climate change costs Iowa businesses, families, governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year.

“I want us to keep in mind that energy, the environment and the economy are actually inextricably linked,” Guyer said.

Guyer, and the report, said coal generation which has the greatest greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, not only “drives climate change” but also has negative effects on public health, creates air pollution, can cause premature death and can even impact corn yields.

“Air pollution does not discriminate,” Guyer said. “Everybody has to suffer, and is burdened by, basically, this impact – not only financially, but otherwise.”

Coal down, wind and solar up

In Iowa, the share of coal-based electric generation has declined consistently since 2010, according to the report. From 2021 to 2024, fossil fuel generation decreased by 9% in the state.

The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019. In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.

Solar increased in 2024 to represent 1% of the share of electricity generation. According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.

“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said. “That places us certainly ahead of any other state as far as the percent of generation from renewables. It also means that we are uniquely positioned to actually achieve 100% carbon free by 2035.”

Geoff Greenwood, the media relations manager for one of Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa’s status as a leader in clean energy is “in large part because of MidAmerican Energy’s clean energy leadership.”

Wind makes up the majority, or 64%, of MidAmerica’s energy mix. Greenwood said in an email that since 2004, the company has invested in more than 7,600 megawatts of wind and 141 MW of solar, and has plans to invest in hundreds more by 2028. According to the company’s website, it delivered “the equivalent of 100% carbon-free energy” to Iowa customers in 2024.

“The environmental benefits of renewable generation are not diminished by the timing of its production—each and every megawatt of clean energy MidAmerican generates contributes to overall emissions reductions and supports our customers’ sustainability goals and Iowa’s leadership in clean energy,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican has made, and continues to make, significant, measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading Iowa’s electric sector in decarbonization efforts.”

The report points out that despite the significant share of wind and solar generation in the state and commitments from MidAmerican and Alliant Energy, to achieve net zero emissions, Iowa has six operational fossil-fuel power plants.

According to the report these plants emitted more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024, along with several thousand tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

Power plants represent about 16% of Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The report shows that agriculture at 29% accounts for the largest share of emissions in the state, closely followed by residential, commercial and industrial fossil fuel use.

Greenwood said MidAmerican has already retired “several coal units” and “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” He noted the existing plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations.

Coal generation in Iowa is nearly 52% lower in 2024 than it was in 2005, and carbon emissions have decreased by 47% in the same time, according to Greenwood.

“The Council’s report itself acknowledges that the electric sector is the only sector in Iowa that has made meaningful progress in reducing GHG emissions,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican is proud to be a key contributor to that progress.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said in an email the company is implementing a strategic plan to “create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities.”

Alliant plans to, by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utility operations to 50% of 2005 levels, and to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040.

According to the spokesperson, the company reduced its 2005 emission levels by 39% in 2024.

“We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our goals remain the same, however, increasing customer energy needs, reliability and resource adequacy requirements and tax policy changes may result in delays in achieving, or revisions to, our goals.”

‘Staggering’ increases in energy needs projected

Guyer said energy demand is increasing rapidly, in part due to the implementation of data centers.

According to the report, which analyzed modeling projections from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO power pool, Iowa has a projected load growth of between 30% and 60% over the next 20 years.

Guyer said that projected load, plus a change in MISO’s rules as to what can count towards a utility’s accredited capacity, means there is a “staggering” amount of energy that will be required in the next 20 years.

“We have a, I’ll just say, a staggering mission ahead of us,” Guyer said. “Not only do we have to try and achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but we have to try and do that while we’re also trying to meet this increase in demand.”

Greenwood said the “exponentially” growing demand for energy noted in the report, means that “a dependable supply during this growth is critical.”

“Our long-term vision remains clear: we are striving to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the reliability our customers expect,” Greenwood said. “It’s crucial that our energy transition balances reliability and affordability with environmental responsibility. Reliable electricity is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”

‘Big beautiful’ law changes timeline for tax credits

Guyer said utilities need to “aggressively move” to make use of the wind and solar credits made available under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.

The massive, Republican-led tax incentive and spending bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” which was signed into law in July, shrinks the timeline for these credits.

Now, to be eligible for the credits, projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be placed in service before 2028, according to the report.

“Even though there was an urgency back with the IRA, that has been exponentially increased now due to the big, beautiful bill,” Guyer said.

But, Guyer said, whether a company can make use of IRA credits or not, renewable energy projects are still the cheapest forms of electric generation in Iowa.

“Even without the credit, the renewable generation will still be lower cost, but the credit certainly will have an impact and help customers overall,” Guyer said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/turbinesatsunset-2048x1274-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 16:01:08.667693

Six months later, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a recommendation to rescind the “endangerment finding”—a result of a 2007 Supreme Court case—which argued that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare in the United States and therefore are subject to direct regulation by EPA under the Clean Air Act.

These two actions, though playing out on different political stages, are connected in more ways than meet the eye.

For international climate policy—where the Paris Agreement remains the primary framework to structure international cooperation—actions taken in one country can send a signal to other countries and thereby affect global climate policy momentum. This is the underlying logic of the process in which all parties to the Paris Agreement submit pledges, called nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) every five years. The pledges are then collectively assessed by all parties to the Paris Agreement and updated every five years.

The immediate magnitude of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (which formally takes effect in January 2026) can be measured by the country’s substantial share of global emissions. But even US domestic policy is more influential globally than its proportional contributions to emissions. The endangerment finding underpins several US federal regulations targeting greenhouse gas emissions; for example, EPA standards regulating power plant carbon pollution and the fuel economy of passenger cars. Without the endangerment finding, the legal basis for these climate policies disappears.

By eliminating a legal foundation for US domestic policy, the United States is inviting other nations to revisit their own internal policies. Indeed, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, in an editorial for the Economist, referred to the previous administration’s climate policies as “a regulatory assault aimed at eliminating hydrocarbons” while inviting other countries to mirror the United States and prioritize “energy addition, not subtraction.”

The United States is therefore no longer just critical of international climate policy agreements, but also increasingly of climate action more broadly. These changing attitudes may be influencing other countries to reconsider their Paris commitments, too.

All greenhouse gas emissions matter, but large countries’ emissions matter most.

The potential impact on global climate policy momentum leads to questions about the federal government’s assertion that US greenhouse gas emissions have limited influence on the global climate.

In the documentation supporting the endangerment finding rescission, EPA states that “reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all vehicles and engines in the United States to zero would not have a scientifically measurable impact on greenhouse gas emission concentrations or global warming potential.” This statement is dubious on its face: according to EPA, 29 percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation, of which more than three quarters are from road vehicles. These road vehicles alone emit over a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, exceeding the total annual greenhouse gases of all but a handful of countries, each with their own obligations under the Paris Agreement.

EPA’s statement ignores the political dynamics inherent to global climate policy, which requires all emitters to cooperate for the greater good. Individual countries can contribute only a minor share toward the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The United States emits 11 percent of greenhouse gases today, second only to China with 30 percent of global emissions, and followed by India and the European Union with 8 percent and 6 percent of global emissions each. The other 45 percent of global emissions are shared among the more than 160 other countries of the world.

Thus, a free-rider issue extends through global climate policy. Countries bear high costs to decarbonize, but the benefits are shared by all countries. At the same time, individual climate action without buy-in from the rest of the world not only limits benefits to the mitigating country, but potentially puts the proactive country at a competitive disadvantage if the costs of mitigation increase the prices of export goods.

Breaking the free-rider problem has driven decades of multilateral climate policy cooperation—culminating in the Paris Agreement.

The United States influences climate policy momentum.

While the United States leaving the Paris Agreement once more is a blow for global climate policy, the “Paris structure” can in principle withstand countries abandoning or downscaling their climate policy pledges; it was never likely that 200 countries would always be on the same page. But in the pledge-and-review process of the Paris Agreement, the NDCs of large economies are particularly important: an NDC perceived as ambitious might spur other countries to strengthen their own pledges, while pledges perceived as being comparatively modest would see such peer pressure diminished. On top of that, the actual commitments of NDCs, and especially their implementation, could support climate action abroad in terms of financing, clean technology costs, and other spillovers.

Even though the rest of the world continued to implement climate policy after the first US withdrawal under the first Trump administration, more severe spillovers may ensue this time. The United States elected President Donald J. Trump again, when his stance toward climate change was more well known and strident. This repeated US reticence on climate policy leads to a persistent credible commitment problem.

Other countries will be asking if the regulatory repeals can withstand court challenges and how easily a more pro-climate administration could reinstate both the endangerment finding and related regulations. Such uncertainty could affect the ambition of other governments.

In the past, US actions could be interpreted as disagreement with the legal form of an international agreement (concerns sometimes shared by other countries). But now, the United States appears to have shifted toward hostility, exacerbating the free-rider problem inherent to climate policy. The United States’ actions could move countries to believe that their domestic actions are in vain if the rest of the world does not follow. A self-fulfilling prophecy might ensue.

It is against this background that the repeal of the endangerment finding, and especially the repeal of associated federal climate policy regulations, could reverberate through the international community. The Paris architecture can deal with any country—even the world’s largest historical emitter—stepping in and out of the agreement. But actions that make it harder for future US governments to enact climate policies would not go unnoticed and may over time lead to a negative multiplier effect.

Some anecdotal signs already indicate that other countries are reacting to the United States’ climate negativity with negativity of their own. Indonesia’s special envoy for climate stated in January that his own country might consider leaving the Paris Agreement, saying that it is unfair for Indonesia to commit to climate action if a large country like the United States abandons the agreement. Argentinian president Javier Milei likewise expressed his desire for Argentina to leave the Paris Agreement. In New Zealand, one of the government coalition partners raised the possibility of leaving the Paris Agreement after the next national election in 2026. In the European Union, a former climate commissioner warns against “green backsliding.”

Another impact of the US withdrawal from the international climate stage is felt in its foreign assistance. South Africa was counting on financial support from the United States to gradually decommission coal-fired power plants, which will no longer happen due to the United States also withdrawing from the Just Energy Transition Partnership that supports the energy transition in emerging economies. Stakeholders in India expressed concerns about ripple effects for green hydrogen development and capital to finance clean technology investments.

But evidence for any multiplier effect, positive and negative, will be found in future NDCs. As it happens, the 2025 COP30, hosted by Brazil, will be the first annual climate conference after the new round of NDC submissions are due. The deadline to submit the new NDCs was initially set for February 2025 but later extended to September 2025. So far, only about 20 parties have submitted NDCs. Missed deadlines in multilateral forums are not necessarily unusual, given that each party will be constrained by its own domestic political circumstances. But it remains to be seen how many NDCs will be submitted and how ambitious the pledges contained therein will be.

In contrast, for the COP26 in Glasgow, which took stock of the first set of NDCs, well over 100 parties submitted NDCs, with most having done so well in advance of the conference. This included the United States, as President Joe Biden reversed the decision to leave the Paris Agreement only a few months after the US withdrawal had taken effect but before COP26, which was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even after the 2024 US election, the Biden administration still submitted a revised NDC for 2035, committing to 61–66 percent emissions reductions by 2035, compared to 2005. This revised NDC could be seen as a signal of what a future administration committed to climate policy might want to achieve.

But if actions are now undertaken to constrain the future regulatory capabilities of the federal government, other countries might adjust their expectations of what the United States can achieve over the next decade. Expectations about the relative supply and costs of fossil fuels versus clean technologies could lead to other countries moderating their NDCs. For poorer economies, expectations of reduced international climate finance could reduce the willingness to adopt more ambitious pledges.

In the European Union, lack of momentum is also visible. The world’s second-largest economy traditionally sees itself as a frontrunner in climate action and has indeed legislated extensively to achieve its 2030 climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent compared to 1990. For 2040, its proposed target is a 90 percent emissions reduction compared to 1990. The European Council—the body representing the EU countries’ heads of government—so far has not formally agreed to this target, which means the European Union has delayed its NDC for 2035, which depends on its 2040 target. EU decisionmakers cite ongoing challenges to industrial competitiveness and high energy prices. But the knowledge that the world’s largest economy is unwilling to commit to further climate action does not help the case of those promoting climate action in Europe.

Perhaps the most critical NDC will be the one that the world’s largest emitter, China, submits. In its current NDC, its main target is to ensure that its greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2030. China moving toward an absolute emissions reduction target would send a signal to other emerging economies to consider similar carbon constraints. The absence of a new US NDC, however, will remove any peer pressure from its greatest geopolitical and economic rival to enhance its current ambition.

Speakers at the RE+ trade show have pointed to the immense load growth from data centres as an opportunity for energy storage development.

At the moment, given the budget reconciliation bill’s negative targeting of wind and solar energy, BESS is available for rapid deployment to, in theory, meet that load growth.

Hithium emphasised that in the AI era, data centres will need to balance energy transition while maintaining efficient operations.

However, intermittency and millisecond-level load fluctuations have presented a challenge for data centres, creating a need for long-duration energy storage (LDES).

Hithium noted that combining Li-ion and Na-ion enables “data centre operators to meet both base load and peak demands efficiently, without sacrificing reliability.” Meanwhile, “the dedicated lifetime assessment model for AIDC ESS further ensures precise degradation insights, longer and more reliable project lifespan guaranteed under highly dynamic workloads.”

The company also claimed that the AIDC ESS solution can reduce the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), improving the efficiency of AI power supply.

Hithium’s Na-Ion cell, N162 Ah, has a low levelised cost of storage (LCOS), with a wide temperature range and high thermal stability, with no fire or explosion during nail penetration and crush tests.

Recently, Hithium opened a 10GWh, 484,441-square-foot battery module and system factory in Mesquite, Texas. The company said the investment figure for the factory was close to US$200 million.

Storion secures first vanadium electrolyte customer

Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) joint venture from Stryten and Largo Clean Energy, Storion Energy, has secured its first customer for vanadium electrolyte from its continuous production line.

Storion established the production line with support from the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Manufacture of Advanced Key Energy Infrastructure Technologies (MAKE IT) prize, of US$5 million, which the company received in 2024.

The company says the MAKE IT funds have been critical to enabling Storion’s growth since its launch this February.

Largo Physical Vanadium, which owns the vanadium, will deliver 50MWh of electrolyte to TerraFlow Energy for a 9.6MW/48MWh VRFB installation in Bellville, Texas.

In July, TerraFlow signed a strategic supply agreement with Storion. Under the agreement, Storion will provide its vanadium electrolyte production and manufacturing abilities to scale TerraFlow’s skid-based architecture.

Speaking with Energy-Storage.news Premium in April, Travis Torrey, CTO of Storion, said of the company’s current market approach:

That leaves their 2030 forecast 7 percentage points below the current market consensus for global EV market penetration, as tracked by IHS Global Insight.
Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are likely to help fill the gap as battery EV sales slow.
Still Goldman Sachs Research expects the medium-term boost to operating margins will be greater than any short-term impairment costs.
While hybrids are getting a boost in the US market, China sales are driving the higher plug-in hybrid sales forecasts.","The pace of adoption for electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to slow as regulations shift, and hybrid vehicles stand to benefit, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Traditional automakers are set up for a significant boost in profits as a result.

“Global battery-electric vehicle penetration rates are likely to enter a period of decline outside certain regions, such as China,” Goldman Sachs Research analyst Kota Yuzawa writes in a report. “We think the shift in the direction of US environmental regulations will have a major positive earnings impact on traditional automakers.”

What is the forecast for EV market share?

Goldman Sachs Research now expects EVs to be 25% of global sales in 2030, down from a previous forecast of 28%. That leaves their 2030 forecast 7 percentage points below the current market consensus for global EV market penetration, as tracked by IHS Global Insight. The team also cut their projection for 2040 EV sales share to 52% from a previous forecast of 59%.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are likely to help fill the gap as battery EV sales slow. The researchers see a structural shift in the US market toward hybrids and cite updated strategies from manufacturers. Japanese and Korean makers, in particular, have announced plans to shift a significant part of their product lineup from internal combustion engines to hybrid drivetrains.

Profit margins for car makers to rise as hybrid sales increase

Margins in North America for major US and Asian automakers may increase by 2 to 3 percentage points, adding between $15 billion and $22 billion to earnings before taxes for a group of companies that had combined operating profits of about $52 billion in 2024, Yuzawa writes.

As mandates to sell low-margin EVs ease, traditional automakers can maximize profits by selling a mix of gasoline-powered vehicles and hybrids. Recent comments from several traditional automakers support this view.

“The strength of HEV sales even amid low gasoline prices testifies to the fact that consumers value not only fuel efficiency but also power performance,” Yuzawa writes. “We believe that the simultaneous downsizing of gasoline engines and increase in vehicle size in the US market has led to demand for HEVs with better acceleration.”

The research team raised its forecasts for HEV sales weightings to 12% of the global market in 2030 (up from 10% previously) and 9% in 2040 (from 5%). In addition, they see plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) getting 14% of the market in 2030 and 17% in 2040 (up from a previous forecast of 9% in 2040).

How have regulatory changes impacted the EV industry?

US lawmakers recently eliminated civil penalties for non-compliance with federal fuel economy rules. Automakers that failed to meet existing corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards from the 2022 model year onward are no longer expected to face fines.

Among other things, the legislation also set a September 30, 2025, expiration date for tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a new EV and $4,000 for a used EV. This credit was previously set to run through 2032.

US rule changes may result in impairment charges for some automakers as the credits they purchased for emissions compliance decline in value. The value of credits is set in negotiated transactions and is difficult to quantify based on publicly available information. Still Goldman Sachs Research expects the medium-term boost to operating margins will be greater than any short-term impairment costs.

In Europe, environmental regulations that affect EV sales are also being eased, though not to the same extent. The European Commission in March softened its stance on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions targets for 2025, giving automakers a three-year grace period that runs through 2027. The change is anticipated to help manufacturers to meet targets and avoid fines.

What is the EV market forecast for China?

Goldman Sachs Research’s revised global EV market penetration forecasts reflect reduced expectations for sales in the US, Europe, and Japan, but their forecasts for China and India are unchanged. Indeed, Global EV sales rose 21% to 1.16 million vehicles in June of this year. Sales volume in China increased 37% (year over year), while sales in the US and Europe declined 13% and 5%.

As such, EV and hybrid vehicle demand is regionally dependent. While hybrids are getting a boost in the US market, China sales are driving the higher plug-in hybrid sales forecasts.

The Iowa Environmental Council says it's possible for the state to meet higher demand and achieve the carbon-free electricity goal.

Renewable energy from wind and solar rose to 67% last year in Iowa, according to the IEC's latest Condition of the State report. But import taxes on materials, including a 50% tariff on steel, and a rollback on federal tax credits could dampen momentum.

""A wind turbine is almost all steel. And it'd be nice if all that steel was available here in the U.S., but it's not. So, as that steel is imported, that's certainly going to increase the cost of building that turbine,"" said Steve Guyer, IEC's senior energy policy counsel.

The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday it will hear a case challenging the legality of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Utility-scale wind and solar projects also face a severely shortened timeline for federal tax credits after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law this summer. Projects must begin construction before July of next year to qualify for subsidies.

""It's very possible that as we look at this rapid increase in demand, they may be viable even without those tax credits. But sort of crystal-balling this, it's sort of hard to tell what impact will really occur,"" Guyer said.

The IEC report and other research show the costs to build and maintain wind and solar are cheaper than coal and natural gas, even without subsidies.

Earlier this year, Alliant Energy and MidAmerican Energy proposed large-scale wind and solar projects.

Next, it’s time to put the decade of 1.5°C behind us.

A bit of history. Let’s go back to early 2015, a few months before the COP21 climate talks in Paris. Countries have agreed to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C but have not yet turned that figure into an emissions target. The UK – the most progressive economy in the developed world – was still targeting an 80% reduction under its pioneering 2008 Climate Change Act.

In June, the Group of Seven met in Schloss Elmau in Germany as guests of then German Chancellor Angela Merkel. When the closing communique appeared, it contained this bombshell: “We emphasize that deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are required, with a decarbonisation of the global economy over the course of this century.” [italics mine – M.L.].

The political enthronement of net zero had begun.

But the enthronement went too far. The Paris Agreement only promised to “hold the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels”. However, in order to secure support from the coalition of Small Island Developing States (as documented in a series of Cleaning Up episodes), it also included a commitment to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”.

This set in train a series of events, starting with the publication by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, of the SR15 report in October 2018, which documented for the first time the considerable climate impacts that could be avoided by remaining under 1.5°C. It also pointed out that keeping to 1.5°C would mean cutting emissions by 45% from a 2010 baseline by 2045 (around 50% from the 2018 figure) and reaching net zero by 2050.

These goals were immediately seized on by Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, the Sunrise Movement and other activists, who were having their moment in the spotlight. Net zero by 2050 was adopted by politicians, executives and investors in an orgy of virtue-signaling ahead of COP26 in Glasgow. How many of them spared a thought for how much it would cost?

Energy and transport assets can have lifetimes of 30 years or more. Reducing emissions by half in the 12 years after 2018 would mean writing off trillions of dollars in productive assets, the economic impact of which was not captured in the IPCC’s analysis. What its report did show, however, as long as you scrolled to page 152 of Chapter 2, was the impact on marginal carbon prices: In the 2°C scenario they could rise to $225 per metric ton of CO2 (in 2010 dollars) by 2030; under 1.5°C they could go as high as $6,050 per ton. That’s quite the difference.

Adopting the 1.5°C target, therefore, meant targeting the premature retirement of a large slice of existing energy assets and throwing money at anything with the slightest chance of reducing emissions. Is it surprising that so many people now associate climate action with a profligate waste of public money and an elite indifferent to energy bills?

The irony is that the world went mad for 1.5°C at almost exactly the moment it became clear it could not be achieved: My first public statements that 1.5°C was no longer achievable can be dated to 2018.

Today, it is ten years since that G-7 meeting in Schloss Elmau. We have either passed the 1.5°C threshold or will do so in the next few years – yet commitment to 1.5°C still serves as an article of faith for the climate community. That has to change.

It’s not that 1.5°C of warming won’t have devastating impacts – indeed, we are already seeing them. But that doesn’t make it a credible target. Continuing to adhere to it leads to terrible policy decisions and undermines public support. It’s time to switch back to the hard 2°C target that lies at the heart of the Paris Agreement.

Coda I. To avoid exceeding 2°C of warming we still need to reach net zero, only later. Advanced economies would still need to target 2050; China would still need to target 2060; India would still need to target 2070 – just as they all promised in Glasgow in 2021.

Coda II: If we all get to within 5% or 10% of our targets, that’s pretty good going. If it’s not enough, we can always course correct along the way (following what is called in the jargon an adaptive pathway), using technologies and wealth generated over the coming decades. The target should be net zero-ish, rather than absolute net zero.

3. Reset energy priorities

When it comes to energy, the pragmatic climate reset means focusing on decarbonizing the first 90% as quickly and affordably as possible, rather than letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.

On one level, decarbonization is simple: Clean up electricity, and electrify almost everything. All low-carbon pathways ever modeled have this approach at their heart.

We already know how to electrify huge additional swathes of the economy at modest or no cost: Land transport, domestic and commercial heating, low- to mid-temperature industrial heat, and those thermal processes that can switch to electrochemistry. We even know how to decarbonize high-temperature industrial heat using commercially available technologies, particularly if we are prepared to pay a modest carbon price.

The challenge. A lack of skills, immature supply chains, reluctance to change behavior, existing high-carbon assets, lags in capital formation, lobbying and regulatory capture. These are all things that get fixed with the passing of decades and generations.

As for decarbonization of electricity, we certainly already know how to do this. Every country in the world is already doing it, even those with no commitment to climate action.

A decade ago, coal provided 39% of US power. Last year it was 15%. In the European Union, coal was at 26%, and last year it was 10%. The UK was 42% dependent on coal in 2012 and last year closed its final power station. In China, coal was at 73% of power ten years ago, in the first quarter of 2025 it was 58%. China may still be building new power stations, but it is also shutting old ones and using the ones it has less and less.

Over that same decade, wind and solar generation have soared by a factor of 18 – making them the fastest-growing new source of electricity in history, by a wide margin. This quarter, wind and solar together will deliver 17% of global power. Nuclear is growing too, but much more slowly. The global solar industry now has enough capacity to manufacture 2 terawatts of panels per year and will soon be installing 1TW annually – enough to replace 10% of fossil-based power.

The multi-decadal decline in solar and wind costs, only briefly interrupted by the recent spike in inflation, has resumed. Costs are below those of new-built coal or gas plants practically everywhere, and in many places below the cost of running existing plants.

Last year saw around 1 terawatt-hour of batteries manufactured, up by a factor of 26 over the past decade. To put this in context, 1TWh is enough to meet global power needs for around half an hour; models show that four hours of storage is enough for most grids to ride through most daily variations in supply and demand. EV batteries are increasingly being used to provide flexibility, and grid-connected storage is increasingly co-located with renewable generation. Ten more years of battery growth and the grid will be a completely different animal.

The main remaining challenges to complete decarbonization of the grid will be industry, seasonality and longer-duration resilience.

In countries with good resources, a combination of renewables with batteries will soon deliver dispatchable power more cheaply and reliably than coal or natural gas, so that’s a big chunk of industry sorted. Very sunny regions can already have power from solar and batteries 97% of the time at $104/MWh, down 22% from last year, according to estimates from think tank Ember. And Abu Dhabi is building the first GW of baseload solar in the world. Seasonality will most likely end up being solved by overbuilding (as happens in every other sector of transport, energy, infrastructure and the built environment).

This tide of cheap clean electricity is unstoppable. In the 11th century, after his failed attempt to stop the waters, King Canute declared that “all the inhabitants of the world should know that the power of kings is vain and trivial.” President Trump his Energy Secretary Chris Wright should take note.

Then there is gas.

Then there is gas. In 2022, Trieu Mai and some of his colleagues at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) showed that the cost of decarbonizing 90% of U.S. electricity would be around $125 per ton of CO2 (in 2022 dollars). After that it gets expensive, reaching $1,000 or more per ton to get to 100%. Similar results have been found for many other geographies including the UK, Germany and Australia.

I used to reject the idea of gas as a “transition fuel”. I was wrong.

If you simply replace big inflexible coal plants with big inflexible gas plants, you achieve an immediate halving of emissions, as the gas industry is fond of pointing out. The problem is, you are then locked in for the life of that plant and – given the scale of the infrastructure serving it – perhaps forever.

However, if you replace inflexible coal plants with flexible gas then, as long as regulation makes owners indifferent to the number of hours of operation, there’s no such lock-in. You might start with the flexible generation meeting 25% of the grid’s output, but as you continue to add very cheap wind, solar, demand response and batteries – and nuclear if you can get the numbers to work (see Part I for why I’m skeptical) – you can continue to push down gas use until your grid is 90% or more decarbonized. In fact, modelling shows that grids could keep going all the way to below 5% flexible generation before it becomes impossible to ride through periods of low renewable resources.

There is an additional benefit of leaving flexible gas capacity on the system: It can also help with grid stability.

The power cut that hit Spain and Portugal on April 28 was not caused by renewables. In fact, those who seize on power cuts (most recently Spain, but the UK, Australia, Texas, California, Chile and so on before then) as proof that grids must be based on fossil or nuclear power for stability, have been wrong every time.

Spain’s headlong rush to wind and solar, which were meeting 64% of demand at the moment of failure, had certainly reduced the amount of inertia on the system, but the issue that brought the grid down was the arcana of voltage oscillations. The fact is, Spain’s grid codes – the rules by which market participants feed in or draw out power – had not kept up with the rapidly-changing power mix; there was a culture of non-compliance by market participants; and too much was being asked of a weak interconnection to France.

It is perfectly feasible for renewable resources and batteries to provide grid stability services, and we should expect them to do so. Still, flexible gas capacity can help too, even at times when it is no longer needed to generate power. Engines and turbines can be decoupled from generators, leaving them spinning but neither consuming nor generating power. Then, when grid frequency changes, they provide inertia. They can also provide reactive power, short-circuit current, black-start capability and a range of other stability services.

Unlike a system that provides all grid stability services with only renewables and batteries, one with flexible gas generation can also ride through longer renewable outages at an affordable cost.

If society decides, at some later point, that we need to go all the way to a 100% decarbonized grid, we will face a well-defined challenge: How to replace a few percent of flexible gas generation (and the associated stability services).

Whatever route we choose, those last few percent would require vast investment and incur high running costs. It may be that by then we are so wealthy, and the impact of climate change so obvious, that we decide to spend the money. But it may be that we decide instead to do carbon removal, or to help laggard regions first. Or maybe we will have other priorities, like defense, or adaptation.

The fact is, how to decarbonize the last few percent of the grid is simply not a question we need to answer today.

Coda: Some sectors, of course, cannot be decarbonized via electrification – shipping, aviation, process emissions from cement, and the like. However, these account for less than 15% of emissions, and even here a pragmatic climate reset means focusing on rapid and cheap progress, not technological purity. 40% of shipping goes away if we stop shipping coal and oil around the world. For the rest, LNG, biogas and streamlined operations can reduce emissions far more rapidly than ammonia or synthetic methanol. Aviation emissions can be slashed via more efficient planes, improved operations, biofuels, contrail management and carbon removal, supported by appropriate taxation and the removal of subsidies. Industrial heat can be substantially decarbonized before tackling process emissions, which we will eventually eliminate via carbon capture and storage. We could finally get serious about plastics recycling or just accept that putting plastic waste in a well-managed landfill is a form of carbon sequestration. And so on.

4. Reset hydrogen

Hydrogen needs a reset all of its own. In all my decades as an analyst, I have never seen such a big disconnect between the physics of what a solution can deliver, and the politics of what’s being asked of it.

Why does this matter? Because if you wanted to delay the transition you would promote a solution that sounds perfect but doesn’t work. A fuel that is ubiquitous, easy to make, produces only water, will get cheaper and cheaper, provides jobs and photo-opportunities and solves every problem from cars to rockets, transport to fertilizer and steel to seasonal storage. Whoopee! And hydrogen even has an extra feature: It takes years and years to figure out that it is unaffordable – particularly if you can get the public to ignore 50 years of wasted public funds.

The hydrogen soufflé is beginning to deflate. At the end of last year, the European Court of Auditors found that the targets in the EU’s 2020 Hydrogen Strategy were “driven by political will rather than being based on robust analyses”, and called for a “reality check”. In January this year, France’s state auditor, the Cour de Comptes, estimated the country’s hydrogen strategy implies a cost of carbon of at least €520, and even jeopardizes France’s national finances.

But it’s time to go all in on the hydrogen reset. It is time to admit that green hydrogen will play no more than a bit part in a future low-carbon energy system.

It’s not just that green hydrogen is currently expensive to produce. It’s that it has no plausible pathway to affordability. Electrolyzer stacks will exhibit the same sort of learning rates as solar PV and batteries, but they are responsible for only around 10% of the cost of green hydrogen. Another 40% is electricity, and 40% is heavy engineering – electrical, chemical and civil – and their costs are not about to drop by the five to ten times required to make green hydrogen cheaper than other clean solutions.

You also have to add the cost of compression, transport, distribution, use and safety management. Even if your plan is to make ammonia locally from cheap wind or solar, or to feed hydrogen into a refinery, you either have to add the costs of batteries to smooth your power supply, or the cost of compression and buffer storage to meet the 24/7/365 demands of the downstream plant. If you are exporting, you’ll need pipelines and deep-water port infrastructure.

Green ammonia? It could perhaps eventually be viable, but only where dispatchable green power is very cheap, natural gas is very expensive and there’s a local market for fertilizer (Brazil, China and India come to mind). Elsewhere, the numbers simply don’t stack up, not even for Saudi Arabia’s NEOM mega-project.

Green steel? Simply not urgent. Switch primary iron production to natural gas direct reduction and you get 75% of the benefit at a fraction of the cost. We should keep working on direct electrical reduction and bio-coking coal, which promise to be cheaper and more flexible in terms of ore grades than hydrogen.

E-fuels? No way will they ever be cheap enough to replace petrol or diesel or to compete with electrification. It’s obvious, really, because you can’t make something from electricity which is cheaper than electricity. Germany needs to stop the charade of Technologieoffenheit (technology openness) before it witnesses the implosion of its entire automotive industry.

Hydrogen aviation? It’s a dead parrot, as even Airbus seems to have understood. Building the plane is not the problem (though it would carry half the passengers because it’s full of hydrogen and insulation) but there is no plausible way of getting liquid hydrogen to major airports at the required scale to run an airline.

What about sustainable airline fuel made from hydrogen with captured carbon, or so-called e-SAF? According to the EU’s own figures, it currently costs 12 times more than jet-fuel. And, since it is made in chemicals plants with electricity as the feedstock, there is no plausible pathway to an order-of-magnitude cost reduction.

Blending hydrogen into the grid? I have called this the stupidest idea from Stupidville, and I can’t improve on that. You are making a chemical feedstock for €6 – €10/kg, and then instantly reducing its heat value of less than €2/kg, while driving up costs to all other gas users, and committing to a pathway that cannot get beyond 6% decarbonization without building a new pipeline network. It beggars belief that this is being supported by governments – a gross failure of public policy.

White (geological) hydrogen? At this point it its an interesting field for scientific research. It certainly exists, but probably can’t be extracted at a meaningful flow rate. Even if it can, unless it can be extracted at high purity it’s just slightly lower-carbon natural gas. If the resource isn’t big enough to last 40 years you can’t build a pipeline to get it to the point of demand, and if it won’t last 20 years you can’t even build a local fertilizer plant. Wishful thinking is not an energy strategy.

We need to decarbonize 100 million tons of current hydrogen demand, which causes around 2.3% of global emissions. Since green hydrogen will always cost at least $2/kg more than fossil-based hydrogen, that means finding $200 billion per year of additional money – equivalent to the entire global aid budget. And since you need 15-year offtake agreements to secure project finance, you are looking for $3 trillion of up-front, bankable support. That’s three orders of magnitude more than anything available today.

The only affordable approach to decarbonizing current use cases is by means of hydrogen from natural gas, with the carbon captured and sequestered. Of course we have to do it right: Limiting fugitive methane emissions to less than 0.2% and achieving 95% or more capture and carbon sequestration. Society needs to demand that producers meet these stringent targets, instead of falling for activist claims that they are physically unachievable.

Coda: Luckily, there’s a silver lining to the inevitable failure of green hydrogen – it will be a relief for the planet. Every wind and solar project developer has to decide whether to sell electricity or make hydrogen. Until such time as the world is awash with green electricity (or pink, from nuclear, for that matter), every kilowatt-hour used to make hydrogen could deliver two to nine times the emission reductions if used directly, at a fraction of the cost. So that is what the pragmatic climate reset demands we do.

5. Reset diplomacy

In November 2011, I wrote a piece for BloombergNEF called Ya Basta! Time to Call Time On The COP Show. My argument was that the failure of 17 COP meetings to produce a global deal was actually harming the meteoric rise of clean energy that BloombergNEF was chronicling. Four years later, at COP21, the Paris Agreement was signed and, in a piece entitled We’ll Always Have Paris, I had to admit that “in retrospect I am very glad no one listened to me!”

I am older and wiser today so I am not going to call for the UNFCCC or even the COP process to be abandoned. But climate diplomacy most certainly needs a pragmatic reset.

My own first experience of COP meetings was COP14, Poznan, 2008. When I turned up, a subcommittee of the 9,000 delegates was debating whether to reopen the previous year’s agreement on the position of a comma. I kid you not. They were still at it a year later at COP15 in Copenhagen. There, the 27,000 delegates famously enjoyed freezing weather, poor food, traffic jams and huge lines, and produced… nothing of measurable benefit to the climate.

Back in Poland for COP19 in 2013, the hosts enraged the activist community by inviting businesses – including Polish coal-producing ones – to participate. By 2015, COP21 in Paris, side-events were everywhere, and delegate numbers had swelled to 30,000. COP26 Glasgow in 2021 saw 38,000 delegates (of which an undisclosed proportion caught Covid-19) at what I would argue was only the second breakthrough COP in history (Paris in 2015 being the other).

The three COP meetings since then have been hosted by oil and gas exporters Egypt, UAE and Azerbaijan. COP28 in Dubai was the UNFCCC’s Woodstock, with 84,000 delegates. We spent much of the week stuck in taxis, checking on our phones to see if the world would pretend to “phase out” unabated fossil fuels or only pretend to “transition away”. After decades of negotiations, a loss-and-damage fund was agreed – raising less than 0.1% of the market value of Saudi Aramco.

Last year’s COP29 in Baku was held in the shadow of President Trump’s re-election promise to exit the Paris Agreement for a second time. Instead of acknowledging reality, leaders of the Western democracies promised to invest $300 billion per year in developing countries by 2035. What were they thinking?

The COPs simplistic rich country / poor country classification is stuck in the last century. Today, supposedly rich countries are full of people suffering economic hardship from stagnant incomes, a cost-of-living crisis, persistent inflation, low growth and an ongoing European war. Meanwhile many supposedly poor countries (Non-Annex I Countries, in COP-speak) have skyscrapers, space programs, global multinationals, oligarchs owning European football clubs, middle classes taking international holidays, and millions of kids attending Western universities.

It is astonishingly tin-eared for Group of Seven leaders to fly off to Baku and promise to invest hundreds of billions of dollars per year in their emerging economic rivals – receiving nothing but a handful of climate indulgences in return.

The single best thing developed countries can do to ensure the decarbonization of South Africa, Indonesia or wherever, would be to succeed in decarbonizing their own economies while preserving their population’s standard of living. Do that, and the whole world will follow. Fail, and no amount of conferences or communiques on North-South climate finance will make any difference.

So, what would a pragmatic climate reset of the UNFCCC/COP look like? A full answer would require more words than you want to read. But here are some ideas:

Host the annual meeting on an island with no more than 5,000 hotel rooms, and a broader meeting only once every five years. Demand that delegations be led by ministers of finance, energy or trade rather than ministers of environment or climate.

Stop pretending plenary decisions are binding. Move from consensus to qualified majority voting. That alone would shorten meetings from two weeks to one.

Focus on sectoral deals in industry, energy and transport, rather than economy-wide agreements. Move land use, land change and forestry, or LULUCF, into its own Convention: the social, cultural and political importance of land means no government will ever let the tail of climate negotiations wag the dog of national priorities.

Shut down the loss-and-damage track. It makes no sense to build a duplicate aid infrastructure, particularly when losses cannot be unambiguously linked to climate change. Climate models which cannot predict individual storms, floods, fires or droughts cannot be used retroactively to quantify the contribution of climate to their cause – no matter how many activist scientists tell you they can.

Nearly 20 years ago, I wrote a piece explaining that climate change is not a simple prisoner’s dilemma but a repeated, multiplayer prisoner’s dilemma, which means the winning strategy is be to be “nice, retaliatory, forgiving and clear” and the role of the UNFCCC is to act as coach and mediator. It needs to focus on creating platforms for sectoral, bilateral and multilateral negotiations – not trying to deliver global economic government by means of emissions policy.

6. Reset science

In 2018, I launched the hashtag #RCP85isBollox to draw attention to the implausibility of the worst-case scenario used throughout climate research. Two years later, climate scientists Zeke Hausfather and Glen Peters published Emissions – The ‘Business As Usual’ story is misleading, agreeing that RCP8.5 needed to be retired. And yet RCP8.5 (and its modern analog SSP5-8.5) remains the most popular scenario in the climate literature, even today. This is a scandalous failure of science to self-correct.

The reason I made such a fuss about RCP8.5 was that it creates a trivially easy attack surface for opponents of climate action. And, sure enough, in his Presidential Order “Restoring Gold Standard Science”, President Trump specifically named RCP8.5, citing academic research from 2017 that showed how reaching it would involve burning more coal than exists in the world’s recoverable reserves. On this matter, though it pains me to say it, Trump is right.

Another case in point is the Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the report by five known climate sceptics intended to serve as the evidence base to revoke the EPA’s Endangerment Finding. There is much to criticize about the report, without doubt. However, it should also be noted that the original Endangerment Finding was based on research dating to before 2009, using scenarios even more extreme than RCP8.5. No one committed to science-based decisions should object to a review, in light of another 15 years’ worth of additional research and data. The focus should be on making sure the review is objective – in which case there seems little doubt the Endangerment Finding would remain in place – rather than rejecting it out-of-hand and claiming that it is entirely and completely without merit.

Today, the IPCC is about to sign off on a new set of scenarios to be used for its next Assessment Report, AR7, due out in 2029. Despite stipulating that its scenarios must be plausible, the IPCC imposes no peer-reviewed test of plausibility. The worst-case scenario which they are about to endorse (SSP3-7.0), is no more plausible today than RCP8.5 was seven years ago. I am afraid this suggests the failure to self-correct is not accidental, but intentional.

The pragmatic climate reset does not mean dismantling the entire edifice of climate science, but reforming it. IPCC scenarios really must be plausible from an energy systems perspective. And they must focus on the landing zone to which we might actually be headed – between the 1.8°C which would still count as “well below 2°C of the Paris Agreement, and the 3.5°C that is now the plausible worst case (and which US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright says would be fine and dandy, based on the modeling by William Nordhaus which won him the Nobel Prize).

Above all, scientists need to stop trying to scare people and focus on informing them. Let society do the rest.

7. Reset finance

The pragmatic climate reset also means rethinking the role of sustainable finance. The idea that you can squeeze CO2 emissions out of the real economy or achieve environmental goals by means of financial regulation and central bank interventions has been tried and found wanting.

At COP26 in Glasgow, no fewer than 60 multilateral organizations were promoting the use of finance as a way to bend the arc of the global economy toward net zero. Towering over them was the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, whose members managed assets worth $130 trillion.

It didn’t work. Threats of legal action led to the withdrawal of major names and a severe pruning of the thicket of organizations and initiatives. In late 2024, a US coalition of Republican states launched lawsuits against leading asset managers – later joined by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission – claiming that they were violating antitrust and consumer protection laws and using ESG issues as a way of driving up energy prices in order to boost their investment returns.

Even in regulation-loving Europe the tide has turned against ESG. Just as I warned in 2021, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities turned out to be “a considerable over-reach”, and attempts to get asset managers to report on Scope 3 emissions were “simply a mess”. Last year, after complaints of excessive bureaucracy from France, Germany and other countries, the European Commission and the European Banking Authority were forced to hack back reporting requirements.

The whole edifice of ESG has descended into little more than a box-ticking exercise.

While it may be possible to identify the lifecycle carbon emissions of a single product or project, when it comes to a company or investment portfolio, it is impossible. I’ll give you one example. How would the investors in New Energy Finance have rated the emissions impact of the initial million pounds raised in January 2006? We were using grid power in the office, most of which was from coal and gas, and flying to conferences and client meetings. Not good. However, over the next 20 years, New Energy Finance (now BloombergNEF) became the most trusted information provider to investors pouring trillions of dollars into climate solutions. That first million pounds may have been the single most effective climate investment in history – yet not one of today’s ESG methodologies would have given it a pass mark.

We need to get back to basics.

Companies are not vehicles for delivering social outcomes or justice. They are vehicles to produce products and services valued by customers – while respecting the spirit and letter of the law, generating returns for investors, and treating their staff and other stakeholders fairly. There is no evidence that becoming a so-called B-Corp improves behavior.

Asset managers allocate capital into well-run businesses, provide custodianship on behalf of asset owners and beneficiaries, and treat all other stakeholders fairly. Investment regulation needs to align with those goals and stop trying to save the world.

Policy makers need to stop using the financial system to discriminate against organizations active in politically unpopular parts of the economy. If they want different outcomes, they need to l regulate the real economy.

Activists too – stop claiming oil and gas companies cause emissions (especially if you yourself haven’t yet switched to green power, electric heating and no-fly holidays). We are all the cause, and we all have to be the solution.

It’s time to retire the term ESG. Once you get beyond issues of basic fairness – which is delivered through strong leadership, a healthy corporate culture and robust HR processes – ESG is all about nothing more than risk and opportunity. Every board and management team needs to understand the full set of issues that could destroy their business or present extraordinary opportunities. The fact that some may stem from environmental, social or governance factors does not justify a different department. Fire the consultants and box-tickers. Reassign the corporate sustainability officer. Focus on the issues, not the process.

The role of central banks is to maintain sound money and a dynamic, flexible economy. It is not their role to ensure the country meets environmental, social, industrial or other targets – that is the role of government. If political leaders fail to create appropriate regulations to enable capital formation around desired solutions, it is not up to central banks to second-guess them.

8. Reset policy

The pragmatic climate reset also means a new approach to policy and regulation. Here are a few thought-starters:

Remember what we learned in Part I: If clean energy grows 3% faster each year than total demand for energy services, and keeps it up for decades, fossil fuels will be squeezed off the system in a time-frame broadly consistent with 2°C. The overwhelming priority is to maintain growth in clean energy, year in and year out.

Policies designed to restrict investment in fossil fuel supply are a recipe for energy price inflation and social pushback. Without investment, global oil and gas output would decline at over 10% per year. With investment in existing fields alone, the decline would still be 4% to 6% per year. Once clean energy can meet demand growth, fossil fuels will be pushed off the system, but until then, climate justice demands that we let them keep energy costs down and the public on board.

All new climate-related grants, subsidies and regulations need to pass a value-for-money test, based on cost per ton of CO2 avoided. The calculation must include the contribution of overlapping measures, to make explicit the impact of multiple subsidies, and should be repeated at five-year intervals.

For solutions that are competitive with fossil fuels – including relevant carbon prices – policies should focus on removing barriers, not on providing funding.

Solutions that are not yet competitive may still deserve funding or regulatory support, but only if they can demonstrate a plausible pathway to a carbon price of $250 per ton within a decade – which must be peer-reviewed and published ahead of any funding decision.

Solutions that cannot meet the “plausible pathway to $250/tCO2 in a decade” value-for-money test may still receive funding, but only for R&D or pilots. They are simply not ready for prime-time and must not receive funding or regulatory support for scale-up or roll-out.

Investors who disagree with the findings of the value-for-money test are welcome to invest their own money and come back later with better evidence of a cost-reduction pathway.

Each measure providing public funding or creating a regulation-driven market must include a sunset clause. If it does not deliver as promised, if it is not on track to deliver the expected cost reductions at any five-year milestone, the measure should automatically be suspended.

Any mechanisms supporting asset investment needs to focus on the point when assets are reaching their end of life and need to be replaced anyway. There is a huge cost difference between replacing a fully-functioning boiler, car, power plant or piece of industrial equipment, and one that is fully depreciated. If no one were ever again to purchase a fossil-burning asset, the world would be on track to net zero in one asset cycle. Think about it.

Public statements relating to the cost of climate action need to differentiate carefully between total investment, additional investment, and actual costs. Too often, total investment is presented as a cost, ignoring the fact that investments have a financial return, and that investment would also be required in any fossil-based counterfactual. The actual cost of climate action to consumers is usually a fraction of the total investment, and often even negative, and it’s time for that story to be told – loudly and clearly.

Stop promoting fossil fuel consumption. There is a rich literature on fossil fuel subsidies, most of it worthless because it confuses subsidies with non-cash externalities and gives fossil fuels no credit for the royalties and taxes they generate. Just do the simple stuff: Stop cash subsidies, insulate homes instead of giving people fuel allowances, stop giving freebies to airports and tax breaks to airlines in the belief that they are magic machines for economic growth.

Shift green levies and social charges from clean to fossil-based solutions and in particular from electricity to gas. The biggest single barrier to electrification is the difference between power and gas prices. One example: with an electrical heat tariff no higher than three times the gas price, any heat pump with a coefficient of performance of three or more would reduce utility bills. No further policy would be required to drive their uptake.

Embrace locational pricing. The reason cheap renewables reached grid competitiveness in 2015 was not just falling production costs, but also because the world adopted reverse auctions. It is time for another major shift – to locational pricing. As soon as the penetration of variable renewables gets to the point that grids struggle, locational pricing matters. Incumbents hate it – they would rather be paid wherever they build wind and solar, whether it is generating or curtailed. Locational pricing shifts value from the supply side to the demand side and is essential to maintain public support for the continued growth of clean energy.

Reform the Greenhouse Gas Protocol carbon-accounting rules. The current ones, written in 1990, allow companies to claim they use 100% renewable power on the basis of annual matching – which means they can offset night-time coal use with extra purchases of daytime solar power. It’s absurd and destroys public confidence. The rules are currently under review and need to be tightened.

Summary – the Climate and Energy Reset

I said I was not going to write a manifesto. The ideas here are intended as a provocation. Some of them might make you uncomfortable, in which case I apologize. Some of them make me uncomfortable. But this is surely a moment for frank talk, given what is going on in the world.

If the climate and clean energy community wants to do more than hunker down and watch brick after brick being kicked out of the foundations of the future clean energy economy, it needs to take control of its destiny. Refresh its offer, scrape off the barnacles, and come out fighting.

A pragmatic climate reset is essential if we are to maintain momentum toward a low-carbon economy over the next few years. The transition is dead.

Reading President Ursula von der Leyen’s State of the Union amid the biggest wave of air strikes since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it’s deeply inspiring to hear her description of Europe’s “independence moment.”

Importantly, she highlights dependence on Russian fossil fuels as a central element of this campaign. This European determination to end Russian energy imports and embrace reliable and much cleaner American LNG represents a success for several decades of transatlantic energy diplomacy.

Also notable is her focus on Europe’s commitment to energy transition, including a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. At a moment when both Europe and the United States are focused on reducing China’s domination of clean energy supply chains, this is an obvious area for continuing transatlantic commercial cooperation. For instance, von der Leyen’s battery booster initiative should build naturally on what the United States has already been doing through the Minerals Security Partnership. Similarly, her strong endorsement of nuclear power as part of Europe’s strategy for energy independence suggests this as a priority focus for American companies working on next-generation nuclear and small modular reactor technologies.

The right message must be followed by real action

European sovereignty. Greater unity. Strategic autonomy. Yes, yes, and yes. These were the key—if recycled—lines adopted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her “State of the Union” annual speech at the European Parliament yesterday. Europe is encircled and needs to take care of itself—that is the message…again. But will the words be followed with action?

This time, they truly must, as every day brings worrisome proof that the global context is deteriorating. The same morning von der Leyen was delivering her speech, Russian drones for the first time penetrated the European Union—in this case, across the Polish border. Internal social maneuverability and political leadership are worsening across the continent. Also on this 10th of September, French trade unions engaged in a general strike, which coincides with a motion of no-confidence for the François Bayrou government.

And in terms of energy sovereignty, which has become increasingly critical, there has been not much progress but quite a lot of deception. Northvolt, the only European hope to match Asian batteries, has collapsed. The Iberian blackout exposed a major weakness in grid management and, by necessity, led to a ramp up of dispatchable sources. Neither Enrico Letta’s nor Mario Draghi’s report recommendations from 2024 were implemented even though everybody largely agreed with them. The past year only proved once again a hard truth: wishing for different outcomes without imagining different inputs is doomed to fail.

Europe continues to be squeezed between the necessity of importing hydrocarbons and the desire to move forward the energy transition that fuels Asian manufacturing. It now not only depends on Chinese panels and batteries, but also its wind turbines and cars—both electric and conventional. These industries, of which Europeans were once proud, are now subject to a dangerous slowdown. High energy prices and their volatility discourage new investment and harm the profitability of existing industries. If Europe wants to pass from words to action, it needs to develop an independent vision of energy sovereignty and make it an operational issue not only subject to majestic speeches.

What von der Leyen’s speech did—and did not—say

Von der Leyen’s State of the Union speech was an attempt to appease diverse political audiences, a goal that had her walking a very fine line. It was a wartime speech, which was powerful on the front end, focusing on continued support for Ukraine and surrendering to pressure from the left on Gaza. But the speech became muddled toward the end, as it morphed into a mere checklist and lost track of priorities.

To von der Leyen’s credit, she made an effort to again warn about the challenges Europe faces in an increasingly competitive and hostile global environment, while acknowledging that the Commission has been slow to act.

On energy, her statement that “it’s time to get rid of dirty Russian fossil fuels completely” was a clear rebuke to those who have been advocating a return to cheap Russian oil and gas. Also remarkable was her mention of nuclear as baseload power for more homegrown renewables, breaking with the past Commission consensus that it remain neutral on nuclear energy.

Her strong statement defending the trade agreement with the United States reflects growing criticism of the deal.

The speech, although valiantly delivered, still does not reflect a sense of urgency for Europe, but it does reflect the limits of the power of the Commission president in the face of a very divided Europe. While von der Leyen raised the famous Draghi report, European analyses timed for the speech note that only a small portion of the proposals in the Draghi report has been implemented.

Europe’s energy balancing act: nuclear power recognition, softer climate rhetoric

In her State of the Union address, President Ursula von der Leyen struck a notably pragmatic tone, prioritizing Europe’s competitiveness, defense, and strategic autonomy over major new climate announcements.

Transatlantic cooperation remained central to her message. Von der Leyen highlighted the EU-US deal, underlining its importance for protecting European jobs and portraying it as a stronger outcome than what others managed to secure—signaling both the strategic and economic weight of this partnership.

Nuclear power was explicitly acknowledged as part of Europe’s clean energy pathway, reflecting Brussels’ growing openness, influenced by France’s demands for greater recognition in the 2040 climate targets or by the US interest in nuclear projects, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. Enlargement, too, was emphasized, reaffirming the European future of the Western Balkans, Moldova, and Ukraine—a development that must drive a deeper debate on energy security in these regions.

Notably, “green” and “climate” were mentioned only five times, compared to eighteen mentions in the last State of the Union in 2023, with the 2040 targets briefly referenced amid ongoing heated negotiations in Brussels. Energy affordability, however, remained a central theme of the address.

Despite drawing clear lines between friends and foes, von der Leyen underscored that Europe must remain “open to the world and choose partnerships with allies—old and new,” a statement that may reflect an evolving view of a multipolar global order.

Boosting European batteries is a start

President von der Leyen’s “battery booster package” is a start, but the €1.8 billion for equity to boost production in Europe pales in comparison to over $230 billion in subsidies China lavished on electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries from 2009 to 2023—and even the United States continues to invest tens of billions of dollars in its battery/EV complex despite a less favorable policy environment. Europe risks being left behind in this cutting-edge technology.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Germany’s removal of the debt brake could prioritize battery and EV investment, while other northern European countries enjoy fiscal space that must be balanced against inflation risks. There’s also an urgent need to build on embryonic Europe-US cooperation in advanced batteries.

Finally, advanced batteries hold important security implications for European countries—especially Ukraine. Next-generation, Western-made batteries, with greater energy density, would enable Western forces to outrange Russian drones powered by Chinese batteries. With battery-powered, first-person view (FPV) drones changing battlefield tactics in Ukraine, the EU should prioritize battery investment.

Given batteries’ relevancy for Europe’s military, economic, and climate objectives, the Commission and Member States must build on the battery booster package.

Europe’s call for greater energy security could be met through the Black Sea region

Von der Leyen’s urgent call to rewire Europe’s energy map positions the Black Sea region as a key element in reducing dependence on Russian fossil fuels faster and advancing European energy independence. The “Energy Highways” initiative and upcoming Grids Package target persistent gaps in cross-border infrastructure in Central Europe. By prioritizing grid upgrades, new interconnectors, and faster permitting, the Commission signals that Black Sea offshore wind, nuclear capacity, and other clean energy projects can be integrated quickly if they are backed by committed investment and political will.

Von der Leyen’s reference to “crucial stability in our relations with the US” also has implications for regional energy security. Stable EU-US trade relations prevent tariff shocks that could disrupt important infrastructure development. The planned Vertical Gas Corridor would channel US and other non-Russian LNG into the Black Sea region, diversifying essential natural gas routes. In addition, US partnerships on nuclear energy, especially small modular reactors and Cernavodă modernization in Romania, would provide long-term, low-emissions power. These transatlantic links and EU initiatives collectively support the Black Sea’s development into an energy hub that is critical to Europe’s clean energy transition and strategic independence.

The road ahead for European energy security

Von der Leyen’s emphasis on energy infrastructure in the State of the European Union marks a positive step forward for European energy security and competitiveness. This suggests the Commission is responding to last year’s Draghi report warnings about permitting delays and grid constraints.

However, the slow pace so far in advancing European competitiveness raises doubts about how much this agenda will be acted upon. The Commission’s pledge earlier this year to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028 was long overdue, albeit a welcome rhetorical shift. But without proper diversification of energy sources, the EU risks replacing one dependency with another, shifting from Russian gas to increased US liquefied natural gas imports, and ultimately falling short of delivering the strategic autonomy that von der Leyen emphasized throughout her address.

Her call to double down on homegrown renewables, with nuclear as a baseload, and to modernize and invest in infrastructure and interconnectors is a promising step forward. For Central and Eastern Europe in particular, this could further accelerate progress toward meeting the EU’s 2030 climate targets while enhancing long-term energy security. Yet without national buy-in—as seen in Hungary and Slovakia’s resistance to the fossil fuel phase-out, and Austria’s recent legal opposition to nuclear settled by the court this week—these proposals risk becoming at best, slow moving, and at worst, more rhetoric than reality.

Dive Brief:

In the first half of this year, total project finance lending to the U.S. clean energy industry increased to around $86 billion, up from $80 billion in the first half of 2024, according to a Monday report from Crux, a finance technology company that connects tax credit buyers and sellers.

The clean energy industry faced considerable policy uncertainty this year after President Donald Trump took office and rolled back some Biden administration policies, then worked with Congress to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which curtailed many of the tax credits offered by the Inflation Reduction Act.

“The market is growing and becoming much more diverse,” said Crux CEO Alfred Johnson. “We’re still seeing a lot of volume from wind and solar, and anticipate to continue to see it as projects are placed into service over the next four years. But the dynamic of increased diversification is definitely going to continue, and we expect to be even more pronounced in the back half of the year.”

Dive Insight:

A lot of that diversity is coming from parts of the industry which saw their tax credits less trimmed by the OBBBA, which targeted benefits to wind and solar in particular. Storage tax credits made it through largely unscathed, and transactions on those are “booming,” Johnson said.

Crux’s report estimates that the total transferable tax credit market exceeded $20 billion in the first half of this year, almost doubling from the first half of 2024.

“A critical driver of this growth was the broadening range of technologies and sponsors active in the market, with energy storage projects in particular gaining market share alongside established solar and wind deals as well as newly eligible credits from advanced manufacturing, clean fuels, geothermal, and other sectors,” the report said.

Johnson noted that there is “continued bipartisan support for categories like advanced manufacturing, critical minerals, nuclear, biofuels, that continue to see significant amounts of investment, and that is materializing in the tax credit market.”

Crux’s report said that not all technologies face “the same accelerating investment as storage.” Onshore and offshore wind energy, which have been targeted by the Trump administration, “face headwinds to new investment. The proportion of wind PTCs sold in the transfer market declined to 9.5% during 1H2025 from 33.0% in 1H2024.”

Tax credits benefitting wind and solar are winding down earlier than anticipated, and are subject to new and onerous foreign entity of concern requirements.

“The market has some real pockets of financial distress as some developers that premised their business on a prior reality of policy and development are having to come to terms with the new reality,” Johnson said.

Johnson said there are numerous and cross-cutting forces at work in the current clean energy market, making it “difficult to discern the net effects – which is why I find the conclusion that the market grew so materially from the first half of 2024 to 2025 to be so interesting.”

“It suggests that there are a lot of forces that drive this development, and we are in a moment of categorical expansion of energy need and domestic manufacturing, and that will play out through trillions of dollars being invested in energy infrastructure and manufacturing over the next decade,” he said. “It’s just going to be shaped somewhat differently than it might have been in a prior policy environment.”

Crux estimates that the tax credit market is likely to shrink from the first half of the year to the second, a forecast that Johnson called “admittedly conservative.” Part of the reason for that, he said, is that much of the volume in the second half of 2024 came from transactions on future year credits.

“Given some of the dynamics in policy and what we are seeing in terms of buyer bidding behavior, with tax liabilities reduced somewhat … We have not yet called the ball on there being as much forward investment and tax credit purchases as there were in the second half of last year,” he said.

Crux also found that nearly all of the wind tax credits — and around two-thirds of the solar tax credits — that the company expects to transact in 2025 have already been sold.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4wI3lOZwJZ8EIOR6C4RTuvXh_zC-MG6aAWHA4PpdOX0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DTkhFNDUuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-11 15:00:39.192520

Lawmakers on both sides increasingly recognize that permitting delays now jeopardize far more than developer timelines, they threaten U.S. energy security, grid reliability and competitiveness.","Clean energy and traditional baseload energy alike are significantly constrained by a permitting system that cannot keep pace with the nation’s growing energy needs. Federal permitting processes are notoriously complex, and the challenges only multiply when layered with state and local requirements. Developers must navigate overlapping environmental reviews, interagency approvals and jurisdictional inconsistencies, creating uncertainty and costly delays.

Energy facility and other infrastructure projects, regardless of the type of resource or technology, have found themselves delayed years beyond their feasible siting and construction timeframes. For solar and wind projects, it has become the norm rather than the exception for permitting plus other delays to add anywhere from two to four, or more, years. These delays are often longer for wind, particularly offshore.

This permitting dilemma has been further complicated by recent reductions in personnel and reprioritization at the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Department of Energy, agencies critical to the processing of rights of way, environmental impact analyses and other necessary approvals.

With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) changes to the clean energy tax incentives also now in place, the urgency to finalize permits has only heightened. Unlike other projects, solar and wind now face immediate deadlines to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service before 2028 to qualify for the Internal Revenue Code Sections 45Y and 48E production and investment tax credits. Against this backdrop, permitting reform has shifted from a long-term policy goal to an immediate necessity. Without meaningful changes, delays in securing approvals will threaten eligibility for these critical tax incentives and jeopardize the nation’s ability to meet emergent and future energy needs.

Permitting reform is needed immediately to ensure clean energy projects meet new deadlines to qualify for critical tax incentives and can more quickly add critical capacity to the power grid.

IRS Beginning of Construction Standards and the Looming OBBBA Deadline

Under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) beginning of construction guidance, Notice 2025-42, issued Aug. 15, taxpayers may now only establish that a wind or solar project has begun construction using the physical work test in order to qualify for the Sections 45Y and 48E tech-neutral incentives. (Read more about the implications of Notice 2025-42 here.)

In designating the physical work test as the sole method by which projects may certify that they have begun construction, the IRS also reaffirmed the existing standards for establishing physical work. In prior guidance, the IRS determined that there are certain reasonable disruptions to continuous construction and outlined specific incidents beginning in Notice 2013-29 and expanded on in Notice 2018-59. But while the new guidance preserves these permitted disruptions, including, “delays in obtaining permits or licenses from federal, state, local, or Indian tribal governments,” any delays in progress towards sufficiently beginning construction and then placing facilities in service inherently create additional risk.

Projects must both satisfy physical work and continuous construction requirements and may do so for the latter by placing a project in service within four calendar years of the calendar year in which construction begins. Allowable delays are not taken into consideration under this “continuity safe harbor,” and permissible extensions of the timeframe are not provided by any guidance, prior or new. Delays in permitting will therefore continue to jeopardize qualification for this safe harbor eligibility. This applies to both the physical work test and the 5% safe harbor still allowed for small solar projects producing 1.5 megawatts or less of alternating current generation.

If not claiming the continuity safe harbor, whether a project has satisfied the physical work or 5% safe harbor and continuous construction requirements comes down to the “facts and circumstances,” as determined by the IRS. This distinction has enormous implications for developers and tax equity investors:

A project that begins construction in 2025 but experiences prolonged permitting delays risks falling outside the four-year safe harbor, jeopardizing eligibility for Sections 45Y and 48E credits.

If the continuity safe harbor is missed, the IRS evaluates eligibility based on facts and circumstances, introducing significant uncertainty.

With solar and wind projects under more scrutiny and the July 4, 2026, deadline looming and additional foreign entity of concern restrictions on the way, even relatively short permitting delays could derail projects, strand capital and destabilize tax equity markets.

Lack of Solar and Wind Projects Jeopardize Grid Capacity and Reliability

While developers grapple with shortened timelines and complex approvals, grid operators are sounding alarms about growing reliability risks. Demand for electricity is climbing sharply, driven by three structural trends reshaping U.S. energy consumption: the rapid expansion of AI data centers, increasing electrification and growing domestic manufacturing capacity.

At the end of 2024, Grid Strategies published a forecast that electricity demand will increase almost 16% by 2029, totaling 128 gigawatts (GWs). This would require a fivefold increase in load capacity. Growth that the nation has not seen since the 1980s. This five-year forecast increase expects this historic load growth to be significantly concentrated within the PJM Interconnection regional transmission organization (RTO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) footprints. The report's estimates are based on annual planning reports submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by electric balancing authorities and updated with additional data from utilities and planning regions.

AI data centers, in particular, are driving incremental load growth far faster than previous forecasts. In some regions, these facilities are expected to add gigawatts of annual demand, with nationwide AI-related consumption projected to reach about 10% of total U.S. electricity demand by 2030, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. Electrification policies and market shifts are adding to the strain, while new industrial facilities increase pressure on already stretched capacity margins.

To maintain reliability, grid operators are stressing the need for unprecedented volumes of new renewable generation and storage, in addition to other resources, grid modernization and transmission infrastructure. Even though the intermittency of wind and solar has posed reliability challenges, when paired with storage or other existing base load generation, they can quickly add vital capacity. Texas is currently proving this out as its chance of rolling blackouts during summer peak demand were reduced to only 0.30% from 12% in 2024 and weathers unexpected outages from coal plants by running on 40.2% wind and solar generation.

Other regional organizations also already have the spare capacity for additional resources. PJM Interconnection, for example, the largest RTO in the United States and at high-risk for future capacity shortfalls, has as much as 153 gigawatts of surplus capacity that could be filled by solar, wind and storage, according to University of California, Berkeley. PJM's recently updated Surplus Interconnection Service (SIS) process also permits expedited review outside the standard interconnection queue for projects that do not require transmission system upgrades. A SIS allows new resources to utilize unused interconnection capacity of existing generating facilities without increasing the total interconnection service at a point of interconnection. UC Berkley found that California could similarly add 53 GWs of clean energy capacity, including solar and wind, and 23 GWs of storage, for a total of 76 additional GWs. Yet many projects end up stalled by permitting delays at all levels, in addition to having to navigate backlogged interconnection queues and attempt to qualify for exemptions.

In New England, reliability concerns are continuing to build. The Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE) recently warned that the DOI’s stop-work order for the Revolution Wind project threatens near-term system stability, underscoring how individual project delays can ripple through regional capacity planning. Without accelerated deployment, regions across the country risk falling behind demand growth, facing higher prices and compromising grid reliability at a time when every electron is needed, so to speak.

NEPA Holds the Spotlight

Though the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023 amended the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to both streamline and circumvent the application of NEPA environmental analyses, the consensus is that these are not enough and, many argue, are not effectively accelerating the permitting process while still safeguarding the environment and public inclusion. The FRA of 2023 established certain time and page limits and a lead agency policy, allows for cross-agency adoption of categorical exclusions, and amended the core mandate of NEPA to limit the consideration of environmental impacts to only those that are “reasonably foreseeable,” among other provisions.

The current administration has additionally instituted deregulatory updates to NEPA procedures broadly across the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and all relevant agencies, building on decisions by the courts regarding CEQ and agency authorities. In the case regarding CEQ’s authority, the D.C. Circuit determined in November 2024 that CEQ does not have the degree of authority that it has exercised for almost five decades to issue NEPA regulations for agencies.

In the other regarding a new 88-mile rail in Utah, the Supreme Court of the United States in May 2025 determined that federal agencies should conduct more limited environmental reviews of the impacts of proposed projects and not take downstream effects (Scope 3) into consideration. Scope 3 emissions encompass all sources outside of Scope 1 and 2 boundaries. They are the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in a company’s value chain but are not produced by the company itself or its owned or controlled assets, such as emissions from purchasing, using, and disposing of products from suppliers.

These agency actions further minimize the role of NEPA and environmental analyses in the permitting approval process and, like the FRA of 2023, do not sufficiently address enhancing process efficiency for energy infrastructure. Substantial reforms to thoroughly yet responsibly streamline the federal permitting process for clean energy infrastructure are still needed to more expeditiously construct and bring generation facilities and transmission online. Solar and wind facilities face earlier 2026 and 2028 deadlines than other net-zero emissions generation technologies seeking to claim Sections 45Y and 48E, and the datacenter and electrification booms are only just beginning.

More Expansive Efforts Have Fallen Short

In response to the looming electricity supply-demand crisis, lawmakers have continually raised the issue of permitting reforms to the top of the policy agenda for the last several years, but as of yet, have been unable been unable to establish a highly tenable, passable bipartisan compromise. The Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 introduced by former Senator and chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Joe Manchin, I-West Virginia, and the former ranking member, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, last year during the final months of the 118th Congress garnered bipartisan support. The bill proposed to expedite the permitting process for energy and mineral projects by shortening judicial review timelines and setting deadlines for federal agency actions. It accelerated leasing and permitting decisions and increased capacity goals for onshore and offshore energy projects, including renewables, reforms electric transmission planning and sets deadlines for liquified natural gas export applications. The bill also included provisions to improve electric reliability, modernize geothermal and hydropower permitting processes, and streamline mining sites. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources proposal came close to satisfying the priorities and assuaging the concerns of both sides of the aisle but was unable to build and sustain the impetus needed for passage before the end of the Congress.

A discussion draft of another proposal was simultaneously released by the House Natural Resources Committee at the end of 2024, led by the committee chair, Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas. Westerman’s proposal, unlike the Manchin-Barrasso bill, only included House Republican priorities for significantly reforming NEPA and limiting judicial review. In a committee hearing on the proposal, Westerman said that the bill would make common sense reforms to NEPA to limit the number of projects subject to NEPA review by ensuring projects that receive federal funding are not automatically subject to legal review; clarify the scope of review; and create timelines to expedite the judicial review process, limit standing for serial litigants and reduce vacatur and injunctions.

Westerman emphasized that the bill is technology and sector neutral and would streamline the process for all projects, but the proposal was met with significant Democratic opposition. They opposed the bill for similar reasons that they opposed the FRA of 2023, asserting that it would reduce timelines so much that they would become untenable and would weaken community engagement and environmental protections. Democrats insisted that NEPA is not the essential problem, it is the lack of human capital, other resources, modernization and therefore permit processing capacity that hinders the timeliness of reviews. As evidence, Democrats submitted a 2015 report by Natural Resources Defense Council to the record, which details cases in which the NEPA process has saved money and time, improved projects, and achieved better outcomes for communities and the environment.

During the 118th Congress, Democrats also introduced many of their own proposals, focusing on incentivizing and fast-tracking transmission, renewable energies and grid operational and technology modernization.

Like their Republican counterparts, these proposals similarly fell short of enticing bipartisan interest and progress towards passage of a compromise package.

Looking Ahead: Permitting Reform in the 119th Congress

The stakes for permitting reform are higher than ever and for developers and investors, the next 10 months are pivotal. OBBBA’s accelerated cutoff requires projects to have begun construction under the new Notice 2025-42 guidance by July 5, 2026, to still qualify for the full extent of the Sections 45Y and 48E credits. They will otherwise be required to be placed in service before 2028 to qualify. At the same time, AI-driven demand, electrification and manufacturing reshoring are also compressing grid planning horizons and raising the stakes for timely deployment.

In addition to its NEPA reforms, the FRA of 2023 also directed the CEQ to study the use of online and digital technologies to reduce delays in project reviews and enhance public accessibility and transparency. The study was intended to explore the use of a permitting portal for real-time document submission and collaboration, as well as a cloud-based tool to improve interagency coordination and streamline communications.

In response to industry, agencies and lawmakers, in April 2025, President Trump built on the FRA’s directive to modernize permitting technology by issuing a memorandum and launching in May the Permitting Technology Action Plan, which directs federal agencies to maximize technology use in environmental review and permitting processes.

In Congress, both parties have expressed a desire for a deal, with Democrats focusing on expanding the nation's grid for renewable energy and Republicans aiming to revamp environmental laws to accelerate various projects. During floor remarks in July, Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, and Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse discussed the need for permitting reform, though Whitehouse and Democrats remain hesitant, citing the administration's actions regarding congressional authority and judicial orders. Additionally, many Republicans are reluctant to make it easier to build power lines through their states and support renewables.

Just after OBBBA passage, on July 17, Reps. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, and Scott Peters, D-California, introduced the bipartisan ePermit Act to digitize the U.S. permitting process and reduce processing times for NEPA reviews. The proposed ePermit Act intends to build on the recommendations from the administration, and so also the FRA of 2023, by providing legislative direction on how agencies should implement an electronic permitting system.

Shortly after, on July 25, House Natural Resources Committee Chair Westerman and Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, introduced a new permitting reform package, Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. Similar to Westerman’s 2024 proposal, the SPEED Act again focuses on further NEPA reforms to accelerate approvals for energy infrastructure.

Westerman's new NEPA proposal aims to codify the recent Supreme Court ruling that limits the scope of environmental reviews to only the direct impacts of a project, excluding broader effects. The bill builds on the FRA of 2023 by setting a two-year limit for Environmental Impact Statements and a one-year limit for environmental assessments and narrowing the definition of ""major federal action"" by excluding federal funds, loans, or loan guarantees as triggers for NEPA to prevent agencies from considering upstream or downstream consequences.

The bill also restricts judicial challenges by requiring lawsuits to be filed within 150 days and setting a 180-day deadline for court judgments. Only parties who provided substantive comments during the public review period can issue legal challenges. Additionally, it limits a court's ability to remand agency decisions, allowing an agency’s decision to stand while errors or deficiencies are corrected. Republicans have made addressing litigation a priority because of the significant delays to project construction it can cause.

The House Natural Resources Committee held a hearing Sept. 10 on the SPEED Act, the ePermit Act, and another bill that would establish an annual CEQ study and report on NEPA’s impacts on projects.

While Westerman’s bill again reflects House Republican priorities and faces challenges in a narrowly controlled Republican Senate, it and other proposed legislation have reignited bipartisan discussions. Lawmakers on both sides increasingly recognize that permitting delays now jeopardize far more than developer timelines, they threaten U.S. energy security, grid reliability and competitiveness.

The coming months will determine whether Congress can deliver a durable compromise, or whether permitting bottlenecks will continue to strain developers, destabilize tax equity financing and threaten grid reliability. Project developers and other stakeholders are encouraged to stay actively engaged and participate in industry coalitions tracking legislative developments closely and advocating for bipartisan reforms.

The Iowa Environmental Council says it’s possible for the state to meet higher demand and achieve the carbon-free electricity goal.

Renewable energy from wind and solar rose to 67% last year in Iowa, according to the IEC’s latest Condition of the State report. But import taxes on materials, including a 50% tariff on steel, and a rollback on federal tax credits could dampen momentum.

“A wind turbine is almost all steel. And it’d be nice if all that steel was available here in the U.S., but it’s not. So, as that steel is imported, that’s certainly going to increase the cost of building that turbine,” said Steve Guyer, IEC’s senior energy policy counsel.

The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday it will hear a case challenging the legality of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Utility-scale wind and solar projects also face a severely shortened timeline for federal tax credits after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law this summer. Projects must begin construction before July of next year to qualify for subsidies.

“It’s very possible that as we look at this rapid increase in demand, they may be viable even without those tax credits. But sort of crystal-balling this, it’s sort of hard to tell what impact will really occur,” Guyer said.

The IEC report and other research show the costs to build and maintain wind and solar are cheaper than coal and natural gas, even without subsidies.

Earlier this year, Alliant Energy and MidAmerican Energy proposed large-scale wind and solar projects.

The authors of the IEC report said Iowa’s utilities “must aggressively act to take full advantage of any Inflation Reduction Act incentives” and advocate for the elimination of coal generation by 2030.

Not only are data centers driving Illinois' clean energy transition, they are major job creators.
There is no industry better suited to help support Illinois' clean energy and technology leadership than the data center industry.
The state's data center industry will continue to be a constructive partner in this effort to devise practical solutions to the state's energy needs.
Josh Levi is president of the Data Center Coalition, the national trade association for the data center industry.","The average U.S. household now has 21 different devices connected to the internet, enabling everything from computers and cell phones to smart lighting and appliances. Beyond personal uses, cloud-based computing is now central to our economic growth, supporting countless industries. This demand, along with artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge applications, is creating a growing need for data storage and processing made possible by data centers — the physical facilities that provide the digital infrastructure supporting our modern lives and the 21st century economy.

Illinois has become one of the most important states in the country for deploying data centers, which have already created thousands of jobs and contributed billions in direct economic impact in the Prairie State, all while driving clean energy investments that are critical to making the state's clean energy transition a reality.

In fact, data centers have long been drivers of the clean energy transition, both in development and deployment. In 2024, half of all U.S clean energy procurement in solar and wind projects was attributed to companies that operate data centers. Data center operations are also highly efficient and leverage the latest innovations in facility design, cooling and technology to maximize our collective computing output.

Even better, data centers unlock tangible energy savings and efficiencies — for Illinois homes, businesses, utilities, government and other industries — by facilitating smart thermostats, managed electric vehicle charging, grid-enhancing technologies and more. Data center companies also invest in distribution- and transmission-level infrastructure that benefits all electricity users, helping modernize the nation's electricity grid.

The opportunity to fortify Illinois' clean energy future is already at hand, including through a recent commitment from Meta that supports the relicensing of over 16 gigawatts of carbon-free power and an additional 30 megawatts of power at the Clinton Clean Energy Center, enabling continued operation of the facility without increasing costs to ratepayers. Other data center companies are making similar investments toward expanding the state's clean energy supply, such as Digital Realty, which recently announced an agreement to support three solar projects in the state.

In short, data centers are helping to develop a resilient, affordable energy infrastructure for Illinois, all while driving the state's broader economic and energy transformation.

Not only are data centers driving Illinois' clean energy transition, they are major job creators. A recent study from PwC found that Illinois' data centers supported more than 115,000 jobs across the state in 2023, an 8% increase in employment in just one year. For every job inside a facility, six more are supported across the broader economy, according to the study. As these projects are built and maintained over several years, they help anchor stable, high-paying careers in the skilled trades.

The investments made by the data center industry also create significant benefits for local governments. The PwC study found that data centers contributed more than $1.8 billion in state and local taxes to Illinois in 2023, helping support investments in community priorities like education, transportation and public safety that enhance the quality of life for Illinois communities.

These positive impacts didn't happen by accident. They are largely due to the forward-looking leadership of Gov. JB Pritzker and legislators in creating a successful economic development program and encouraging investments that have contributed to Illinois' progress over the last six years in making the state ""open for business"" once again. In fact, a 2024 Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity report confirmed that more than $15 billion in data center investment has come to Illinois as a result of the state's tax exemption program.

There is no industry better suited to help support Illinois' clean energy and technology leadership than the data center industry. As Illinois looks to consider new energy policy proposals, state lawmakers should adopt policies that signal the state is welcoming data center investment in digital infrastructure and clean energy projects, and avoid policies that risk driving these investments to neighboring states.

To meet this moment and harness the opportunity, legislators should commit to a comprehensive, data-driven evaluation of the state's energy needs, convene stakeholder meetings that allow public participation and consider thoughtful legislation that helps keep energy costs affordable while driving more clean power generation to meet statewide demand.

The state's data center industry will continue to be a constructive partner in this effort to devise practical solutions to the state's energy needs. By continuing to support the growing data center industry, the state can support Illinois' clean energy transition while minimizing the growth in energy costs, creating more high-wage jobs, ensuring consistent financial support for community priorities and maintaining its competitiveness.

The result is toxicity values that are out of step with peer reviewed literature and other global chemical assessments.
The EPA is undergoing internal reforms within the office that oversees the IRIS Program, and the U.S. House of Representatives has repeatedly voted to eliminate funding for IRIS assessments.
Most recently, the House included language in its FY2026 Appropriations bill to defund the IRIS Program entirely and prohibit the use of IRIS assessments in rulemaking.
The No IRIS Act would prohibit EPA from using IRIS assessments in regulatory decisions.","On September 17th, industry leaders will gather on Capitol Hill to advocate for the No IRIS Act (H.R.1415/S.623)—a bill that offers a durable, science-based solution to addressing longstanding problems with the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program.

For years, the IRIS Program has operated without Congressional authorization, issuing chemical assessments that often lack transparency and scientific rigor. These assessments have significant, real-world implications when they are used to inform regulatory decision-making and despite some modest reforms over the years, the IRIS Program continues to minimize or exclude high quality, relevant information, and default to overly conservative options when evaluating scientific information.

The result is toxicity values that are out of step with peer reviewed literature and other global chemical assessments. IRIS toxicity values are frequently set below naturally occurring background levels, detection limits, or even levels produced by the human body. This disconnect undermines regulatory credibility, puts access to critical chemistries in jeopardy, and threatens innovation across critical sectors of our economy that rely on the best available science to underlie decision-making.

Overly burdensome and scientifically flawed assessments like those produced by the IRIS Program jeopardize America’s chemical manufacturing sector—an industry responsible for over $600 billion in economic impact and more than 4 million jobs. In an era of global competition and supply chain vulnerability, maintaining a strong, science-based regulatory framework is not just an economic imperative, it’s a matter of national security. We must ensure that chemicals can be produced safely in America, so that we aren’t dependent on foreign sources.

For decades, multiple stakeholders, including the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, have raised concerns about the IRIS Program’s scientific methods and conclusions and called for improvements. Additionally, since 2009, the program has remained on the GAO’s High-Risk List, flagged for vulnerability to mismanagement and lack of accountability.

Policymakers are starting to take notice--and take action. In May, the White House issued an Executive Order directing agencies to rely on “gold standard” science that is transparent and rigorous. The EPA is undergoing internal reforms within the office that oversees the IRIS Program, and the U.S. House of Representatives has repeatedly voted to eliminate funding for IRIS assessments. Most recently, the House included language in its FY2026 Appropriations bill to defund the IRIS Program entirely and prohibit the use of IRIS assessments in rulemaking.

While these are important steps, this moment demands a durable legislative solution—to give the American public assurance that the best available science is the foundation for regulations and provide manufacturers the certainty they need to grow the American economy. The No IRIS Act would prohibit EPA from using IRIS assessments in regulatory decisions. It’s a straightforward step toward restoring scientific integrity and transparency in chemical evaluation.

American success relies on American chemistry. From agriculture and infrastructure to semiconductors and national defense, nearly every corner of our economy depends on the safe, innovative, and reliable production of chemical products. The No IRIS Act helps ensure that this critical sector is governed by objective, transparent, science-based policies.",https://www.americanchemistry.com/var/site/storage/images/3/4/9/2/2943-2-eng-US/Lab-Male-Female-Working-Together.png,N,,2025-09-11 14:01:35.806576

Utilizing wind energy adds to the diverse portfolio of greener energy options, which include solar, geothermal, energy harnessed from ocean waves, and, to an imperfect extent that is still better for the atmosphere, nuclear power. With various sources, energy independence and reduced reliance on toxic and polluting dirty fuels, regardless of location, is more feasible. Cleaner power means cleaner air and water for all life to thrive.

Buy now and you might miss out on better technology or lower prices in the future. Wait and you could miss out on the current rebates and incentives. It’s a bit like trying to time the stock market. Keep reading as we look into whether now is a good time to buy an electric vehicle or if it makes more sense to wait.

Also here are EV expenses you may not be aware of.

EV Adoption and Trends

EVs are quickly growing in numbers on the road. According to Rho Motion, approximately 9.1 million electric cars were sold worldwide in the first half of 2025. This is a 28% increase over the first half of 2024. Why is this trend happening? Part of it is because more manufacturers are releasing new electric models, which gives buyers more options to choose from.

Additionally, charging stations are being installed in more convenient locations. Larger cities have them at grocery stores, shopping malls and even in parking lots across town. They can even be found at larger office buildings. However, even though the number of charging stations is increasing, things aren’t ideal for everyone. Small towns have fewer options, making it crucial that owners can charge at home.

For You: 7 Reasons You Should Switch To an Electric Vehicle in Retirement

One of the biggest issues that’s kept people from purchasing an electric vehicle in the past has been battery technology. But even that’s improving. New electric models can go further without needing a charge. This makes them good for not only city driving, but also people looking to travel out of town.

Reasons To Buy Now

If you’ve been considering an electric car, there are a few reasons why you might want to buy now rather than waiting.

Incentives and rebates: Depending on where you live, your state may have rebates available for electric vehicles. Plus, federal rebates currently offer $7,500 when you purchase a new electric vehicle or $4,000 when you buy used. However, because of the Big Beautiful Bill, these federal rebates will expire on Sept. 30, 2025.

Lower Costs to Run: With the average price of gas being over $3.00 per gallon (per AAA), it’s cheaper for most people to run an electric car as long as you have the ability to charge at home.

Technology Has Improved: Range has always been one of the key reasons why people haven’t made the change from gas to electric. However, new technology has increased the range electric cars can make it without needing a charge.

“Now is a good time to buy an EV,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book (KBB). “There’s a greater choice than ever before. There are various discounts and rebates available, some are regional, some are national. Also, the popularity of some EV models is declining so a little research by the shopper could end up getting them an exceptional deal.”

Reasons To Wait

While there are many reasons why people might want to buy an electric vehicle now, some people might find it better to wait.

Technology continues to improve: Even though technology has improved, delaying your purchase might lead to further improvements. The driving range could improve even more and charging could become faster, all of which drivers desire most.

Drop in prices: As more car manufacturers continue to release electric models, prices could fall even further.

Home charging not available: One of the biggest reasons why a potential buyer might want to wait is that they don’t have access to home charging. This can significantly increase the costs of ownership.

“Without charging at home, you don’t get the full benefit of the EV,” said Joseph Nagle, head of corporate strategy at Pando Electric. “Not only are you paying far higher prices for electricity at a public charger, but it’s significantly more convenient and enjoyable to simply come home, plug in and go about your life.”

Why Storage Matters to Clean Power

Renewable equipment is full of sensors and controllers. These systems write logs, record faults, and push updates. If storage fails, a turbine may stop or a solar gateway may lose data. That is costly. Delkin says its flash is designed for these “unforgiving conditions,” and it offers high-endurance options for steady writes over time.

Grid gear and renewable plants face sudden power cuts. A clean shutdown is not always possible. To reduce corruption, Delkin solid-state drives use power-fail protection at the device level. The company describes a mix of hardware and firmware methods that trigger during a loss event to protect in-flight data. That kind of guardrail helps systems boot cleanly after an outage and keeps event records usable.

Built in the U.S., with Lifecycle Control

According to Delkin’s site, design, manufacturing, and support are U.S.-led, with operations in Poway, California. The company highlights controlled bills of materials and lifecycle management for OEM programs, plus ISO 9001:2015 certification. That approach helps teams keep a stable configuration over years, which can reduce surprise re-qualifications in long-lived energy assets.

Delkin also points to on-site U.S. manufacturing as a way to speed custom work and keep quality under one roof. They note options like HALT (Highly Accelerated Life Testing) and value-added features such as conformal coating, which can be useful in dusty yards and outdoor enclosures.

Hardware Options Seen in the Field

Delkin lists a broad product set: industrial SSD, SD and microSD, CompactFlash, USB, mSATA, and more. That breadth lets integrators match hosts across old and new equipment. For small, low-power designs, the industrial microSD line targets embedded logging with simple integration. And in tiny footprints that still need speed, Delkin’s BGA SSDs offer NVMe Gen4 performance, error correction (LDPC + RAID ECC), and an extended temperature range that reaches from −40 °C to +105 °C. Those specs fit controllers packed into nacelles, cabinets, and edge gateways.

Quick Facts

Target sites: wind, solar, and other energy assets in extreme settings.

Power-loss defense: SSD-level protection to reduce data corruption on unexpected shutoffs.

Made in the U.S.: U.S.-led design and manufacturing with lifecycle control for OEMs.

Tiny but tough: BGA SSD option with NVMe and wide temperature support.

microSD for edge: small size, low power, and high reliability for embedded use.

Where It Fits (Examples)

Renewable energy systems: storage for controllers and loggers that run 24/7.

Industrial and utility gateways: local caching and firmware storage at the edge.

Remote sites with harsh weather: endurance and temperature tolerance to keep reporting.

Details for microSD design targets come from Delkin’s product pages. BGA SSD specifications include NVMe, ECC, and the wide temperature range. SSD power-fail behavior is described in the firm’s technology section.

Operational Context

Industrial failures cost more than a broken gadget. They can stop output, delay service, or risk safety. Delkin’s writing on industrial use makes that point and lists sectors that need tougher parts than consumer gear. Energy is one of those sectors. Storage here is not a nice-to-have; it is part of running the plant.

The company also shares guidance on common field issues. One example is SD cards that turn “write-protected” in service. The advice explains why it happens and how to respond so uptime improves. That kind of support matters when a site is miles away and windows for repair are short.

CEO Drew Marsh called the three natural gas-fueled power plants the utility is building for Meta's new north Louisiana data center big wins for the state, but they will likely keep the utility from meeting its goal to cut emissions in half by 2030.
Estimates are that the facility will draw twice the power that the city of New Orleans uses on a hot summer day.
The power plants will likely employ another 50 people.
Marsh, who is chair of the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, said the country needs to maintain its existing power plants and ease regulations so more can come online.
Marsh's remarks echoed others at the event, where the focus has shifted away from clean energy in favor of a more pragmatic approach.","Entergy Corp. CEO Drew Marsh called the three natural gas-fueled power plants the utility is building for Meta's new north Louisiana data center big wins for the state, but they will likely keep the utility from meeting its goal to cut emissions in half by 2030.

In a speech Wednesday to more than 300 energy professionals, policymakers and students at Tulane University’s Future of Energy Forum, Marsh said the huge new power plants, expected to cost more than $3 billion, will improve grid reliability for customers statewide at a cost of pushing back some of its carbon goals.

“It makes it harder to reach our goals in the near term, but I think it has the potential to make it easier in the long term,” said Marsh, who heads the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in New Orleans. “2030 is going to be tough, but I think we still have a good shot at 2050, because Meta can bring its $2 trillion company to bear on this problem and help us clean up.”

Entergy was instrumental in landing the $10 million Meta data center, which is heralded by some as one of the biggest economic development wins in state history. Others have criticized it for its massive energy demands and over concerns about how it will affect people living nearby in Richland Parish.

The project, announced a year ago, will take up the space equivalent to about 70 football fields. Estimates are that the facility will draw twice the power that the city of New Orleans uses on a hot summer day.

Meta promises more than 5,000 construction jobs and 500 permanent jobs. The power plants will likely employ another 50 people.

Louisiana’s Public Service Commission voted to approve the project in August.

Marsh, a 27-year Entergy veteran, said the data center and its power plants are part of an industrial boom along the Gulf Coast — and particularly on the Interstate-20 corridor connecting Shreveport to Jackson, Mississippi — that has boosted the utility’s annual growth from 5% a year to about 13%.

“As we look out to 2050, we think we could triple or quadruple our sales,” he said. “There's just a lot going on out there.”

To meet the increased demand, Marsh said, Entergy will have to invest in a variety of power generation methods, including nuclear.

Marsh, who is chair of the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, said the country needs to maintain its existing power plants and ease regulations so more can come online.

“Nuclear safety is something that is very important, but it has been overdone,"" he said. ""One-in-a-million years type standards on things could be very, very expensive and not really generate much incremental safety.”

The Energy Forum comes at a time of significant changes in the nation's energy policy, when the Trump Administration has moved away from clean energy initiatives and promoted increasing domestic fossil fuel production.

Marsh's remarks echoed others at the event, where the focus has shifted away from clean energy in favor of a more pragmatic approach. Marsh said Entergy is prioritizing affordability, reliability and resilience.

“Some of the areas that we serve are some of the most economically disadvantaged areas of the country,"" he said. ""And a lot of our large industrial customers are competing in a global commodity market, so if our prices were to go shooting upward, that could end their ability to compete in our service territory.”

""By and large, the world is not focused on sustainability. Less so today than it was two years ago, to be sure,"" he added. ""But it is something that is going to come back around. That's what we believe.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/9f/49f50347-dcc4-4292-8637-dc9fd2d08cd4/68c1ffbda774f.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-11 18:00:23.576341

How to build more wind energy, faster WindEurope welcomes the European Commission’s push to accelerate the build-out of home-grown, competitive wind energy.
To resolve that, National Governments need to remove the four main obstacles to new wind energy projects.","In her annual State of the Union address EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted the new geopolitical reality based on hard power. To keep its place in this new world order, Europe needs to take control of the energies and technologies which fuel its economy. Von der Leyen termed it “Europe’s independence moment”.

Amid this increasing geopolitical uncertainty, she doubled down on the urgent need to implement Europe’s Clean Industrial Deal. “This transformation is central to our push for independence”, von der Leyen said. She said international “dependencies are ruthlessly weaponised” and pledged to “get rid of dirty Russian fossil fuels completely”.

Von der Leyen’s steer was clear: to become less dependent on international developments, Europe’s economy must become more European. She pledged to “massively invest in digital and clean tech”. She repeated her determination to ramp up clean tech manufacturing in Europe and stressed that urgent action was needed to maintain Europe’s global clean tech leadership. And she committed to work on the completion of the EU Single Market via a new Roadmap to 2028.

“The EU Commission is clear: we need more home-grown wind energy. It boosts energy security. It means lower energy bills for consumers. It strengthens our industrial competitiveness. Europe’s wind industry and its 400,000 workers are ready to step up to the task”, says WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson.

Direct electrification and grids

The EU Commission President also reaffirmed her determination to strengthen the direct electrification of Europe’s economy, among other things with a new electric vehicle initiative and a Battery Booster Package.

But most crucially, Europe needs to invest in its grid infrastructure and interconnections. Electricity grids are the foundation for any electrification effort. The Commission President reminded a European Grids Package is on the way before the end of this year. And announced a new European Energy Highways initiative which will identify eight critical cross-border grid bottlenecks and bring together politicians and industry to resolve them.

Bringing electricity prices down for citizens and companies

Europe is facing a cost-of-living crisis – fuelled by spiralling costs for electricity and housing. “We know what brings electricity prices down”, von der Leyen insisted: “domestically produced clean tech.” She also stressed the critical role an accelerated deployment of renewables plays for Europe’s wider economic competitiveness. Competitive electricity prices are key to ensuring energy-intensive industries keep producing in Europe.

More demand for clean tech

To create more demand for domestically produced clean tech von der Leyen announced the introduction of a new “made in Europe” criterion in public procurement procedures as well as an Industrial Accelerator Act for key clean technologies.

How to build more wind energy, faster

WindEurope welcomes the European Commission’s push to accelerate the build-out of home-grown, competitive wind energy. But in the first half of 2025 the EU only built 5.3 GW of new wind, less than expected and not nearly enough to deliver the EU’s 2030 energy security and climate targets.

To resolve that, National Governments need to remove the four main obstacles to new wind energy projects. They must:

speed up permitting by ruthlessly implementing the excellent Renewable Energy Directive (REDIII);

optimise and expand Europe’s electricity grid and interconnections;

remove all barriers to direct electrification; and

de-risk wind energy auctions with a stable pipeline of two-sided Contracts for Difference (CfD) auctions.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ursula-von-der-leyen-speech-state-of-eu-union-2025.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 15:00:35.637335

The petition argues that the panel’s opinion contradicts settled jurisprudence and misconstrues the plaintiffs’ constitutional claim.
“While the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees’ constitutional claim, that claim is meritless,” the opinion states.
But we have long rejected the idea that the APA’s general bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract terminations to a parallel review scheme in district court,” Rao and Katsas wrote.
The plaintiffs requested a rehearing en banc – meaning all judges of that particular court would have to hear the case.","Nonprofit recipients of $14 billion in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants that were frozen by the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year filed a rehearing petition late Wednesday after a U.S. Court of Appeals panel upheld the freeze.

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Tanya Chutkan granted an injunction against the freeze in April, ruling that the EPA had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in attempting to revoke the funding, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a stay on that ruling soon after.

The plaintiffs named in the rehearing petition include the Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. The petition argues that the panel’s opinion contradicts settled jurisprudence and misconstrues the plaintiffs’ constitutional claim.

The appeals court issued its 2-1 ruling upholding the freeze on Sept. 2, saying, “The district court erred in concluding the grantees are likely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, and constitutional claims.”

The majority opinion aligns with the Trump administration’s arguments to freeze GGRF funding disbursed by the Inflation Reduction Act, citing public criticism about the “sheer scale of the grant program and the method of allocating billions of dollars,” and stating, “The month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements — with no apparent consideration from the grantees — to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.”

The opinion concludes that the dispute in this case is contractual, not constitutional, and should be heard in the Court of Federal Claims — thus Chutkan lacked the jurisdiction to rule on the issue.

“While the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees’ constitutional claim, that claim is meritless,” the opinion states. “Moreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which on behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and management of this multi-billion-dollar fund.”

The majority opinion was filed by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump, Judge Neomi Rao and Judge Gregory Katsas.

“The grantees insist the [Administrative Procedure Act] gives them an independent right to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract terminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA’s general bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract terminations to a parallel review scheme in district court,” Rao and Katsas wrote.

The EPA said in a release responding to the panel’s decision that it was “fantastic to see reason prevail in the court system ... The gold bar recipients were wrong about jurisdiction all along and wrong to act so entitled to these precious public funds that belong to hardworking American taxpayers.”

The “gold bar” language refers to a covert video recorded of a Biden administration EPA adviser having a conversation in a bar in which he likens the administration’s efforts to disburse funds before Trump’s inauguration to throwing gold bars off the edge of the Titanic. The adviser’s lawyer has said he was not referring to the GGRF in his comments.

The plaintiffs requested a rehearing en banc – meaning all judges of that particular court would have to hear the case.

The panel’s dissenting judge, Nina Pillard, was appointed by President Barack Obama. Of the court’s 15 judges, four are Obama appointees, three are Biden appointees, three are Trump appointees, one is an appointee of President George H.W.

Community solar power has many benefits and it provides a flexible option for some people in the event homeowners can’t afford their own solar power systems or utilities are not going to develop their own solar power systems. Community solar power can also be used in rural and farming areas. (About 7 months ago, I conducted an interview with some insights about how solar power and energy storage can help Texas farmers.)

The team at Farmers Powering Communities answered some questions for CleanTechnica.

What is Reactivate and what is Farmers Powering Communities?

Reactivate, an Invenergy company, is a mission-driven organization that develops, owns, and operates renewable energy solutions designed to improve quality of life for communities across the country — with a focus on delivering meaningful benefits to working-class people. Reactivate’s portfolio includes community solar, commercial and industrial solar, small utility-scale solar, energy storage, and EV charging projects, all developed with an emphasis on supporting communities burdened by high energy costs. Guided by a vision in which everyone benefits from renewable energy, Reactivate delivers economic, social, and environmental advantages by helping residents and businesses reduce energy expenses, creating local jobs, driving economic growth, strengthening grid resilience.

Farmers Powering Communities is a newly formed partnership between American Farmland Trust, Reactivate, and Edelen Renewables Community Solar. FPC’s mission is to connect those working to feed the planet with those powering America, ensuring solar development is deployed to maximize benefits for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. The partnership will focus on developing distributed generation projects that serve working-class communities, with project size guided by land characteristics and energy needs.

This new partnership builds on AFT’s growing national Smart Solar℠ network and will initially focus on regions where farmland preservation and clean energy demand are both urgent priorities.

Why is it important to bring community solar projects to American farmers and rural communities?

Across the country, many rural communities face high energy costs and limited access to affordable, reliable power. Reactivate helps close these gaps by delivering community solar projects that guarantee bill savings, support local economies, and enhance grid reliability. Community solar is a flexible energy solution that allows anyone with an electric bill to subscribe to locally generated solar power — offering consumers more choice, encouraging competition in the energy market, and strengthening the grid. These projects typically range up to 5 MW in size and occupy 10–30 acres, making them well-suited for rural settings. Community solar installations can be ground-mounted, co-located with existing crops, placed on rooftops, or built on otherwise unusable land. When sited on farmland, they are designed to preserve the land for future agricultural use — helping protect family farms while generating clean energy and economic value.

How can Farmers Powering Communities advance agrivoltaics?

FPC is unique among solar companies because it is rooted in American Farmland Trust’s Smart Solar℠ principles. Smart Solar℠ refers to solar projects that meet three main, equally important goals:

(1) safeguarding land well-suited for farming and ranching, (2) strengthening farm viability, and (3) accelerating solar energy development. Smart Solar promotes the use of agrivoltaics — the intentional combination of solar energy generation and agricultural production on the same piece of land — as a key strategy for accomplishing these goals.

FPC is committed to working with landowners to ensure that projects are designed and built in a manner that facilitates the continued production of agricultural products on land where projects are sited. Not as an afterthought, but as a priority from day one.

What are some examples of locally generated, accessible energy solutions?

Reactivate has a portfolio of community solar projects across Illinois and New York that completed construction in 2024. This example portfolio will help approximately 5,000 households along with area non-profits, businesses, and a public school district save a minimum of 20% on their monthly electricity costs. Approximately 90% of the subscriber households qualify as working-class. Total subscriber savings are projected to exceed $17 million dollars over the projects’ useful lives.

Do community solar projects create local jobs?

Yes, community solar projects create local jobs, especially during the construction and maintenance phases of the project development.

How can they generate tax revenue and drive economic growth in local communities?

Community solar projects contribute directly to local and state economies by generating tax revenue through multiple channels — including property taxes on the solar installation, sales taxes on equipment, and, in some states, production-based taxes tied to energy output. These funds strengthen local budgets and can be reinvested in essential public services such as schools, roads, and emergency services — offsetting costs and improving quality of life. Beyond tax revenue, Reactivate prioritizes working with local small businesses throughout project development, creating opportunities for contractors, suppliers, and service providers. Once operational, community solar helps residents save on their energy bills, increasing disposable income that can be spent locally — fueling small businesses and contributing to a more vibrant, resilient economy.

Can solar power help farmers stay on their family farms? If so, how?

Absolutely. Since 1981, the U.S. has lost over 559,000 farmers and ranchers, mostly small and mid-sized operations. Today, half of all farm families report negative farm income, and 90% earn most of their income off the farm. These numbers tell a sobering story, but they also point to a powerful opportunity.

By intentionally designing solar to benefit working farms while meeting America’s rapidly growing need for energy, we can create new revenue streams, reduce operational costs, and build resilience during these trying times. Solar leases offer long-term reliable income streams that can help create the economic conditions for farm families to not only stay on their land, but to invest in their operations and help the next generation plan for their future. This is not about replacing agriculture with solar. It’s about adding a revenue generation tool that can build long-term, generational farm viability. At American Farmland Trust, we talk to farmers every day who are harnessing these new opportunities made possible by solar.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-10-2025-08_43_34-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-09-11 13:02:16.933954

Total hydro generation fell to 27 TWh – the lowest value since August 2021 – as reduced rainfall worsened Brazil’s already low dry-season output.

Clean power meets fast-rising demand in Brazil

Brazil’s build-out of wind and solar power has been fast enough to meet and exceed growth in electricity demand over the last decade. This has reduced the need for additional fossil generation and prevented an increase in power sector emissions.

As reported in Ember’s Global Electricity Review 2025 earlier this year, Brazil’s emissions from electricity generation peaked in 2014 at 114 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2). Between 2014 and 2024, wind and solar increased fifteenfold, adding 168 TWh – enough to exceed demand growth. As a result, despite demand growing by 137 TWh (+22%) over the same period, fossil generation fell by 64 TWh (-45%). Consequently, power sector emissions declined by 31% to reach 79 MtCO2 in 2024.

Sustained clean power build-out can meet future demand

Brazil’s fast-rising demand presents both an opportunity and a challenge: the opportunity, meet this with cheap, clean sources like solar and wind; the challenge – ensure that policy and investment are aligned to support this.

Brazil’s demand growth has been above-average in the last two years, with 4.8% and 5.3% in 2023 and 2024 respectively, compared to an average of 2.0% in the previous decade. Demand growth is expected to continue in the coming years, with some estimates showing growth of 3.4% per year until 2030.

The continued build-out of clean power at pace can help avoid a rise in costly imports of coal and gas to meet rising power demand. However, solar capacity additions slowed in the first half of 2025 with 7.1 GW installed compared to 9.9 GW in the first half of 2024, as issues such as grid-connection queues and congestion, regulatory uncertainty and reduced incentives put downward pressure on the Brazilian solar market. Planned auctions for transmission lines and new rules on solar compensation aim at reducing the complexity and barriers for wind and solar deployment and could once more accelerate their build-out.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/09/1-55-Wind-mills-in-Brazil.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 14:01:31.537208

Consumers Energy plans to sell its 13 aging and unprofitable Michigan hydropower dams to a subsidiary of a Maryland private equity firm for a dollar apiece, in a deal that would ensure their continued existence for the next three decades.

Company officials announced Tuesday that Delaware-based Confluence Hydro LLC, which formed in June and registered to do business in Michigan in August, plans to sell the dams’ electricity back to Consumers at an unspecified price.

Consumers has been publicly pondering a sale of its 13 hydroelectric dams in the Au Sable, Manistee, Muskegon, Grand and Kalamazoo rivers for the past three years, seeking a way out of a hydropower business that generates paltry power at a $152 million net annual loss.

The company also considered keeping or demolishing the dams, but the sale emerged as “the most cost effective for customers,” said Sri Maddipati, Consumers’ president of electric supply.

Maddipati declined to offer specifics, saying more financial details will emerge as Consumers seeks federal and state approval for the proposed sale.

That process, including reviews by both the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Michigan Public Service Commission, could take up to 18 months. If both entities sign off, Consumers officials said a sale could close in late 2026 or early 2027.

Confluence is a subsidiary of Hull Street Energy, a Maryland-based private equity firm founded in 2014 that invests in natural gas plants, dams and other power generating infrastructure across the country.

Its stated mission is to “rebuild and modernize the North American hydroelectric fleet” to provide “safe, reliable power to the electric grid for generations to come.”

“We bring specialized expertise to modernizing hydro dams, many of which suffer from under investment and poor performance,” said Ed Quinn, the company’s chief executive officer, during a webinar announcing the deal.

After marketing the impoundments to potential buyers virtually for free, Consumers announced in June that it was in negotiations with an unnamed buyer.

Nearby residents and dam safety advocates have expressed concern about the possibility of a sale to a private owner, citing Michigan utilities’ long history of offloading old and unprofitable dams onto new owners who can’t afford to maintain them. Such arrangements have repeatedly shifted safety risks and financial costs onto the public.

Consumers officials sought to allay those concerns on Tuesday, calling safety “a top priority” in the sale.

“We have used this process to find a buyer who is similarly committed to safety,” said Jean Kang, Consumers’ vice president of generation operations.

After the privately-owned and poorly-maintained Midland dams failed in 2020, both federal and state officials considered reforms including stricter dam safety standards and more rigorous financial vetting of dam buyers. They have acted on almost none of them.

News of the plan to keep the dams intact drew cheers from nearby residents, who had feared that Consumers would demolish the dams and drain impoundments that have become valuable recreational lakes.

“We think this is good news,” said Coco Soodek, president of the association representing residents on Lake Allegan, a reservoir impounded by Consumers’ Calkins Bridge Dam in the Kalamazoo River.

But the plan drew suspicion from dam safety and fish advocates who see demolition as a better option.

“This can keeps getting kicked down the road,” said Bob Stuber, executive director of the Michigan Hydro Relicensing Coalition. “These dams are aging infrastructure, and sooner or later, they’ve got to be dealt with.”

While they agree on little else, both Soodek and Stuber said they worry about a private equity firm owning such important pieces of infrastructure.

While Soodek said she has heard good things about the prospective new owners, “I haven’t seen evidence that care for the community and private equity profit motives coexist consistently.”

Why the sale?

Built about a century ago before the era of large power plants and solar farms, the dams now produce just 1% of Consumers’ electricity, at nine times the cost of the company’s next-most-expensive power source.

Against that bad financial math, Consumers has spent recent decades whittling down its dam inventory from more than 90 to just 13 today.

The remaining dams are Michigan’s largest, plugging up rivers to produce artificial lakes that have become prized fixtures on the landscape. People have built homes along the shore, and communities have built tourism economies around boating, swimming and fishing in the reservoirs.

Recreation at the impoundments creates 1,420 direct jobs and $140 million in gross domestic product, according to a survey from Public Sector Consultants, and the reservoirs raise nearby property values by a combined $130 million.

But the dams also superheat and fragment rivers while trapping sediment in the reservoirs, harming migratory and coldwater fish like sturgeon, trout and salmon. Advocates of free-flowing rivers argue that removing the dams would also support tourism and recreation.

Consumers officials have previously estimated that demolishing them would save $781 million compared to keeping them operational under Consumers’ ownership. While they said Tuesday that a sale would present an even better deal for customers, they declined to offer details.

A copy of the letter can be found here. Text of the letter can be found below.

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

We write to express our serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) oversight of underground injection control (UIC) wells used for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Recent events, including the substantial well failures at the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Class VI injection well facility in Decatur, Illinois, and a pattern of well failures and non-compliance at Class II injection wells in Texas, demonstrate regulatory gaps that threaten underground sources of drinking water and warrant immediate EPA action. The events highlight systemic issues with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and its regulation, raising serious concerns about the safety and viability of CCS.

On August 13, 2025, EPA issued an Administrative Order on Consent to Archer Daniels Midland for these violations, confirming that injected CO2 and brine migrated into an unauthorized underground formation. While the order acknowledges breaches of core safeguards, it imposes no penalties, does not suspend ADM’s permit, and leaves in place the weak rules that allowed this incident to occur. This underscores the urgent need for EPA to strengthen its Class VI oversight, update regulations, and halt additional injections until it can ensure such leaks will not endanger drinking water.

ADM Decatur Leak and Abandoned-Well Failures

In March 2024, ADM identified a subsurface CO2 leak from its Illinois Class VI injection well facility caused by corrosion at a monitoring well.This followed years of monitoring equipment failures, dating back to 2020. In October 2024, ADM reported a second subsurface leak connected to another monitoring well. Concerns have been raised that other existing wells in the vicinity of the well failures could serve as vectors for the migration of CO2 into Lake Decatur, the primary source of drinking water for 80,000 people in central Illinois.

EPA notified injection well applicants in June 2024 that steel commonly used by the industry is prone to corrosion in the presence of CO2, but did not take steps to notify the public about the leak and threats to drinking water sources. It was ultimately media reports that made the public aware of these concerns, which surfaced five months after the leak was disclosed and two months after EPA notified pending permit applicants.

Broader Texas Class II Noncompliance

Following the public reporting regarding the ADM facility, EPA was made aware of well failures throughout Texas in an October 2024 letter highlighting:

a sudden increase in significant non-compliance violations starting in 2011;

and a higher percentage of Class II CO2 injection wells failing one or more mechanical integrity tests relative to other Class II wells.

Class II wells make up thousands of potential injection sites across the country used to extract oil by injecting CO2 deep into these formations. The practice of injecting CO2 into these wells carries many of the same risks associated with Class VI wells used for CCS; however, the regulations governing Class II wells are less stringent, posing an even greater risk of leaks.

Staffing and Programmatic Cuts at EPA

The Republican congressional leadership is moving forward with plans to cut EPA’s budget by 23%, on top of 3,700 staff who are no longer working at EPA since January of this year. These cuts raise grave concerns about EPA’s ability to comply with its mandate to protect human health and the environment. These cuts, moreover, compound specific concerns we have regarding EPA’s ability to effectively provide oversight and accountability for the UIC program, including ensuring compliance by states that have primacy over Class VI and Class II injection wells.

Concerns with Well Blowouts

Due to changes in the tax code under the recent budget bill, which increased subsidies for the use of CO2 for oil extraction, there are significant concerns with the potential impacts of CO2 well blowouts, uncontrolled releases of CO2 from Class II and Class VI wells, particularly in areas with a long history of oil drilling. Just as with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (3.19 million barrels over 87 days) and the Aliso Canyon methane blowout (109,000 metric tons from October 2015 to February 2016), CO2 wells can catastrophically fail.

CO2 blowouts pose particular risks due to the rapid expansion of supercritical CO2 that would occur during a blowout, as well as the extreme temperatures and pressures present in CO2 wells. Given the thousands of legacy oil and gas wells, especially along the Gulf Coast, we are concerned that a major CO2 blowout, with uncontrolled releases far from an injection site, could threaten the safety of nearby communities if the blowout reaches the surface.

Moratorium on CO2 Injections

We urge EPA to exercise its broad authority to protect sources of drinking water from “imminent and substantial endangerment” under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. §300i) by:

halting approval of Class II and Class VI wells;

halting approval of primacy applications;

directing existing injection well operators to cease injections;

directing states with primacy to ensure compliance with this EPA objective; and

keeping these restrictions in place until such time that EPA is able to:

ensure that CO2 is not leaking from wells;

update regulations to ensure that the integrity of injection well operations is sufficient to protect drinking water sources; and

ensure adequate staffing to provide direct oversight of injection wells to ensure protection of drinking water sources.

We also ask that you respond to the following questions by November 1 in order to allow Congress to provide resources to EPA in the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations legislation to ensure adequate protection for drinking water sources from the injection of CO2:

How has EPA changed permitting of Class II and Class VI wells in light of the deficiencies discovered at the ADM facility?

How has EPA revised its permit-review protocols and state primacy-application evaluations to prevent similar oversights in states with extensive oil-and-gas histories, including Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Alaska?

How was a permit issued to ADM without accurate subsurface mapping, and what steps has EPA taken to require comprehensive historical-well surveys prior to permit approvals?

Given that steel used in existing wells is prone to corrosion, what steps has EPA taken to ensure that well equipment at existing Class II and Class VI wells is not corroding and posing a threat to drinking water?

What steps has EPA taken to ensure that injection well operators are not using steel that is prone to corrosion in CO2 injection wells?

Given that standard monitoring equipment was unable to detect a second leak at the ADM injection site, how has EPA changed monitoring protocols to ensure detection of future leaks?

Is EPA aware of other leaks or well failures at Class II or Class VI wells?

Why did EPA fail to notify the public about the leak, even while it notified the industry of issues with corrosion of steel in injection wells?

What steps has EPA taken to ensure that states with primacy over Class II and Class VI wells are updating monitoring, oversight, and permitting in light of revelations from the Texas and ADM well failures?

To what extent are staff positions responsible for the monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 injection wells no longer filled at EPA headquarters and regional offices?

Can you provide an assessment of staffing changes within EPA’s UIC and SDWA enforcement offices over the past five years?

Can you provide an evaluation of how resource constraints have affected permit reviews, inspections, and enforcement actions at EPA in general and for the UIC program specifically?

What analyses or modeling has EPA conducted or is planning to conduct to quantify the likelihood and potential consequences of CO2 well blowouts in various environments?

What steps does EPA take to ensure that if a catastrophic blowout were to occur, well operators would be able quickly to identify and plug the well and prevent drinking water contamination?

We stand ready to work with EPA to safeguard our drinking water and public health. The ADM order makes clear that current safeguards are insufficient to prevent dangerous CO2 migration, even under direct EPA oversight. Without stronger rules, robust enforcement, and adequate staffing, approving or operating additional Class II and Class VI wells risks repeating these failures and putting drinking water supplies at grave risk.

We request a written response to each of the points above and look forward to your prompt engagement on this urgent matter. Please have your staff contact Nikki Roy (nikki.roy@mail.house.gov) on Rep. Casten’s staff with questions.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-11 15:04:04+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Down to the wire: California lawmakers announce last-minute climate and energy package,"Hayley Smith, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-09-11/down-to-the-wire-california-lawmakers-announce-last-minute-climate-and-energy-deal,"After months of negotiation, California legislative leaders on Wednesday reached an eleventh-hour agreement on a suite of closely watched climate and energy bills.
Among the most prominent items is the extension of California’s nation-leading cap-and-trade program beyond its 2030 expiration date to 2045.
“It leaves billions of dollars on the table that could have supported climate solutions and addressed the state’s affordability challenges.
“It’s just going to be disastrous for California,” said Loretta Lynch, former president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
However, some advocacy groups were upset by what wasn’t included in the package — including “fixes” to the state’s overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act.","After months of negotiation, California legislative leaders on Wednesday reached an eleventh-hour agreement on a suite of closely watched climate and energy bills.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) announced the deal just days before the the legislative session ends on Friday. It includes reauthorization of California’s signature cap-and-trade program and the expansion of a regional electricity market, among other items.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said in a statement.

There were wins and losses for energy and environmental groups in the package, which is expected to pass by the end of the week before moving to Newsom’s desk for his signature.

Among the most prominent items is the extension of California’s nation-leading cap-and-trade program beyond its 2030 expiration date to 2045. The program sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows large polluters to buy and sell unused emission allowances at quarterly auctions.

Cap-and-trade is seen as crucial for California to comply with its climate goals — including reaching carbon neutrality by 2045 — and also brings in billions in revenue that helps fund state climate efforts such as the high-speed rail and safe drinking water programs. Newsom for months had been pushing for the program to be reauthorized largely in its current form, while environmental groups were hoping to see changes in how the program is run and where the money is spent.

Revised language released Wednesday, including Senate Bill 840 and Assembly Bill 1207, includes some but not all of the changes they had hoped for, such as prioritized funding for nature-based climate solutions and a proposal to provide direct consumer rebates from the California Climate Mitigation Fund to help address affordability concerns.

“By aligning the future of cap-and-trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible,” said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director with the nonprofit Environmental Defend, who urged lawmakers to pass the bill.

But there are also “missed opportunities,” according to the nonprofit group the Climate Center, including the preservation of free allowances for the oil and gas industry — permits to pollute so that businesses are not at a disadvantage against competitors in other states.

“Overall, this proposal is better than a straight reauthorization of the cap-and-trade program, but not by much,” said Ryan Schleeter, the Climate Center’s communications director. “It leaves billions of dollars on the table that could have supported climate solutions and addressed the state’s affordability challenges. California has a lot more work to do to shift the financial burden of the climate crisis from taxpayers to the wealthy, polluting corporations responsible.”

Also included in the package was AB 825, which creates a pathway for California to participate in a regional electricity market. If passed, the bill would expand partnership with other Western states to buy and sell more clean power in a move supporters say will improve grid reliability and save money for ratepayers.

“This historic agreement puts California on a pathway with Western states to provide cleaner, cheaper, more reliable energy,” Rivas said in a statement. “It’s a landmark affordability agreement that will amount to billions of dollars in savings for Californians.”

Some supporters have argued that improved collaboration across the West will help accelerate climate progress, while opponents fear that California would yield control of its power grid to out-of-state authorities, including the federal government.

“It’s just going to be disastrous for California,” said Loretta Lynch, former president of the California Public Utilities Commission. Among other concerns, Lynch said the bill would eliminate all statutory requirements that the California Independent System Operator, run its electricity market consistent with the state’s public health and environmental laws, and would weaken the state’s ability to withdraw from the regional plan if problems arise.

Other groups said the language released Wednesday addresses many concerns and helps protect California’s interests.

“This proposal clears the way to stand up energy markets that can save Californians real money,” Alex Jackson, director of the nonprofit American Clean Power California, said in a statement. “It means we can work with our neighbors to ensure the West has the affordable, reliable, clean power needed to meet surging demand.”

Also included in Wednesday’s package was SB 352, which would establish an air pollution monitoring program in some of the state’s most heavily polluted communities, and SB 254, which would replenish the state’s wildfire liability fund to help cover wildfire damage and finance mitigation efforts, among other items.

“This bold legislative package will deliver for every corner of the Golden State on energy affordability and wildfire prevention, expand clean drinking water to tens of thousands and it also cements historic agreements on California’s signature climate policies,” McGuire said in a statement.

However, some advocacy groups were upset by what wasn’t included in the package — including “fixes” to the state’s overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act. That overhaul eases new construction in the state. Meanwhile, another bill supported by many environmental groups that would have created a Climate Superfund to hold fossil fuel companies liable for damage caused by their emissions was pushed to next year.

Perhaps most controversial in the package is SB 237, a bill that could help increase the state’s oil production in what lawmakers say is an effort to stabilize the market and gird against future gasoline price spikes. It follows major announcements this year from the oil companies Phillips 66 and Valero that they were shutting down two big refineries in the state.

In something of a compromise, the bill would streamline environmental approvals for new oil wells in Kern County but make it more difficult for companies to get approval to drill off the coast.

In a statement, the activist group Campaign for a Safe and Healthy California expressed concern about the legislation, which it said was “crammed in the Legislature’s last 72 hours,” and urged lawmakers to reject the proposal.

“The transition from oil is well underway in California and across the world, with refineries closing from Texas to Los Angeles,” the statement said. “But in California, Big Oil is using the threat of refinery closures as a bargaining chip to pressure lawmakers into approving more drilling.”

,Indiana and Evs,2025-09-11 15:01:59+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Transportation plan casts wide net for zero emissions in Chicago region,Doug Ross,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/09/11/transportation-plan-casts-wide-net-for-zero-emissions-in-chicago-region/,"A comprehensive climate action plan to achieve net-zero emissions covering 13 counties in the Chicago area is nearing completion.
The goal is to reduce gross greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 85% by 2050 within the greater Chicago area.
2050 isn’t far away, but already the region has made progress toward that goal, Luther said.
Among the surprises Luther offered Tuesday was that passenger vehicles are the largest source of transportation emissions, ahead of freight vehicles.
For the transportation sector, the residual emissions are primarily from off-road vehicles if the plan is successful, she said.","A comprehensive climate action plan to achieve net-zero emissions covering 13 counties in the Chicago area is nearing completion. The plan covers the area from Kenosha County in Wisconsin to LaPorte County.

The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus and the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission are working together to complete the plan before the Dec. 1 deadline.

Kathy Luther, director of environmental programs at NIRPC, briefed the agency’s Transportation Committee about progress on the plan Tuesday.

The goal is to reduce gross greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 85% by 2050 within the greater Chicago area. Carbon sequestration is factored in when calculating net emissions.

2050 isn’t far away, but already the region has made progress toward that goal, Luther said.

In 2020, emissions were at 192.92 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, but within five years they had dropped to 154.29.

Of the 152 million metric tons emitted in the 13-county region, Indiana’s Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties account for 54.5 million metric tons, or about 35.8%, Luther said.

Transportation accounts for 26% of those emissions, with industry at 36% and buildings at 35%. Agriculture, wastewater treatment and waste management account for another 3%.

Hitting the reduction goal by 2050 means cutting emissions by another 65%, Luther said.

For the transportation sector, hitting that goal means accelerating the move toward electric vehicles, increasing fuel efficiency and adopting low-carbon fuels, reducing travel demand, increasing traffic flows, increasing transit ridership and increasing use of bicycles and other means of active transportation.

That’s easier said than done, especially given the current political climate in the Trump administration, which is seeing Biden-era policies being rolled back or reversed.

Luther said assuming the current federal policies remain in place, emissions would be reduced by 36%. With state and local actions to reduce emissions, the reduction would be 61%. Implementing every aspect of the plan now being developed would see emissions drop enough to hit the goal of an 85% reduction.

Increasing the number of electric vehicles isn’t just limited to replacing internal combustion engines on passenger cars, pickups and SUVs. It also means electrification of off-road vehicles, marine vessels and locomotives.

For commuter trains, electrification began decades ago as a way to reduce pollution in Chicago. But carrying freight requires a lot more power than carrying riders. That’s going to be a challenge for railroads.

And for off-road vehicles and marine vessels, access to recharging stations can be an issue.

California is taking aggressive steps to reduce emissions, including requiring all new light-duty vehicles sold to be either electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids by 2035. That’s driving manufacturers to meet those standards not just for vehicles intended for sale in California but also nationwide.

California is also requiring new lawn and landscaping equipment and off-road vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035.

In Illinois, the CTA plans to switch to electric buses, starting with all new buses purchased in 2026 and completing the conversion by 2040.

An Illinois law also requires 100% of school bus fleets to be electric by 2035, beginning with buses purchased in 2028 and beyond.

Chicago plans for all municipal fleets to be electric by 2035.

Among the surprises Luther offered Tuesday was that passenger vehicles are the largest source of transportation emissions, ahead of freight vehicles. The latter, while significant, is also harder to decarbonize.

Reaching all-electric for new vehicles by 2035 is critical to meeting the 2050 goal, Luther said.

For the transportation sector, the residual emissions are primarily from off-road vehicles if the plan is successful, she said.

Achieving these goals won’t be cheap.

For Gary Public Transportation Co., a large infusion of local cash would be needed to convert the fleet to electric, Planning, Marketing and Grants Planner David Wright said. Assuming prices come back down, an electric bus could cost $900,000.

Additional charging stations, including at the Lake County Government Center, would also be necessary to keep the buses running, he said.

Luther hopes to have a draft of the comprehensive climate action plan ready by late October.

Under its community solar program—now a permanent fixture after a successful three-year pilot—New Jersey has committed to adding 3,000 megawatts of new community solar capacity by 2029.","KEARNY, N.J.—From the second row of a fluorescent-lit room, Kavone Little, 38, aims his monopod-mounted phone to the front as he smiles ear to ear. He presses the record button.

Broad-shouldered, quick with riffs and smiling with easy charm, Little is an online streamer. He documents his life in New Jersey and posts the videos online. Playing kickball, dancing in the street, hanging out with friends. He ends his captions with hashtags such as #contentking, #god1st and #hardwork.

His video for the day on July 17: his graduation.

He spent seven weeks this summer in a training program for formerly incarcerated people, learning how to install solar panels to help them reenter the workforce.

“I feel accomplished. Feeling blessed. Feeling stronger than ever,” said Kavone, who served 16 months before his release in 2024.

Kavone is one of 11 men who completed the program hosted by the nonprofit New Jersey Reentry Corporation (NJRC). A team from Hudson County Community College (HCCC) and solar developer Solar One led the course, which included solar installation, construction basics and work readiness and safety—each module providing them a certification.

In total, NJRC has trained over 500 people for various skills, including welding, construction, cooking, solar panel installations and even sales. Trainees are enrolled for free on a first-come, first-served basis. All they need to do is show up.

“With every program we try to base it on a couple things. A, is this an in-demand occupation that we could see being sustainable for the foreseeable future? And B, do we have the interest? We saw that there were a lot of individuals that were interested in solar training,” said Michael Hayek, the facility director of NJRC’s Kearny headquarters.

The program is a springboard to get “reintegrated right” and to bring back “structure” to the lives of former inmates, said Albert Williams, a coordinator with HCCC.

“It’s not just important for me,” said Kavone. “This is important for most men who are trying to have a second chance in life. It gives us the ability to have these skills to go into the world and feel confident about what we know and what we believe in and where we want to go for the rest of our lives.”

Kavone hoped to earn money from solar panel installations to start his dream of opening his own business: an ice cream shop in his hometown of Paterson in the northern edge of New Jersey. It’s a bet he placed on renewable energy.

“If you’re looking, they’re trying to change everything into solar. They want everything to be run by solar,” Kavone said.

Kavone’s observation is not unfounded.

Despite being the fifth-smallest state in land area, New Jersey ranks eleventh among all states in solar power capacity, according Solar Energy Industries Association data. For the past nine years, the state has seen an average of about 17,000 residential annual rooftop solar panel installations, according to data from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). Solar panel installers like Kavone are contracted to complete those installations.

But President Donald Trump sees a different future for energy in America, where the federal government holds oil and gas in full embrace as it walks away from renewable energy commitments made by the Biden administration.

Trump removed the industry-shaping tax credits meant to encourage the construction of more renewable energy projects across the country, a credit that helped developers fund about a third of each of their projects. Then, in early August, a couple of weeks after Kavone graduated, President Trump canceled the Biden-era Solar For All incentive program, which sought to award $7 billion to states to subsidize solar panel installations in low-income communities—the same communities Kavone hoped to serve with his new certification.

“No doubt, this withdrawal of funds and the clean energy ban coming from the Trump administration is going to be a major setback. It’s going to increase energy prices. It’s going to increase air pollution. It’s going to kill New Jersey jobs,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

The federal government allotted $156 million to New Jersey through the BPU. The Garden State also stood to benefit from one multistate and one national grant worth about $500 million combined. The BPU planned to use the money for residential and community solar projects as well as for training people to work in the renewable energy industry.

“These projects are now in jeopardy, and NJBPU is currently reviewing its options,” the NJBPU said in a statement.

The BPU estimated that, in New Jersey, about 22,000 low-income households could have saved $400 annually on energy bills with solar panels that would have cut about 240,000 tons of carbon emissions.

These policy earthquakes emanating from Washington have left solar companies in “an air of gloom,” said Lyle Rawlings, president of Advanced Solar Products, which built large-scale projects from Virginia to Maine and as far west as Ohio.

“Companies like mine and the others that we’ve been meeting regularly are reeling from all of this and wondering how we can maintain our current staffing, let alone hire these new people who are being trained,” said Rawlings.

With the tax incentives for residential solar ending by January 2026 and commercial and larger-scale solar projects ending by July 2026, Rawlings said he’s seeing a rush to build to qualify for these incentives, which require companies to show they’ve at least started construction by the deadlines.

After which, Rawlings said, is a cliff.

With the incentives gone, fewer people will want to install panels on top of their homes and companies now have fewer projects that they could fund without federal dollars.

But the impact of these solar incentive clawbacks will vary from state to state, said Joe Henri, a senior vice president at Dimension, a leading community solar developer. Henri said New Jersey is “in better shape than many places” because of the state’s incentive programs.

“Meanwhile, states like California that pegged their community solar plans to federal dollars are falling behind. More governors should follow New Jersey’s lead and create strong state programs that lower bills and create good local jobs,” Henri said.

New Jersey prides itself for maintaining a diverse set of incentive programs for solar. Under its community solar program—now a permanent fixture after a successful three-year pilot—New Jersey has committed to adding 3,000 megawatts of new community solar capacity by 2029. One megawatt can power roughly 150 homes in the Northeast for a year, depending on energy use.

There is also the Administratively Determined Incentive or ADI, which gives solar projects a steady, guaranteed payment for the power they make and the Competitive Solicitation Incentive or CSI, where bigger projects compete for state support, with the most cost-effective proposals winning the incentives.

To fill the void left by the federal government, the state would need to expand these, said Potosnak, of the League of Conservation Voters. But he also recognized that it would be a hard sell to advocate for transferring dollars into these programs, given that the Trump administration has also cut funding for housing, healthcare and food assistance.

“So if you backfill one thing, then something else is on the chopping block,” said Potosnak.

Just in the latest budget deliberations, New Jersey diverted $190 million from its climate investment funds in response to a budget shortfall and competing demands for state spending. It is the largest climate fund diversion under the administration of Gov. Phil Murphy.

Will the state step up more for renewables? It will depend on the governor it elects in November. Competing for the seat are U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman and gubernatorial candidate. Sherrill wants to continue the incentive programs, while Ciattarelli has repeatedly condemned them as “radical.”

But before his term ends, Murphy will make a final push to enshrine into law the state’s goal of achieving fossil-fuel-free energy production by 2035, which would encourage more investment in renewables.

Three weeks after completing the solar installation training program, Kavone has yet to install a single panel.

“From what I understand, it’s tough right now,” said Kavone.

He has applied for 12 solar companies. None of them have gotten back to him. Kavone is worried that companies might be hesitant to hire him because he was formerly incarcerated.

People with incarceration histories face far higher unemployment than the general population. A 2018 report from the Prison Policy Institute showed that, on average, about a quarter of formerly incarcerated people are unemployed, a rate higher than the total U.S. unemployment rate during any period in history, including the Great Depression.

Kavone’s ice cream shop will have to wait. But he still hopes.

“I am a hundred percent still optimistic and still searching,” Kavone said. “The sun will power my future.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:01:47.184461

Thanks to hydrogen power, “they’re able to be more productive [and] run longer.","For Andy Marsh — and for Plug Power [PLUG] — the secret to success is experience. “We didn’t enter hydrogen yesterday. We’ve been doing it for 25 years.”

Headquartered in Slingerlands, New York, Plug Power develops products used to liquefy, store, transport and dispense hydrogen, including electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen.

The goal is to make hydrogen “economical, easy and everywhere”.

Marsh himself got his start as a Technical Director at Bell Labs, a premier research facility. In 2001, he co-founded Valere Power, a power solutions company for the communications industry, and served as its CEO for seven years. In 2008, he was appointed CEO of Plug Power, and has driven the company’s transformation from a hydrogen fuel cell manufacturer to a full-spectrum hydrogen solutions provider.

Navigating a Difficult Market

Even as legislators seem to be turning their back on green energy, how is Plug maintaining its momentum? To Marsh, it’s a matter of value.

“In many cases, you have to be more than just green.”

He provides the example of forklifts powered by Plug products. Thanks to hydrogen power, “they’re able to be more productive [and] run longer. They fuel faster, you need less labor, so the value proposition isn’t just sustainability.”

Consistency is another key factor. “Making things that work and run every day, that’s what Plug does. And that really differentiates us.”

While solar and wind have become prominent targets of the Trump administration, hydrogen has fared better. In June, the US Senate extended 45V hydrogen tax credit eligibility through to the end of 2027. “The recent bill passed in the United States, from a fuel cell point of view, was much more beneficial than the Inflation Reduction Act. Our fuel cells have a tax credit of over 30% through 2032.”

In January, the company closed a loan worth $1.66bn from the Department of Energy, helping to finance the construction of six zero- or low-carbon hydrogen projects in the US.

So far, Plug’s work with the Department of Energy has been positive: “it’s a business environment and it’s transactional. And we’re working to make sure the transaction’s good for the US and good for Plug.”

Attracting top talent is another important element in staying ahead of the curve in a highly competitive sector. Marsh attributes their edge to an accepting culture: “we fundamentally believe everybody adds value … it’s important to the leadership team at Plug, and to the board, that employees like coming here every day.”

Funding Net Zero

As Marsh explains, there are two key drivers for demand for hydrogen, and especially green hydrogen.

The first — sustainability targets set by countries — depends on extra measures such as subsidies to make early-deployment technologies commercially competitive.

The second — industrial processes — has created demand for hydrogen in unexpected places, such as oil refining. By installing electrolyzers, oil refineries are able to generate green hydrogen to power operations, replacing the grey hydrogen usually produced from burning natural gas, and reducing the refinery’s carbon footprint. In September 2024, for example, the company partnered with bp [BP] and Iberdrola [IBDRY] to supply 25MW of electrolyzers for their joint refinery project in Valencia, Spain.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is another driver of hydrogen demand. In October 2023, Plug provided a 280MW electrolyzer system to Danish firm Arcadia eFuels for its SAF plant, with the capacity to produce 120 tons of green hydrogen per day.

Such ongoing projects have helped Plug improve its financials.

In Q2 2025, the company reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue, driven by a three-fold increase in electrolyzer revenue. The company’s gross margin also improved from -92% the previous year to -31% in Q2 2025, due in part to reduced costs and improved hydrogen pricing.

Marsh expects the company to reach gross margin breakeven by the end of the year, and potentially to be EBITDA positive by the end of 2026. He outlines three approaches the company is deploying to get there.

First, the company has to reach “about $200m revenue in a quarter”.

Second, it has to lower costs.

Third, it has to expand its service business to maintain longer-term revenue streams.

Ultimately, the area where Marsh foresees the most benefit in cutting costs is not through high-tech, artificial intelligence-driven productivity. Rather, it comes down to something as simple as construction expenses. “If you take a look at the cost of building a hydrogen plant,” Marsh explains, “probably 60%, 65 % of it is construction costs.”

Modular design is likely to help alleviate some of this financial burden, Marsh says. “This is no different than how people may be thinking about how you build homes in the future. We have to design our products so that they can just be dropped in place. There’s very, very little construction next to interconnects happening.”

The benefits of such a system are manifold. “It accelerates the time to market. It makes costs dramatically lower. It makes it possible that hydrogen can compete with other energy sources immediately.”",https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/Andy_Marsh_plug_power_medium.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:02:02.136729

In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.
According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.
“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said.
This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.","Iowa utilities still have a “long way to go” to meet a 2035 net zero emissions goal, especially as changes at the federal level have accelerated the timelines for key wind and solar tax credits, according to the 2025 Iowa Electric Generation Condition of the State report.

The annual report from Iowa Environmental Council said in order to meet this net zero goal, utilities not only have to transition away from coal but also continue to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 30%-60% over the next 20 years.

The net zero goal is consistent with federal goals from 2021 that directed the energy sector to achieve net zero emissions, or emissions that are equal to the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere, by 2035.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change similarly found in 2022 that global greenhouse gas emissions must reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change, including limiting global temperature increases.

Steve Guyer, IEC’s energy policy counsel, said in a webinar Wednesday about the report that climate change costs Iowa businesses, families, governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year.

“I want us to keep in mind that energy, the environment and the economy are actually inextricably linked,” Guyer said.

Guyer, and the report, said coal generation which has the greatest greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, not only “drives climate change” but also has negative effects on public health, creates air pollution, can cause premature death and can even impact corn yields.

“Air pollution does not discriminate,” Guyer said. “Everybody has to suffer, and is burdened by, basically, this impact – not only financially, but otherwise.”

Coal down, wind and solar up

In Iowa, the share of coal-based electric generation has declined consistently since 2010, according to the report. From 2021 to 2024, fossil fuel generation decreased by 9% in the state.

The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019. In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.

Solar increased in 2024 to represent 1% of the share of electricity generation. According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.

“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said. “That places us certainly ahead of any other state as far as the percent of generation from renewables. It also means that we are uniquely positioned to actually achieve 100% carbon free by 2035.”

Geoff Greenwood, the media relations manager for one of Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa’s status as a leader in clean energy is “in large part because of MidAmerican Energy’s clean energy leadership.”

Wind makes up the majority, or 64%, of MidAmerica’s energy mix. Greenwood said in an email that since 2004, the company has invested in more than 7,600 megawatts of wind and 141 MW of solar, and has plans to invest in hundreds more by 2028. According to the company’s website, it delivered “the equivalent of 100% carbon-free energy” to Iowa customers in 2024.

“The environmental benefits of renewable generation are not diminished by the timing of its production—each and every megawatt of clean energy MidAmerican generates contributes to overall emissions reductions and supports our customers’ sustainability goals and Iowa’s leadership in clean energy,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican has made, and continues to make, significant, measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading Iowa’s electric sector in decarbonization efforts.”

The report points out that despite the significant share of wind and solar generation in the state and commitments from MidAmerican and Alliant Energy, to achieve net zero emissions, Iowa has six operational fossil-fuel power plants.

According to the report these plants emitted more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024, along with several thousand tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

Power plants represent about 16% of Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The report shows that agriculture at 29% accounts for the largest share of emissions in the state, closely followed by residential, commercial and industrial fossil fuel use.

Greenwood said MidAmerican has already retired “several coal units” and “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” He noted the existing plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations.

Coal generation in Iowa is nearly 52% lower in 2024 than it was in 2005, and carbon emissions have decreased by 47% in the same time, according to Greenwood.

“The Council’s report itself acknowledges that the electric sector is the only sector in Iowa that has made meaningful progress in reducing GHG emissions,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican is proud to be a key contributor to that progress.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said in an email the company is implementing a strategic plan to “create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities.”

Alliant plans to, by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utility operations to 50% of 2005 levels, and to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040.

According to the spokesperson, the company reduced its 2005 emission levels by 39% in 2024.

“We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our goals remain the same, however, increasing customer energy needs, reliability and resource adequacy requirements and tax policy changes may result in delays in achieving, or revisions to, our goals.”

‘Staggering’ increases in energy needs projected

Guyer said energy demand is increasing rapidly, in part due to the implementation of data centers.

According to the report, which analyzed modeling projections from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO power pool, Iowa has a projected load growth of between 30% and 60% over the next 20 years.

Guyer said that projected load, plus a change in MISO’s rules as to what can count towards a utility’s accredited capacity, means there is a “staggering” amount of energy that will be required in the next 20 years.

“We have a, I’ll just say, a staggering mission ahead of us,” Guyer said. “Not only do we have to try and achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but we have to try and do that while we’re also trying to meet this increase in demand.”

Greenwood said the “exponentially” growing demand for energy noted in the report, means that “a dependable supply during this growth is critical.”

“Our long-term vision remains clear: we are striving to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the reliability our customers expect,” Greenwood said. “It’s crucial that our energy transition balances reliability and affordability with environmental responsibility. Reliable electricity is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”

Timeline for tax credits changed

Guyer said utilities need to “aggressively move” to make use of the wind and solar credits made available under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.

The massive, Republican-led tax incentive and spending bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” which was signed into law in July, shrinks the timeline for these credits.

Now, to be eligible for the credits, projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be placed in service before 2028, according to the report.

“Even though there was an urgency back with the IRA, that has been exponentially increased now due to the big, beautiful bill,” Guyer said.

But, Guyer said, whether a company can make use of IRA credits or not, renewable energy projects are still the cheapest forms of electric generation in Iowa.

“Even without the credit, the renewable generation will still be lower cost, but the credit certainly will have an impact and help customers overall,” Guyer said.

About 40 projects slated to go online after tax credits are set to expire have been withdrawn.
""There were some projects that were sort of marginal, that the economic viability of the project depended on the tax credits,"" Chambers said.
Under Trump's bill, solar and wind projects must start construction before July 4, 2026, or be placed in service before Dec. 31, 2027, to receive tax credits.
""Less solar power, less wind power will be added to the U.S. grid in the next few years than would have otherwise.","Proposed utility-scale solar projects were expected to generate 19 gigawatts of electricity for a power-hungry Louisiana.

But President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill and the 2027 sunsetting of tax credits for the industry have created an exodus and slashed that total to nine gigawatts, says Terrance Chambers, director of the Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

About 40 projects slated to go online after tax credits are set to expire have been withdrawn. No reason has been given for the withdrawal.

""There were some projects that were sort of marginal, that the economic viability of the project depended on the tax credits,"" Chambers said. ""What I anticipate has happened was that those projects are the ones that were withdrawn.""

One gigawatt of electricity generated by solar panels can roughly power 100,000 homes in the state. If all 19 gigawatts were built, around 1.9 million homes could be powered by the renewable technology, according to estimates by the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Under Trump's bill, solar and wind projects must start construction before July 4, 2026, or be placed in service before Dec. 31, 2027, to receive tax credits. Previously, the industry had until the 2030s to begin construction under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, projects received a 30% tax credit for the buildout of zero-emission plants. Those credits played a significant role in the country's growth of solar and wind energy.

In other states, projects and government leaders are looking at ways to fast-track their current projects ahead of the deadline or face increased costs.

Louisiana has about 40 active projects, according to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's Generator Interconnection Queue map. Most of them are in early stages of study, Chambers said.

The projected nine gigawatts is a hopeful number, said Chambers, who expects around five to seven, with losses likely resulting from pushback from residents in project areas and agricultural interests.

Despite the Trump administration labeling the technology unreliable and expensive, solar remains a cheap and quickly deployable energy source, Chambers said. He believes solar will continue to be viable without subsidies.

""Policy, of course, has an impact, and we saw the impact,"" he said. ""But I think the economics are there, and so now it's going to continue to happen.""

Louisiana is expected to add more than 4,000 megawatts of solar energy capacity over the next five years, according to SEIA projections.

Meta's Louisiana AI data center alone requires at least 2,600 megawatts. The company has agreed to build 1,500 megawatts of solar power for the state, with additional energy for the facility coming from three gas-fired plants.

In 2023, Louisiana's solar industry contributed over $440 million to the state's economy, generated approximately $10 million in local tax revenue and supported 5,100 jobs. The state has received a total of $2.3 billion in solar investment, according to SEIA.

The state risks losing out on the economic impact of solar projects, to the tune of billions of dollars worth of lost capital investment, Chambers said.

Residents in the affected parishes, however, have raised objections, pushing proposed projects back while governments considered rules, regulations and possible bans on solar farms.

Their concerns focus on land use of the massive solar projects, impacts to property values, the degradation of rural life and agricultural land and the question of what happens to these projects once they run their lifecycle.

In August, NextEra Energy withdrew its plans to build a 2,000-acre solar farm in Iberville Parish. The project would have added 175 megawatts to the grid but faced an uphill battle when it encountered local opposition.

Beyond Louisiana, Chambers said, Trump's moves could pose a threat to American energy dominance during a time of rapidly growing energy needs and significant backlogs on traditional energy components such as turbines, with wait projections up to seven years.

Nationally, the Trump administration's moves could kill 81 gigawatts of new power capacity by 2033, according to renewable energy investment firm Segue Sustainable Infrastructure.

""We're going to see less power put on the system,"" said Sean Gallagher, SEIA's senior vice president of policy. ""Less solar power, less wind power will be added to the U.S. grid in the next few years than would have otherwise. And this is at a time of rising electricity demand.""

Solar, he added, will be a large player in the American energy market again due to its scalability and ability to be deployed quickly. It seems the market agrees, because 96% of new energy capacity in the country was generated by solar, batteries and wind in 2024.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/85/d85f09c4-181b-518a-92fc-04c175ed57bf/6492229c861a0.image.jpg?crop=1743%2C915%2C0%2C136&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-11 12:02:07.606595

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
“However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said.","Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said.

Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.

The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.

Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.

While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.

“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”

According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.

In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.

Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.

Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.

The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.

In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.

But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.

Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.

“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”

In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.

While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.

“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.

Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.

In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.

One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.

“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”

In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.

Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.

However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.

“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Johns Hopkins research backs up estimate

Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.

Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)

“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”

Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.

Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.

Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.

Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.

A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.

Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.

“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.

At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.

State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.

Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.

“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”

Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.

While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.

“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”

Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.

“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-107-2000x1333-1.webp,N,,2025-09-11 14:01:22.074324

Eco Wave Power is one of those exciting technologies that is ready to scale. It has solved many of the problems that other technologies have come up against, for harnessing something as challenging as wave energy.”

Michael J. Galvin, Director of Waterfront and Commercial Real Estate at the Port of Los Angeles, noted: “The San Pedro Bay Port Complex has big goals to get to zero emissions in the next decade. We can only do this with significantly scaled-up local energy generation. Projects like this are super important to get us there. We can’t do it without localised energy sources, and this project provides us the ability to get there – to make this port the cleanest it can be. That’s a critical component of the port’s goals over the next decade. Eco Wave Power’s adaptive reuse of a very old port structure that is not used for anything else and now will be used to demonstrate how energy can be generated out of the ocean. We are really happy to be using the power of the ocean to continue the efforts here and bring the technologies and solutions that we need at the Port of Los Angeles to get to zero emissions in our port complex.”

Eco Wave Power is actively expanding its global footprint, with upcoming projects planned in the Port of Los Angeles, Portugal, Taiwan, and India-contributing to a growing project pipeline of 404.7 MW.

“We are concerned that the cancellation process undertaken by the department was haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven, and we are disturbed that the department intends to continue to use this same fatally flawed and politicized process to terminate more awards in the near future,” wrote U.S. Sen.

“This is highly unusual and counter to long-standing DOE precedent,” they wrote. “It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the department followed in selecting each of the awards.”

The lawmakers also noted that DOE’s cancellation of the projects warrants further investigation, and requested that Wright answer several questions by Sept. 23 detailing the process the department used to cancel the loans that OCED designated; if DOE intends to cancel more awarded projects that previously went through a rigorous, merit-based approval processes; and if so, if DOE will use the same cancellation process run by political appointees used to cancel OCED projects on May 30, among others.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/shutterstock_2201411241.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:01:50.996637

However, it seems the news is not sparking much interest among investors, as the automaker’s shares dropped nearly 1% in early trading on Thursday morning, adding to the almost 2% decline from the day before.

The Kentucky site has been a key part of Toyota’s North American operations for almost four decades, producing, as part of its lineup, the Camry, one of the manufacturer’s most famous passenger cars in the United States.

Is Toyota Re-strategizing amid Trump Tariffs?

The latest development comes as Toyota appears to be making arrangements to boost its hybrid vehicle production in the U.S., while moving the luxury segment of its lineup to Japan. According to Nikkei Asia, Toyota is considering merging its two Lexus plants in the U.S. into one.

The Japanese automaker currently produces the Lexus ES sedans in Kentucky, while the Lexus TX SUV is assembled in Indiana. However, reports indicate the manufacturer might stop production of the ES once current orders are completed, with the next model to be exported from Japan.

Rivals Take the Other Road

On the other hand, other Asian automakers appear to be taking a different road, even as President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported vehicles, including from Japan, force automakers to reconsider their manufacturing strategies.

Earlier in the year, Hyundai (HYMLF) disclosed plans to invest $21 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. Tokyo-based Hitachi (HTHIY) also recently launched a $100 million factory in Maryland to produce train cars.

Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In Oct. 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “one big, beautiful bill,” passed on July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it could find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Solar panels, electric vehicles affected by policy changes

Sara Ross, cofounder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50% off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phase-out timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as electric vehicle charging stations at schools. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing, and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects are becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

Projects will need to start work soon to qualify

New Treasury Department guidance, issued Aug. 15, made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5% of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects are in a position where they’re not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

Student activists look for new paths toward climate goals

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of Zero Net Energy by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.

Consultants and sustainability coordinators said that they don’t see the demand for renewable energy going away. “Solar is the cheapest form of energy. It makes sense to put it on every rooftop that we can. And that’s true with or without tax credits,” Strehlow said.

WASHINGTON — Last month, Melvin White's first cohort of future solar technicians was ready to begin training.

White's Port Arthur-based company was among the participants in Texas' Solar for All program, a federally funded initiative to deploy solar energy in homes across Texas and build out a workforce to install the technology in low- and moderate-income communities. The Environmental Protection Agency awarded nearly $250 million last year to a coalition of local governments and nonprofits, led by Harris County, to fund Texas' share of the Biden-era clean energy program.

White's company, a workforce development organization which helps train and place skilled laborers, selected 25 people to teach on solar installation and ultimately be placed in an apprenticeship. He had purchased some necessary lab equipment and was set to begin training when, on Aug. 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that he was ending all existing Solar for All contracts in order to recoup the federal government's investment and cut what the Trump administration sees as wasteful spending.

""The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin wrote on X. ""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!""

White and others were left scrambling.

Workforce development organizations that had already begun training are trying to rebuild trust in their communities after having to cancel programs. Groups that were providing technical assistance are trying to recoup their losses. And everyone agrees that while coalition members can try to find private funding to preserve some components of Solar for All, there's no replacing the $250 million or the direct assistance to low-income households.

""We’re trying now to redirect and seeing how we can salvage the people that we’ve recruited to be in this program — cost-wise for operations, as well as [with] our credibility in the community,"" White said. ""[We told] people we have a program we’re going to start, and all of a sudden we’re not able to start it.""

The funding was already doled out by the Biden administration, leading many Democrats and coalition members to say the move is illegal. Eight Texas Democrats in Congress, led by Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, sent a letter to Zeldin calling for the funds to be reinstated.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, whose office was the lead applicant on the Solar for All grant, said he is exploring legal avenues to restore the grant money, but that he wants to be thoughtful in his approach and cognizant of the differing political realities faced by other members of the coalition.

""One of the challenges here is to what extent are folks willing to publicly be in opposition to President Trump,"" he said. ""I certainly am willing to do so, but not all of our partners are in the same position that I am. So we're just trying to get everybody in line, get all of our ducks in a row, and to really do a deep dive of the issues to make sure that if we bring a lawsuit, that we’re best positioned for success.""

The broader Solar for All coalition, which had planned to operate in 10 municipalities around the state, has been left reeling from the cancellation of a program created specifically to reduce household energy bills. Left in limbo are programs to provide rooftop solar on low-income single-family homes in Waco, bring community solar to Brownsville, install battery storage in Houston to serve neighborhoods during power outages and train solar technicians in Dallas.

Without the support of the federal government and with no money coming from the state to replace it, the coalition's effort to deliver solar energy to low-income households and build greater grid resiliency will have to shrink considerably.

""We’re not going to give up by any means,"" said Sam Silerio, the Texas Program Director at Solar United Neighbors, which was working on grant implementation, and a solar contractor himself in El Paso. ""But as we look to pivot, it’s not the same...the scale and the scope of Solar for All was massive, and unlike anything we’d ever seen before. Losing it is a huge loss.""

What is Solar for All?

Created by congressional Democrats and signed into law by then-President Joe Biden in 2022, the Solar for All program was intended to lower energy bills and create jobs through new residential solar and battery storage installations.

Menefee, a Democrat who is running for Congress in the open 18th District, said Solar for All was among the largest clean energy partnerships in the history of the state and would have addressed three key issues — high costs, job growth and resiliency.

""This is exactly what you want to see in a program,"" he said. ""It’s going to help people with affordability. It’s going to increase the number of jobs. It’s going to strengthen our grid when we know that ERCOT has had issues over the last few years. And it’s a coalition of folks across the political spectrum who are working together to bring it in.""

Low-income households — with eligibility determined by geographic area — could qualify for financial assistance from the program to install solar panels and batteries in their home or conduct home energy efficiency upgrades. As a condition of the program, the installation of solar energy would need to save households, for rooftop solar, or communities, for community solar, at least 20% on their monthly energy bills.

Coalition leaders said Solar for All was going to benefit 28,000 households across the state, with an average annual savings of $468.

Some municipalities had already selected households; others were in the process of doing so or had settled on a number of households they planned to service.

Margo Weisz, the executive director of the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, said that one-third of low-income households in Texas either turn off their air conditioning or keep it at uncomfortable levels because their energy bills are prohibitively expensive, according to her organization's annual survey.

Her institute was managing Solar for All community and rooftop solar programs in Brownsville, Laredo and El Paso — all border communities where their survey found that energy costs are most prohibitive.

""We’re really looking at a huge energy affordability problem for people,"" Weisz said. ""With Solar for All, the intent was really to try to address the affordability needs of Americans who struggle most.""

Beyond direct installations and cost savings, Solar for All had a workforce development component that companies like White's were taking part in. While household installations had not yet begun, training Texans on solar technology had. In Houston, Port Arthur and Waco, programs to certify Texans in solar installation and as solar ambassadors — who could help explain the installation process to participating households — were already underway.

The Houston Area Urban League, for example, had received a grant to put on solar technology training classes and offer job placement services for the next five years. That group had already completed a three-week course for 18 people, and had selected 15 people for the second cohort when its funding was pulled.

And with the need for energy resiliency demonstrated by recent hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and 2021 Winter Storm Uri, Solar for All also provided funds for resilience hubs — community centers or homes outfitted with solar and battery technology at no cost to the participant to serve as a gathering place in the event of power outages.

The coalition had begun by selecting 30 homes and a resilience center site in Harris County to serve as those hubs. Because the resilience hubs rely on battery storage — an expensive technology — the coalition's capacity to try to move forward with that element of the project is particularly endangered.

Because Solar for All-funded infrastructure projects had to adhere to regulations requiring materials to be domestically sourced, coalition members also believed that the program could have economic impacts beyond its operational life.

""Eventually, we would have spurred a Texas economy for manufacturing these solar parts, and the jobs associated with that and the ones [created] to install solar,"" said Margaret Cook, the vice president of water and community resilience at coalition member Houston Advanced Research Center. ""We were expecting to have a good amount of impact on jobs in Texas with this program, and then also [provide] contracting opportunities for local businesses.""

Workforce development groups and solar contractors believe solar energy is still an attractive proposition in Texas and that their work will continue, albeit at a smaller scale. But for the local governments expecting millions in investment, the future is murky.

""It's like being uninvited to the dance you're looking for,"" said Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia, a solar energy proponent who represents east Houston. ""You go buy a new suit, get your haircut, shine your shoes, and then you've got no dance to go to.""

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. reached a new high in August, with buyers accelerating purchases to utilize a federal tax credit before its expiration, as reported by Yahoo Finance. A total of 146,000 EVs were sold, capturing a record 9.9% market share, according to data from Cox Automotive.

The sales surge was precipitated by the decision from President of the United States Donald Trump's administration to terminate the $7,500 incentive for new American-made electric vehicles on September 30. This policy shift fueled significant sales increases for manufacturers like Ford, General Motors, and Hyundai. However, Tesla Inc. was an outlier, experiencing a 6.7% decline in U.S. sales year-over-year for August. Data from the IndexBox platform corroborates the overall market growth while highlighting Tesla's contrasting performance. The company's share of the EV market fell to 38%, its lowest point in eight years, despite its average vehicle prices being approximately 5.5% lower than the previous year.

Analysts point to several challenges for Tesla, including public reaction to CEO Elon Musk's political statements, which have led to incidents of vandalism and protest against the company's vehicles. Furthermore, Tesla has not introduced a new mass-market model in several years, during which time competition has intensified from rivals such as Chevrolet, Ford, and Hyundai. This trend is reflected in Tesla's global sales, which were down nearly 14% year-over-year in the second quarter, following a similar decline in the first quarter.

Ely, Ari Simon, Aaron Seybert, Abigail Dillen",,,,,https://ssir.org/articles/entry/earthjustice-oil-and-gas-fight,"Deferring the necessary energy transition in the United States will only increase its cost while foregoing the immediate economic benefits of new clean energy investment and jobs.
Similarly, during the first Trump administration, over 300 new petrochemical plants were proposed, predominantly in the Gulf South and Appalachia.
Swift energy transition depends on scaling up affordable clean energy.
Because strong laws and regulations give rise to effective litigation strategies, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate them.
Clean energy transition can be an engine for new jobs and healthier communities.","The Trump administration is advancing an extreme, genuinely catastrophic energy policy that requires the strongest possible counter-offensive from climate advocates and funders. As our climate deadlines bear down on us, it is past time to come together around a broadly aligned and robustly resourced strategy, both to promote rapid clean energy deployment and limit the massive oil and gas expansion now underway. Crucially, the organizing and place-based work that is needed to stop irreversible fossil fuel entrenchment is also work that is needed to create the political conditions for ambitious climate action within a functioning democracy.

In these last-chance years to shift our climate trajectory from catastrophic to livable, the United States is producing more crude oil than any country ever has. In 2024, the United States was also the world’s biggest gas producer. The ascendancy of oil and gas interests is a defining fact of American life—economically, politically, and culturally. This was true during the Biden administration, which presided over an oil and gas boom notwithstanding historic climate ambition and accomplishments. It is unmistakably true now, as the second Trump administration pursues a crystal clear agenda to crush clean energy and enshrine oil and gas dependence.

The scale and urgency of the current threat should settle a long-simmering debate about the strategic value of targeting oil and gas production directly. There is no inherent tension between efforts to limit fossil fuel production and efforts to boost clean alternatives, and many advocates understand them both to be necessary and intertwined. But there is also a competing and philanthropically consequential view that the only effective way to overcome the outsize power of the fossil fuels industry is to invest in solutions-side advocacy. Given the scale of new oil and gas development that is slated for lock-in domestically and also globally, it is not enough to focus on limiting demand for fossil fuels. The imperatives over the next three years are to block further oil and gas expansion, drive clean energy progress, protect our bedrock environmental laws, and to use every fight to build a stronger, more activated base of support for energy transition.

Limiting Oil and Gas Expansion

The climate imperative to stop oil and gas expansion is clear. As the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) has consistently affirmed, greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure are already on track to drive temperature rise greater than 1.5 degrees Celsius. New oil and gas development is taking us further off the narrow pathway to climate stability, perhaps irretrievably.

Ceding the clean energy economy and redoubling investment in oil and gas is the wrong path forward, especially given that current oil and gas production is more than sufficient to meet near term needs both domestically and geopolitically. Deferring the necessary energy transition in the United States will only increase its cost while foregoing the immediate economic benefits of new clean energy investment and jobs. The same logic applies globally. US export strategy—and especially tariff negotiations that lock in uptake of US oil and gas—will make energy transition slower and more expensive for other countries too.

Nevertheless, the United States is on a building spree as well as a tariff offensive. This year and next, oil and gas production is expected to begin at 13 new “fields” in the Gulf of Mexico. As of July 2025, there were seven new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals under construction, 11 more terminals approved, and four terminals either proposed or in the pre-filing stage of the permitting process. As of June 2025, 18.7 gigawatts of new gas capacity were slated to come online by 2028, with 4.3 GW already under construction.

Beyond the climate implications, these big new projects are increasing toxic health burdens on people who have to live near them, especially in the Gulf South and Appalachia, which are targeted for the most deadly pollution and the least economic benefit. Existing rates of premature death, cancer, asthma, and other disease in oil and gas hubs should be compelling a swift transition to cleaner alternatives. Instead, the Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to eliminate pollution control requirements and other health protections so that it can further accelerate oil and gas development.

Similarly, the Trump Interior Department is advancing an extreme iteration of “drill-baby-drill” policy to open up public lands and coastal waters to drilling and fast-track new infrastructure projects under the pretext of a false “energy emergency.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) turbo-charged these efforts with the most sweeping public lands giveaway in modern history. Among other things, it mandates 30 offshore lease sales of 80 million acres each in the Gulf of Mexico and quarterly oil and gas lease sales for onshore public lands across more than 200 million acres in the West.

In short, the Trump administration is poised to lock in oil and gas dependence—generationally. And its attacks on environmental laws and regulations and the agencies charged with environmental protection are, to a remarkable degree, designed to advance fossil interests. But it is possible to stop harmful projects and redirect national trends, even when it requires facing off against powerful corporations backed by the White House. For example, under the first George W. Bush administration, Vice President Cheney convened an energy task force that proposed construction of 200 new coal plants to address a purported energy emergency. That was a prescription for runaway climate change, but advocates successfully harnessed organizing and litigation to block 170 of those plants. Similarly, during the first Trump administration, over 300 new petrochemical plants were proposed, predominantly in the Gulf South and Appalachia. Concerted local opposition, supported by organizing, lawsuits, and sharp communications strategies have so far succeeded in blocking much of that build-out.

Fundamental goods such as clean air and water do not simply exist. They are the product of ongoing and vigilant enforcement of strong legal standards and requirements.

New fossil fuels development on the scale contemplated by the Trump administration will harm and antagonize millions of people—including people who are already living with unconscionable cancer risks from fossil fuels pollution, people who are weathering devastating climate shocks, people who treasure our public lands, people who are ready to fight to keep their air and water clean. To harness that opposition and derail a coming onslaught of lawless federal actions, philanthropy needs to support (1) organizations that have community standing and influence to lead local opposition; (2) organizations that can provide excellent support, including applied scientific and economic analysis and legal representation; and (3) coalition and campaigning infrastructure that accelerates learning across communities and aggregates their collective power for political impact. Leaders across the country are already doing this work, but their capacity is constantly overstretched. Without more support, it will be overwhelmed.

Driving Faster Deployment of Clean Energy

Of course, it will not be sufficient to stop new oil and gas projects. Swift energy transition depends on scaling up affordable clean energy. With the loss of IRA incentives and escalating attacks on wind and solar energy, it will take a much bigger push to deploy clean energy fast enough.

In the OBBBA, Congress abandoned any pretense of resource-neutral energy policy and picked winners (oil and gas) and losers (wind and solar), eliminating or rapidly phasing out nearly all federal investments that were instrumental in scaling wind and solar even before the Biden administration. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is waging an all-out offensive on renewables, holding up permits, blocking new wind developments, and directing the Justice Department to attack state climate initiatives, including the essential policies that advanced clean energy deployment during the first Trump administration.

This extraordinary hostility to clean energy demands a commensurate counter-offensive. Energy advocates and litigators need more support to handle a new volume of work with defining implications for energy regulation. As the Trump administration tries to brand clean energy as anti-American, more investment in organizing and communications work is required, especially in local venues, including city councils, zoning boards, and public utility commissions, where fossil fuel interests are successfully rallying local opposition based on disinformation—for example, that wind turbines and solar arrays cause cancer.

Crucially, the climate community must supercharge advocacy and litigation to avoid unnecessary investment in new gas capacity to meet growing energy demand. In theory, it is possible to abandon expensive new assets, but in real life it rarely happens. No matter what, building new billion-dollar gas-fired power plants will lock in higher electricity rates for decades to come, making it more economically painful and less politically saleable to modernize the grid.

As the current rush to build new gas plants illustrates, the work to advance clean energy must be integrated with work to limit oil and gas expansion. And, to achieve durable and transformative outcomes, a holistic energy strategy should be grounded in popular and practical plans for energy transition regionally and locally. Clean energy technologies are mature enough to make the next leaps in scale, and there are proven policies to catalyze their uptake. What we need now are better roadmaps for accomplishing the transition in keeping with logistical, social and economic imperatives and constraints that vary across the country. In states with fragile and failing economies that are fossil fuel dependent—West Virginia, Louisiana, Alaska for example—what is the practical path toward a new economy that increases health and wealth? In states like Texas and North Dakota with booming oil and gas plays, what is the economic engine to ensure that energy transition will not leave people worse off? In a state like California that has invested heavily in clean energy, what is the best way to ensure access to affordable energy during the messy period when refineries are going off-line but people are still driving gas-fueled cars? Philanthropy can play a catalytic role in eliciting and enabling serious planning that grapples effectively with problems that will stall energy transition unless and until there are real, politically compelling solutions in sight.

Protecting Bedrock Environmental Laws and Regulations

In all the work ahead, litigation can and must play a role in stopping fossil fuels expansion and enabling timely energy transition. The sheer lawlessness of the Trump administration’s approach will give rise to cases that can prevail even in hostile courts and a legal landscape that has been disrupted by the Supreme Court. Win or lose, when lawsuits are premised on serious wrongs that our justice system should make right, they are powerful vehicles for raising the profile of issues and leaders, organizing effective opposition, and holding the government and powerful corporate actors publicly accountable. This is true of many kinds of cases including enforcement actions, challenges to government rulemaking and project permitting, and lawsuits to hold oil and gas companies financially liable—for example, the growing number of cases that municipalities are bringing against oil and gas companies for the damages caused by climate deception.

Because strong laws and regulations give rise to effective litigation strategies, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate them. Its target list includes regulations that address air and water pollution, waste disposal, chemical safety, ecosystem and species protection, and public lands stewardship. Republicans in Congress are pushing the same deregulatory agenda, while also trying to close the courthouse doors to public interest lawsuits. For example, the House and Senate energy committees are pushing for “pay to play” permitting provisions that would give developers the ability to pay for fast permits that would be immune from court challenges. To attract Democrats, they are framing efforts to gut statutes and preclude judicial review as “permitting reform”—a hot and divisive topic in the climate space.

There is certainly room to improve regulatory systems in the United States. We need to adequately staff and budget for faster environmental review. We should be scoping permitting processes to address the most salient issues of concern, not compiling hundreds of pages of analysis on immaterial issues. We can and should create pathways to streamline approvals for clean energy projects that confer essential environmental benefits. But the notion that we can do without environmental regulation is wrong. Fundamental goods such as clean air and water do not simply exist. They are the product of ongoing and vigilant enforcement of strong legal standards and requirements. Especially under the Trump administration, it would be disastrous to trade away bedrock environmental laws in hopes that deregulation will help us build clean energy infrastructure faster.

Deregulation will only benefit oil and gas incumbents that have no problem building things in the United States. Especially after passage of the OBBBA, clean energy is competing on a playing field that is tilted even further toward fossil fuels. In this political context, weakening environmental laws would not overcome the entrenched advantages enjoyed by the oil and gas industry. It would affirmatively advance the Trump administration’s fossil-first agenda and erode the competitive advantages that clean energy commands. To speed up clean energy deployment, we need tailored policies that are expressly designed to achieve that result. Gutting the laws that safeguard everyone’s right to a clean and healthy environment is not a pragmatic, second best solution.

Getting Organized

Demonizing regulation and climate advocacy is part of the Trump fossil-first agenda, and to a shocking extent, it is working. Nationally, Democrats are going quiet on climate change while climate disasters rock the country. Even in California, one of the world’s greatest laboratories for climate policy and action, there is a retrenchment in climate leadership.

It is not surprising to see climate resolve faltering as inconvenient deadlines for energy transition loom. No matter who is running the country, it will take enormous political will and logistical brilliance to transition the US economy away from oil and gas. The overwhelmingly powerful climate movement that could summon such political will is not yet here. But it could be. There are smart and talented leaders all around the country. Extreme weather is now personal for most people, whether they call it climate change or not. Clean energy transition can be an engine for new jobs and healthier communities. The conditions are ripe for organizing, but serious investment is required.

Now is the time to support communities to grapple in earnest with what it will really take, region by region, state by state, town by town, to manage a transition that leaves no one behind. Over the coming years, there will be many necessary fights to stop harmful oil and gas projects. Each one will present an opportunity to activate people around a practical vision for what we want instead. To maximize those opportunities, we need shared plans for the future and the relationships and resources to act on them together. As our current political moment makes clear, it is a daunting project to shift the common sense of a country that has centered the oil and gas industry for over 150 years—in our infrastructure, policy, and culture. But it is the project, and it will not get done without a very big fight.

“The logical trigger was the tax credit,” he told Latitude Media.
Of course, it’s still a complicated time for the U.S. solar manufacturing industry, which is still adjusting to the new tariffs and sourcing rules introduced by the Trump administration.
But for Tigo — and for certain peers like solar tracker company Nextracker, which announced its acquisition of Origami Solar this week — there is still sufficient incentive to onshore.
“Offshoring manufacturing is cheaper; there’s a reason why the entire world manufactures in Asia,” Dillon said.","Tigo Energy, which produces hardware and software solutions for solar systems across the world, last week announced a manufacturing partnership with the U.S.-based solar manufacturer and retailer EG4 Electronics.

As part of the new agreement, Tigo, which is headquartered in Silicon Valley, will set up production of optimizers and EG4 inverters in the U.S., and EG4 will bundle them and sell them to customers. The move adds to Tigo’s domestic manufacturing capacity, which has so far been focused mostly in Asia; EG4’s parent company Energy Access Innovations has recently opened a large manufacturing facility in Texas.

According to James Dillon, Tigo’s chief marketing officer, the decision to bring some of the company’s manufacturing capabilities to the U.S. was made with the purpose of taking advantage of the 45X tax credit for clean manufacturing. “The logical trigger was the tax credit,” he told Latitude Media.

The credit, introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, can be used by domestic manufacturers of clean energy equipment to reduce their federal tax bill. To the relief of the industry, it was left largely intact by the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which dialed back many clean energy tax incentives.

Of course, it’s still a complicated time for the U.S. solar manufacturing industry, which is still adjusting to the new tariffs and sourcing rules introduced by the Trump administration. But for Tigo — and for certain peers like solar tracker company Nextracker, which announced its acquisition of Origami Solar this week — there is still sufficient incentive to onshore.

For the optimized inverters Tigo will produce with EG4, the 45X tax credit is expected to amount to 11 cents per watt, which Dillon said should be enough to offset the increased cost of manufacturing in the U.S. versus in Asia.

“Offshoring manufacturing is cheaper; there’s a reason why the entire world manufactures in Asia,” Dillon said. “And we haven’t [started production] yet, so we don’t have the specifics. But the goal is to have the tax credit offset the increase in costs.”

Tigo’s new domestic production will target its U.S. customers, who currently constitute about 22% of its customer base. U.S. customers are increasingly interested in building projects with domestic products that can help them comply with increasingly complicated sourcing requirements, such as “foreign entity of concern” regulations. The U.S. production will not substitute Tigo’s offshore manufacturing, however; for the rest of its global customers, which are spread over more than 100 countries, Tigo will continue producing optimizers in China and Thailand.

Despite the timing of the announcement, which came just a few months after President Trump signed the OBBB into law in early July, Dillon says Tigo’s decision was not influenced by recent policy changes.

“Who knows what [President Trump] is going to do?” he asked rhetorically, adding that, while the decision to bring some manufacturing to the U.S. was indeed triggered by the existence of the 45X tax credit created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Tigo wouldn’t have followed through if it didn’t think it had long-term benefits.

“Manufacturing in the U.S. is a good thing regardless,” he said, citing benefits like a simplified supply chain and reduced shipping costs, as well as supporting more U.S. jobs.

In fact, Dillon thinks recent policy changes — despite the preservation of 45X — are bound to send the U.S. solar industry into a “solar coaster” of “chaotic up and chaotic down,” and that Tigo’s global diversification will help it weather the storm easily.

“The beauty of being worldwide is that we saw a little bit of a drop in Asia last quarter, but two quarters before that, Asia was our strongest quarter,” he said. “Like any investment, spreading your risk is a wise thing.”

More broadly, Dillon thinks onshoring manufacturing could allow the solar industry to work on the quality of its product. Dillon, who worked in the semiconductor industry for 15 years before moving to storage and solar, says that the failure rate for semiconductors is generally so low it’s measured in parts per billion. Solar panels, on the other hand, have an average failure rate of 0.05% annually, which “is orders of magnitude off.”

“The entire industry, start to finish, needs to work on qualities, from the manufacturer to the designer to the salesperson,” he said, noting that onshoring manufacturing could help it do just that. “It’s not the fact that it’d be in the U.S., but the fact that we are going to be able to start something from scratch, take the learning from every prior generation, and build it in.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-10T152308.162.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-11 13:02:09.355806

Ben Burggraaf, CEO of Net Zero Industry Wales, said: “At its core, this map sends a powerful message: Wales is not simply a collection of individual projects.
These are essential to ensuring clean power can flow efficiently into, out of, and across Wales — unlocking further investment and economic growth.","Net Zero Industry Wales (NZIW) and RenewableUK Cymru have unveiled a landmark ‘Wales Clean Growth Map’ — highlighting a £9 billion investment opportunity for Wales’ renewable energy projects and low-carbon industries.

The map is designed to help legislators, policymakers, and investors visualise the full-scale and strategic alignment of Wales’ clean energy pipeline and industrial transition, and to spotlight the transformational potential for jobs, infrastructure, and regional economies.

It not only identifies £6.9 billion which could be added to the Welsh economy over the next decade but also highlights £2.1 billion which could be saved by avoiding further deindustrialisation through investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure.

To support political understanding and constituency-level impact, the map overlays the 16 new ‘super constituencies’ which will be contested in the 2026 Senedd election. This allows political candidates and decision-makers to identify priority clean energy and industrial projects within their prospective constituencies — and to understand the local benefits they could deliver.

Ben Burggraaf, CEO of Net Zero Industry Wales, said: “At its core, this map sends a powerful message: Wales is not simply a collection of individual projects. As a nation, we are building a strong, diverse and nationally significant clean energy and low-carbon industry investment portfolio, enabling Wales to become a leading clean energy transition hub and remain a cornerstone of the UK industrial base.”

Jess Hooper, Director of RenewableUK Cymru, said: “Renewables are not just about delivering projects and electricity— they are about delivering a future. Clean energy is both a climate imperative and a once-in-a-generation economic opportunity.

“With this map, we’re making the case for action on where investment is needed, with real locations, real figures and real opportunities for every part of Wales.”

Critical infrastructure upgrades can also be seen, including grid reinforcements to boost connectivity in Mid Wales and create a North–South transmission spine, alongside current and new interconnectors with Ireland and Scotland. These are essential to ensuring clean power can flow efficiently into, out of, and across Wales — unlocking further investment and economic growth.

The collaboration between clean energy and industry associations reflects the shared missions of the two organisations: Net Zero Industry Wales is focused on decarbonising industry and manufacturing, positioning Wales as a clean energy hub and a cornerstone of the UK industrial base; RenewableUK Cymru is leading the shift to clean electricity by embedding renewables into Wales’ wider economic strategy.

Crucially, scaling up renewable energy deployment is not only about creating new value— it’s also about protecting Wales’ existing economic strengths. Without action, carbon-intensive sectors risk further decline.",https://www.wales247.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/247-Featured-Image-1332-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 09:01:54.043724

In January, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality launched its Energy Saver North Carolina program, offering rebates for homeowners and renters to improve home energy efficiency and electrify home systems. The program includes $208 million available for federally funded rebates.

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein applauded the program for its potential to aid the state's economy. ""Energy Saver NC will create job opportunities and put money back in hard-working North Carolinians' pockets while moving our state toward the goal of a 21st century clean energy economy,"" Stein said in a statement.

The Energy Saver NC program aims to reduce energy costs and harmful carbon pollution throughout the state. It offers residents the chance to claim rebates through two separate rebate options. The Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings program offers rebates for whole-home improvements, including insulation and air sealing, as well as energy-efficient doors and windows.

Homeowners can also save money through the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate program. This federally funded program makes it more affordable for homeowners to switch to high-efficiency electric appliances and heat pumps.

Each federal program is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act to help low- and moderate-income households reduce energy costs and electrify their homes. By increasing the affordability of energy-efficient appliances and home upgrades, more homeowners can reduce their reliance on planet-heating dirty fuels and work toward creating a cooler future for our planet.

DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said: ""From insulation of doors and windows to cooking dinner on their new electric stovetop, this critical program will help to improve the lives of North Carolinians on a daily basis.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Energy-Saver-NCimage-recTCWNZfsa5XOuLM.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:02:27.105995

Key recommendations from the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council include increasing investments into energy efficiency programs for low-income households to upgrade their homes and waste less energy.

The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation reviewed the state’s efforts to fund energy efficiency plans during virtual meetings on Wednesday. They also talked about the uncertainty around community solar investments and the rollout of energy storage plans.

Charts shared in the meeting by Carrie Hearne, the executive director of the commission, show that Virginia is 9th in electricity expenditure, which is higher than the national average. This energy use is due in part to the growing number of data centers across the state, which require large amounts of electricity. The state’s high energy expenditure also means that the cost burden for low-income households can be great.

Key recommendations from the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council include increasing investments into energy efficiency programs for low-income households to upgrade their homes and waste less energy.

“Investments in energy efficiency is a very least-cost way to save money, save electricity, save energy, and help reduce pressure on the grid,” Hearne said.

The council also recommended the state rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon credits market which previously was generating funds for the state to invest in energy efficiency and flood resilience programs. Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled the state out of RGGI, a move a judge deemed unlawful, and some lawmakers fear rejoining it will add yet another cost added onto customer’s utility bills.

“If we’re talking about affordability, anything we add to that, no matter what it is, it’s going to cost. So we need to be very careful about adding things to riders,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott.

The commission expressed interest in ramping up nuclear power through small modular reactors. SMRs are not currently operating in the country, but multiple are under construction in other states. Dominion Energy has already selected their North Anna power plant as the site of their first SMR. There is still a long road ahead that will entail selecting the proposals for the projects, getting the proposer licensing, and other requirements.

The commission did not discuss utility sized solar projects, but did discuss the status of community solar in the commonwealth. Community solar allows neighborhoods to buy into small-scale solar projects to have their utility bills reduced based on how much power is generated and how much they bought in.

However, if Dominion’s proposed changes to the minimum bill amount materialize, it could impact those savings. There hasn’t been much movement to expand this program in Virginia, and federal grants for it have recently been paused or terminated.

The Virginia General Assembly has failed to pass bills that would expand energy storage requirements, and ones that have passed have been vetoed by Youngkin. As long-term battery technology advances, some lawmakers are pushing utilities to utilize them more to assist with storing energy from solar and wind projects.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents companies in energy storage, solar, and wind, reported to the commission that there is 56 megawatts of battery storage operational in the state now, 252MW in construction, and 94MW in the proposal stage. There are many battery storage projects in the interconnection pipeline for the regional transmission grid, PJM, to approve. Dominion has multiple pilot projects in the works that look outside lithium-ion batteries as options for their projects.

“These pilots will deliver significant value, not only for the technology developers, they get to test their systems and real world conditions, but also to us, as we help de-risk the technical performance and cost effectiveness of these proposed three (projects),” said Brandon Martin with Dominion Energy. “The real world operating data validating the technology’s ability to enhance the resiliency of the grid and those claims and the cost benefits is real.”

The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation will hold more meetings this fall to get updates on the state’s energy profile and efforts by utilities to meet the VCEA transition to renewable energy sources. They plan to have recommendations for legislation by December.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dscf7040-1024x6831757587186.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=hwVV2xXk,N,,2025-09-11 06:58:40.449135

The project was developed in partnership with AltaSea and Shell Marine Renewable Energy (MRE).

The installation uses floaters that capture the motion of ocean waves to generate electricity. While currently a demonstration site, the project is designed to lay the groundwork for larger commercial-scale operations in the future.

Congresswoman Nanette Díaz Barragán, who has introduced the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act – a $1 billion initiative to scale marine energy nationwide – called the launch a historic step.

“Eco Wave Power made history by deploying its innovative wave energy technology into U.S. waters for the very first time,” Barragán said. “This milestone shows incredible potential for wave energy to power our communities with clean, renewable electricity, while creating jobs and protecting our environment.”

Eco Wave Power CEO Inna Braverman said the launch is aligned with California’s Senate Bill 605, which calls for a statewide roadmap for wave energy. “This project shows that with the right policy, we can turn innovation into reality. And we’re just getting started,” Braverman said. She also announced upcoming projects in Taiwan, India, and Portugal.

AltaSea CEO Terry Tamminen described the technology as ready for global scaling. “Eco Wave Power is one of those exciting technologies that is ready to scale. It’s already around the world, and it’s only going to get bigger because it has solved many of the problems that other technologies have come up against for harnessing something as challenging as wave energy,” Tamminen said.

Michael J. Galvin, Director of Waterfront and Commercial Real Estate at the Port of Los Angeles, linked the project to the port’s climate goals. “The San Pedro Bay Port Complex has big goals to get to zero emissions in the next decade,” Galvin said. “Projects like this are super important to get us there. We can’t do it without localized energy sources.”

At the launch event, state and local officials presented Eco Wave Power with formal recognitions. California State Senator Laura Richardson said the project demonstrated “commitment to energy innovation,” while Los Angeles Councilmember Tim McOsker called it “a remarkable milestone – not just for your team, but for the future of clean energy.”

The event drew international partners, underscoring the global momentum behind wave energy. Sandra Lee, speaking on behalf of CY Huang of I-Ke in Taiwan, said a pilot project is already being prepared at Suao Port. “Just as the LA pilot turns that port into a living laboratory, Suao will become a blueprint for replication across Taiwan’s working harbors — and eventually across the region,” she said.

The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In Oct. 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed on July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it can find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, co-founder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50 percent off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after September 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phaseout timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as electric vehicle charging stations at schools. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports, and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects is becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance issued August 15 made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5 percent of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects is in a position where it’s not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of “zero net energy” by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.

Consultants and sustainability coordinators said that they don’t see the demand for renewable energy going away. “Solar is the cheapest form of energy. It makes sense to put it on every rooftop that we can. And that’s true with or without tax credits,” Strehlow said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/K12climate-post-obbba-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-11 04:58:02.996367

Perry served as U.S. energy secretary from March 2017 to December 2019.
However, the engineering, construction, and licensing of nuclear reactors is a complex and highly regulated undertaking, Fermi stated in its filing.
She previously worked on the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, where she oversaw regulatory coordination.
Fermi’s combined licenses application for 4 gigawatts of nuclear power has undergone a preliminary review and has been accepted for processing by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.","After opening in January, would-be data center builder Fermi America has aggressive plans to build four nuclear reactors near Amarillo, Texas by 2038, but has not yet signed a lease for the land, or one tenant for the massive buildout.

Data center builder Fermi America plans to construct four nuclear reactors along the plains outside of Amarillo, Texas, home to the largest natural gas fields in America and next door to where the U.S. builds nuclear weapons, though the company acknowledges that its management team has “limited experience” in the nuclear sector, and the CEO is currently fighting accusations of fraud.

The details were disclosed in Fermi America’s application for an initial public offering filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CRN has reached out to Fermi America for comment.

The company, focused on landing AI hyperscale tenants, hopes to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “FRMI.”

The building of the “first-of-its-kind"" energy campus called “Project Matador” expects to produce 11 gigawatts of behind-the-meter power for AI infrastructure through the use of four, full-scale Westinghouse nuclear reactors, along with 4.5 gigawatts of gas-fired power, solar PV arrays, and battery energy storage systems.

The 5,263-acre site is owned by the Texas Tech University System and sits beside the Panhandle-Hugoton Gas Field, which is one of the largest known natural gas fields in the U.S., the filing states. Project Matador also abuts Pantex, where the U.S. Department of Energy has built and now disassembles nuclear weapons and stores plutonium, according to the Pantex website.

“Project Matador, is among the largest hybrid infrastructure developments in the United States, that will combine hyperscale data centers and vertically integrated energy assets on a single site,” the filing states. “Project Matador is designed to host power generation, transmission, compute workloads, and chip manufacturing equipment all within the same perimeter.”

In order to hold on to the lease of that property and begin building, Fermi said it must show the lease holder, Texas Tech University, that it has secured “fully and unconditional funding for Phase 1.” If it can’t do that by Dec. 31, it risks losing the lease.

The project is currently in “Phase 0” and development through “Phase 1” is expected to cost at least $2 billion with a target to finish that by December 2026. To win that money and lock up its lease of the land, the company has embarked on the IPO, the filing states. The full build-out across all phases of Project Matador is expected to see a pricetag between $70 billion to $90 billion.

Fermi recently won $100 million in Series C preferred equity funding along with a $250 million loan from the Macquarie Group. The company has also raised $246 million in debt financing since May.

It has applied for a 10-year property tax abatement from Carson County, Texas. The Carson County Commissioners Court may review the request in the third quarter 2025, the filing states.

The company has generated no revenue to date, and expects financial losses to continue “for the foreseeable future” as it builds out its power footprint, Fermi America stated in the filing. It hopes to see tenant revenue begin in 2027, but it does not expect to see fully operating and capital requirements until phase four of Project Matador when it has successfully deployed up to six nuclear reactors on two nuclear islands in 2038.

Fermi plans to deliver a full 1 gigawatt of capacity by the end of 2026, with 46 percent coming from natural gas, 46 percent coming from mobile generators, and 8 percent purchased from the grid.

In May, it began the purchase of turbine and power equipment from Seimens. This includes “a combined cycle gas power plant rated at 487 MW.” Fermi said the equipment has been fully fabricated and is ready for shipment, but it remains warehoused at Siemens staging facilities in Germany, Sweden, Vietnam and China pending final delivery and assembly. Fermi still owes Seimens $134 million plus shipping costs, which are expected to total between $10 million and $12 million.

Once those are delivered, Fermi hopes to have that plant in operation by April 2026.

Fermi America’s CEO and cofounder is Toby Neugebauer, who co-founded Quantum Energy Partners in 1998, which was a private equity firm focused on energy investments. He also founded Windrock Capital, which was acquired by Macquarie. In 2022, he operated GloriFi, a bank that has declared bankruptcy. Fermi’s other co-founder is former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry served as U.S. energy secretary from March 2017 to December 2019.

Nuclear Ambitions

As a “core component” of Project Matador’s power platform, Fermi plans to build four AP1000 pressurized water reactors developed by Westinghouse to provide 4 gigawatts of power to the site, with the first one beginning construction on Dec. 31, 2026, for a 2032 commission and then another in 2034, 2035 and 2036. Additionally ,the company is drafting plans to build another 2 gigawatts of nuclear power from small modular reactors.

However, the engineering, construction, and licensing of nuclear reactors is a complex and highly regulated undertaking, Fermi stated in its filing.

“Our management team has limited experience in the nuclear energy sector, which may hinder our ability to effectively navigate the complex technical, regulatory, and operational challenges associated with Westinghouse Reactor and SMR (small modular reactor) projects,” Fermi America wrote. “This lack of experience could lead to delays, misjudgments, or failure to anticipate critical risks, further increasing project costs and timelines.”

In August, the company hired Mesut Uzman as chief nuclear officer.

Uzman previously worked in the United Arab Emirates, China and Bulgaria and led the successful development of the 5.6-gigawatt Barakah nuclear project in the UAE, which recently celebrated its first year of operation and is comprised of four APR-1400 nuclear reactors. He played key roles in the construction and commissioning of 12 nuclear units in China, including four Westinghouse reactors, the company said.

Fermi also hired Mesut Uzman’s wife, Sezin Uzman, who has been named vice president of nuclear supply chain and compliance. She previously worked on the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, where she oversaw regulatory coordination.

Fermi’s power plans include two gigawatts of small modular nuclear reactors, called SMRs, which are in the early stages of development and deployment globally. Fermi wrote and the technology is still under evaluation.

“The limited availability of commercially viable SMRs poses additional risks. The technology is still emerging, with few operational SMRs globally, and the supply chain for specialized components is underdeveloped,” the company warned.

‘Risk Of An Accidental Explosion’ And Access To Thousands Of Nuclear Professionals

In the SEC filing’s risk section, Fermi said also of concern is Project Matador’s proximity to Pantex, a high security U.S. Department of Energy facility for nuclear weapon assembly and disassembly that is also on the national priorities list as a superfund site. The last nuclear weapon assembled there was in 1991, according to Pantex’ website.

This cuts both ways, Fermi said as it offers “normalization of nuclear activity” as well as logistical resource and infrastructure benefits, but comes with the potential danger of an “accidental explosion” or “catastrophic incident” at either facility.

“In addition, there is a risk of an accidental explosion or other catastrophic incident. Such an incident at the Pantex Plant or on the Project Matador Site could materially and adversely affect Project Matador, including causing significant construction delays, significant disruption of operations and damage to infrastructure and equipment,” the company disclosed.

On the other hand, Fermi said Pantex – the nation’s primary nuclear weapons center – is home to 4,600 “skilled nuclear professionals,” which the company highlighted as a resource for labor at its own facility.

“Our proximity to the Pantex Plant offers us the opportunity to access a highly experienced workforce steeped in nuclear safety culture and expertise,” the company stated. “We believe this proximity to critical United States nuclear and security infrastructure will be highly attractive to our prospective tenants.”

Fermi: Project Matador’s Timeline Is ‘Aggressive’

Nuclear power development in the U.S. has “slowed dramatically,” Fermi said with the most recently certified nuclear plant in Georgia taking 15 years to complete.

Yet Fermi plans to build and switch on the nation’s second largest nuclear generation complex comprised of four traditional nuclear reactors and two small modular reactors — 6 gigawatts of nuclear power — by 2038, 13 years from now.

Fermi is relying on the Trump administration’s push to hurry sign-offs for nuclear power projects. The administration has shortened the approval time for new nuclear reactor license applications to no more than 18 months. The goal is to have three new nuclear plants reach “criticality” by July 2026.

Fermi’s combined licenses application for 4 gigawatts of nuclear power has undergone a preliminary review and has been accepted for processing by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Fermi is holding to a five-year construction cycle for each nuclear plant, basing that on projects that were completed in China and the UAE, it stated in the filing.

However, Fermi acknowledged there are risks to betting that looser regulations will remain in place.

“There can be no guarantee that this executive order will be effective in doing so or that a future Presidential administration will not reverse this executive order,” Fermi stated. “Indeed, certain recent nuclear power plant projects have taken more than ten years from commencement to completion and the timeline in our model to make the Westinghouse Reactors operational is aggressive,” the company stated.

CEO Buffeted By Fraud Accusations, Lawsuits

Fermi America’s President and CEO Neugebauer was previously the founder and CEO of GloriFi, a short-lived bank that marketed itself as catering to politically conservative causes. In July 2022, that business sought $1.7 billion in funding via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with DHC Acquisitions. But it later declared bankruptcy.

In January 2023, Animo Service, an affiliate of GloriFi filed for bankruptcy and the trustee filed adversary proceedings against Neugebauer accusing him of a series of fraudulent transfers and breaches of fiduciary duty.

In February 2023, GloriFi’s bankruptcy trustee did the same, and also filed adversarial proceedings against Neugebauer “alleging a series of fraudulent transfers and breaches of fiduciary duties.”

Then in March of 2023, GloriFi investors filed a lawsuit against Neugebauer alleging “fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentations, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and exemplary damages.”

Neugebauer contests the allegations and has filed his own federal lawsuits against GloriFi investors in Georgia and Delaware under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

In it he takes aim at high-profile conservative power brokers and campaign donors who invested in GloriFi, including Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, Peter Theil’s Founder’s Fund, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. He accuses the group of attempting to wrest away control of the business and oust him as CEO. His suit is on hold while Texas courts wade through the allegations in GloriFi’s bankruptcy proceedings.

In response to an email from CRN, a Citadel spokesperson provided a news story in which a spokesman for Griffin called Neugebauer’s claims “fabricated nonsense.” A LinkedIn message to Founders Fund’s chief communication officer was not immediately returned. And a representative for Ramaswamy could not be located.

In the risk disclosures, Fermi said these legal matters could be a distraction to Neugebauer as he leads Fermi.

“Although Mr. Neugebauer continues to vigorously contest the allegations against him, assert his rights, and pursue causes of action, the Animo/GloriFi Proceedings may attract negative press coverage and other forms of attention to the Company, and at times could divert Mr. Neugebauer’s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company,” the company warned. “We cannot predict the outcome of the Animo/GloriFi Proceedings or the impact they may have on the Company or its financial condition.”",https://www.crn.com/news/data-center/2025/media_15fa8b1b42e9e25661a4d21a862212c7005b0d71c.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-09-11 07:58:57.638525

Here, SAF offers a realistic bridge between growth and sustainability.
With the right mix of policy clarity, investment support, technology choices, and global partnerships, India can not only decarbonise its domestic skies but also emerge as a global hub for SAF supply.","Globally, SAF is gathering pace. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires all EU airports to blend 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050. The United States, under the Inflation Reduction Act, offers tax credits of $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF, tied to emissions reductions of at least 50%. Singapore plans to mandate a 1% SAF blend in 2026, increasing to 3-5% by 2030, and charge a SAF levy to fund supply chain development. Japan targets 10% SAF use by 2030, while South Korea mandates 1% for international flights by 2027.

Airlines are responding. Many carriers have signed multi-year offtake agreements. Corporate travel programmes are also investing in SAF purchases, reflecting a growing willingness to pay for climate-conscious flying.

Yet the challenge looms. Global SAF production in 2024 stood at just 1.3 billion litres – barely 0.3% of total jet fuel demand. Even with 2024 volumes doubling, output remains far short due to weak airline margins and limited incentives. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aviation requires 450 billion litres of SAF annually by 2050 to meet net-zero goals, with SAF delivering 65% of emission reduction. Meeting this target would require investments of nearly $128 billion per year.

India is the world’s third-largest aviation market, with more than 350 million passengers annually. Domestic air travel is growing at 10–12% per year, and fleet expansions at Air India and IndiGo will significantly increase aviation emissions within a decade. Efficiency gains from newer aircraft and better operations will help, but not nearly enough.

Here, SAF offers a realistic bridge between growth and sustainability. Unlike many countries, India enjoys a natural feedstock advantage. It produces around 680 million tonnes of agricultural residue annually, of which 180 million tonnes is surplus. Add to this used cooking oil, non-edible oilseeds, sugarcane by-products like bagasse and press mud, and organic municipal waste, and the potential is significant. With these pathways – Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet – India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF each year, enough to meet a 50% blend by 2030.

India’s successful ethanol blending programme offers valuable lessons. Rising from 1.5% in 2014 to more than 19% in July 2025, it has built supply chains, policies, and production facilities that could provide a springboard for SAF.

India’s SAF story is a classic paradox – abundant feedstock and rising demand on one side, but negligible production and weak incentives on the other. With the right mix of policy clarity, investment support, technology choices, and global partnerships, India can not only decarbonise its domestic skies but also emerge as a global hub for SAF supply.

As automakers and energy firms race to dominate the next frontier of mobility, strategic talent acquisition and R&D innovation have emerged as the linchpins of competitive advantage. For investors, understanding these dynamics is critical to identifying leaders in a market projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22.2% through 2030 Electric Vehicle Battery Market Size | Industry Report, 2030[ 3 ].

The Talent Arms Race: Paying Premiums for Specialized Skills

The EV battery sector's reliance on cutting-edge technology has intensified competition for skilled professionals. In China, where the industry is most advanced, battery thermal management experts now command salaries ranging from $130,000 to $220,000 annually, reflecting the scarcity of expertise in optimizing battery performance and safety Explosion of High-Paying Jobs in China: The Golden Era ...[ 2 ]. Similarly, Huawei and other tech giants are offering seven-figure compensation packages to attract young engineers for autonomous driving and AI-powered battery monitoring systems, underscoring the sector's pivot toward software-driven innovation Explosion of High-Paying Jobs in China: The Golden Era ...[ 2 ].

This talent war extends beyond salaries. Companies are investing in employer branding, sustainability initiatives, and career development programs to retain workers in an industry marked by high attrition—projected to reach 14.6% globally Hiring Trends in Automotive Industry 2023- 2025[ 5 ]. For instance, expatriate technical directors in the EV sector earn up to 50% more than their domestic counterparts, incentivizing firms to expand operations into high-growth markets like India and Southeast Asia Hiring Trends in Automotive Industry 2023- 2025[ 5 ].

R&D Acceleration: Innovation as a Strategic Asset

R&D spending in the EV battery sector has surged, fueled by the need to reduce costs, enhance energy density, and mitigate supply chain risks. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly 90% of global cathode active material manufacturing capacity is concentrated in China, but innovation is diversifying. Breakthroughs in sodium-ion batteries and the adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry are reducing dependence on critical minerals like nickel and cobalt, addressing both environmental and geopolitical concerns Trends in electric vehicle batteries – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 4 ].

Collaborative R&D is also gaining traction. Strategic partnerships between battery manufacturers, automakers, and energy suppliers are accelerating the commercialization of next-generation technologies. For example, SAP's integration of predictive analytics into EV production processes has improved efficiency and reduced time-to-market for new battery models Electric Vehicle Battery Market Size | Industry Report, 2030[ 3 ]. These alliances are not just about sharing costs—they're about creating ecosystems that can rapidly iterate on design and scale production.

Corporate Strategies: Localization and Global Partnerships

To meet the projected $61.31 billion market size in 2024 and its trajectory through 2030 Electric Vehicle Battery Market Size | Industry Report, 2030[ 3 ], companies are localizing production near demand centers. This strategy, however, requires not just capital but also talent. Firms like CATL and Panasonic are establishing joint ventures in North America and Europe, leveraging local engineering talent while retaining core R&D in Asia. Such hybrid models allow for rapid scaling without sacrificing innovation.

China's dominance in battery manufacturing—over 97% of anode active material capacity—remains a key factor, but competitors are emerging. The European Union and the U.S. are incentivizing domestic production through subsidies and tax credits, creating a fragmented yet dynamic global supply chain Trends in electric vehicle batteries – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 4 ]. For investors, this fragmentation highlights the importance of firms with diversified manufacturing footprints and strong R&D pipelines.

Challenges and Opportunities

Despite progress, structural challenges persist. A shortage of skilled workers in manufacturing and advanced technology sectors, exacerbated by misaligned education systems and labor market preferences, threatens to slow growth EV infrastructure roll out + Manufacturing sector + Talent ...[ 1 ].

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) released a final Request for Proposals (RFP) on an expedited schedule for solar and onshore wind facilities. DEEP is pursuing this RFP to seek bids from clean energy projects that could diversify the state’s energy sources, improve electric reliability, and save ratepayers money.

DEEP is working on an expedited schedule to identify late-stage projects that can capture federal tax incentives before they expire pursuant to the federal budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress earlier this summer. Federal tax incentives can make projects more cost competitive for ratepayers, hence DEEP’s effort to solicit bids from projects before tax credits expire. The RFP also allows Connecticut to coordinate with other New England states, including with Massachusetts under its relevant state authority.

“The decision by the federal administration and Congress to eliminate federal tax credits for resources like solar and wind will needlessly drive up the cost of a readily available domestic energy resource at a time that we need to grow all forms of energy supply to support a thriving economy,” said Katie Dykes, Commissioner of DEEP. “DEEP is taking steps to consider projects that can capitalize on these federal tax credits before they expire, as we continue to pursue ‘all of the above’ options to provide affordable, reliable energy supply in the long term.”

This expedited RFP is a follow up to the Energy Action Update webinar DEEP held on July 24, 2025, reviewing the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on clean energy projects, and subsequent the Request for Information (RFI) DEEP released on July 25, 2025, seeking expressions of interest from project developers who believe that they can (1) meet the end of 2027 in service date to qualify for production or investment tax credits authorized by sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) meet the July 4, 2026, start of construction requirement to continue to make use of the production or investment tax credits authorized by sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code.

DEEP also encourages developers to take advantage of DEEP’s Permitting Concierge service (DEEP.Concierge@ct.gov) for any eligible projects planning on using tax credits. DEEP’s Permitting Concierge service will work with developers to prioritize timely completion of any pending DEEP environmental review or permit decisions with the goal of taking advantage of these tax credits before they expire.

DEEP is accepting bids in response to this RFP through October 10, 2025 by 12:00 PM EPT.

However, unlike the previous Plug-In Car Grant offered under the Conservatives until 2022, the new ECG is awarded exclusively based on how sustainable an electric car is.
So, we're taking a look at EV sustainability to try and add some clarity to the sustainable EV situation.
Greg Archer, the campaign group's former UK director, said: 'The valuable minerals mined to make electric car batteries will be used and reused unlike those of oil.
'In comparison only 30kg of metals would be lost each time an electric car battery is recycled – roughly the size of a football.'","The Government launched an Electric Car Grant in July in a bid to invigorate interest in new EVs.

However, unlike the previous Plug-In Car Grant offered under the Conservatives until 2022, the new ECG is awarded exclusively based on how sustainable an electric car is.

In the Government's words, the grant will 'back UK and other manufacturers, with eligibility dependent on the highest manufacturing sustainability standards'.

Car makers are being awarded either a lower Band2 2 £1,500 subsidy or a higher Band 1 £3,750 subsidy depending on how each model complies with these 'sustainability standards.'

And yet everyone from manufacturers to experts and buyers are confused by these 'standards'.

To date, 35 EVs are confirmed eligible for the discounts - but just two for the full Band 1 £3,750 amount.

Why this is the case, the Department for Transport won't yet divulge. What is clear is that the Government is not on a general push towards EVs now, but a push towards only certain EVs.

But EVs and sustainability is nothing new: the debate about how green EVs really are has been raging as long as early adopters first hopped in their zero emission models, and manufacturers have long been investing in sustainable production to make sure they past muster.

So, we're taking a look at EV sustainability to try and add some clarity to the sustainable EV situation. Is green really green?

Government's criteria for what makes a sustainable EV

The Government says its criteria for sustainably produced cars 'is in recognition of the need to address embedded carbon emissions across a vehicle's lifetime, as well as tailpipe emissions'.

At a minimum this means the manufacturer must hold a verified science based target.

These are commitments corporate entities make to reduce their environmental impact and are verified by the independent Science Based Targets Initiative.

As we've briefly mentioned, the Government has tiered its grant so that the amount available per vehicle (on or under the £37,000 price cap) will depend on the level of emissions associated with the production of the vehicle; the most sustainable get £3,750, less sustainable models get £1,500. Those that don't qualify at all will get £0.

Emissions from vehicle production are assessed against the carbon intensity of electricity grid in the country where vehicle assembly and battery production are located.

How does this compare to manufacturer sustainability standards?

While the Government is just now looking at lifetime emissions of electric cars, manufacturers have been doing this for a considerable period.

Swedish brands Polestar and Volvo, both owned by Geely, are leaders in sustainability reporting that goes far beyond just EVs.

Volvo has been publishing an annual sustainability report for years, with its Annual Sustainability Report accessible online all the way back to 2007.

Its first EV was launched in 2019, and along with it came the Carbon Footprint Report: Battery electric XC40 recharge and the XC40 ICE: 43 pages covering everything from 'end-of-life of the vehicle' to 'material production and refining' and the results of a comparison between the XC40 Recharge and ICE driving 200,000km.

This is now a yearly occasion, with every new Volvo EV model being scrutinised to the nth-degree of sustainability.

Then when Polestar appeared on the scene, it not only published annual sustainability reports, but gave customers the option to deep-dive into sustainability while on the Polestar website - you can trace every car's whole sustainability journey if you so wish, and read through exam level sustainability insights.

It's not just Scandi brands though: Ford, Kia, BMW, Mercedes are just a few of the manufacturers who publish sustainability reports with as much weight to them as annual financial reports.

Not granted: The many cheap EVs that likely won't meet the Government's criteria

The Government might have announced the first 35 models that qualify, but we don't and won't know at any point why each manufacturer is awarded the level it is.

What we do know is that it is almost certain that Chinese EVs won't qualify, and that South Korean brands are unlikely to either.

Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on 16 July: 'We don't expect any cars that are assembled in China to be eligible for this scheme.'

As chief executive of EV website Electrifying - and all-round EV expert - Ginny Buckley points out: 'The reality is that car making is a global business. Even if your car doesn't bear a Chinese badge, the chances are part of it was manufactured there.'

So, while you shouldn't put a new BYD with a Government Electric Car Grant discount on your bingo card, also don't put a Dacia Spring, Volvo EX30 or Mini Electric on it either, because as Ginny says, these are all partially made in China.

How sustainable are EVs really? Is battery production the Achilles heel?

The main reason EVs aren't seen as 'green' in some eyes is the battery: Either end of the battery's life - manufacturing and recycling - and the use of raw materials.

There are four essential raw materials battery manufacturers need to secure in order to produce electric car batteries; Lithium, nickel, cobalt and high-purity manganese.

Mckinsey's December 2024 Toward security in sustainable battery raw material supply report found that battery producers use more than 80 per cent of all lithium mined today.

By 2030 though that is predicted to rise up to 95 per cent.

While around 65 per cent of demand for class 1 nickel today originates from the stainless steel sector, the battery sector is set to compete with this contributing to a possible shortage in 2030.

On the other hand about 64 per cent of cobalt – largely a by-product of copper and nickel production – originates in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mckinsey states.

Its analysts predict that demand for cobalt could rise by 7.5 per cent a year from 2023 to 2030, even though the share of cobalt in battery mixes is expected to decrease.

Shortages are unlikely to arise but a resurgence in demand is possible.

Using the latest demand estimates, Mckinsey predicts that in 2030 only about 20 per cent of the high-purity manganese supply will meet the requirement of battery applications, which in itself will only equate to about five per cent of the total demand for manganese.

However, this could change with the rapid adoption of Lithium Iron Phosphate technology.

What's being done to use less raw materials in battery production?

Lithium iron phosphate batteries have become the 'rising star' of the battery industry thanks to the fact that they reduce reliance on cobalt and nickel, which addresses sustainability concerns at the same time as bringing down costs of production.

The International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2024 Global EV Outlook report found that LPF has supplied more than 40 per cent of EV demand globally by capacity in 2023, more than double the share recorded in 2020.

Despite LFP being invented in the US in 1997, China has been the only country mass-producing LFP since 2010. Today two-thirds of EV sales in China use this chemistry, and China produces 70 per cent of the world's EVs.

In Europe and the US, LFP remains below 10 per cent.

However, there's a shift towards LFP batteries in Europe, with BMW announcing LFP batteries in its EVs from this year and Volkswagen confirming it will use cheaper LFP batteries from 2026. They both join Tesla (among others) which has been using LFP batteries in the majority of its new EVs since 2022.

2025 analysis published in Scientific Reports by a team based out of China discovered that replacing nickel-cobalt-manganese batteries with lithium iron phosphate batteries and combined with battery recycling can reduce lithium, cobalt, and nickel demand between 2021 and 2060 by up to 7.8 million tons.

Similarly new lithium manganese-rich (LMR) batteries used far fewer raw materials.

Comparatively composition of LMR cells is around just 35 per cent nickel, 65 per cent manganese, and virtually no cobalt.

There is of course the issue that a massive increase in demand for manganese as LMR batteries become popular will see manganese contributions to manufacturing emission rise.

Human rights issues with EV battery production – Amnesty International report

Last year Amnesty International's study revealed that many of the world's leading EV manufacturers are not adequately demonstrating how they address human rights risks in their mineral supply chains.

Amnesty scored 13 key manufacturers using criteria based on international standards to comprehensively assess their human rights due diligence policies and self-reported practices, with the automakers awarded a score out of 90.

Worryingly none of the companies scored higher than 51/90, with Mercedes-Benz coming out top.

Tesla was second with 49/90 and Stellantis third with 42/90 - showing only 'moderate demonstration' of their commitment to human rights policies, risk identification processes, supply chain mapping and reporting and remediation.

At the other end of the spectrum BYD – the world's largest EV manufacturer – scored the lowest with just 11/90.

Mitsubishi didn't fare much better with 13/90, Hyundai managed 21/90, and Geely Auto (which owns Lotus, Volvo and Polestar) and Nissan both scored 22/90.

Renault and GM sat in the middle with 27/90 and 32/90 respectively (both showing 'minimal demonstration'), while Ford, BMW and VW all scored 41/90 - 'moderate demonstration'.

Amnesty International's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard commented: 'While some progress was made, across the board, the scores were a massive disappointment.'

With the main concern being the 'huge risks for people and the environment' caused by mining for materials, Callamard put pressure on car companies 'to use their massive leverage as global minerals buyers to influence upstream mining companies and smelters to mitigate these human rights risks'.

Presumably human rights will be an area of sustainable practice the Government looks at.

Science Based Targets itself cites 'stakeholder engagement guidance' as a key component, where corporations are guided on 'how to engage with and recognize the knowledge and potential contributions of Indigenous peoples, local communities, and other stakeholders who are (directly or indirectly) affected in positive and negative ways by your company's activities and value chains'.

It's important to note that some manufacturers, despite being owned by conglomerates have marque specific commitments to responsible mining and sustainability.

The Volvo Group for instance says that its Sustainable Minerals Program uses 'strict practices to protect human rights'.

EV battery recycling is crucial: Are EVs step towards a cleaner future rather than the perfect answer?

In 2021, environmental think tank Transport & Environment (T&E) analysed that an EV uses up just 30kg of raw materials with recycling compared to the 17,000 litres of petrol burned by the average car.

Crude oil dependency far outweighed the need for battery raw materials, with the gap set to increase further as technological advancements drive down the amount of lithium required to make an EV battery by half over the next decade.

There's an increasing need for battery recycling as there are sufficient mineral reserves in Europe and the UK to manufacture almost 200 million electric cars – enough to replace about two-thirds of Europe's car fleet if recycling of EV batteries is optimised, T&E found.

The European Union enacted a Batteries Regulation law in 2023, which mandates minimum recycled content targets for various battery types, including EV batteries, and sets recycling efficiency targets for different types of waste batteries.

Overall, T&E states that EVs are also far better for the climate, requiring 58 per cent less energy than a petrol car over their lifetime. With better battery recycling, this will only improve.

Greg Archer, the campaign group's former UK director, said: 'The valuable minerals mined to make electric car batteries will be used and reused unlike those of oil.

'Over its lifetime, an average engined car would burn through a stack of oil barrels, 25 storeys high, creating about 40 tonnes of CO2 and worsening global warming.

'In comparison only 30kg of metals would be lost each time an electric car battery is recycled – roughly the size of a football.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/01/16/100848541-0-image-a-6_1754062596813.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 04:57:58.575825

The electric vehicles (EVs) it plans to build in Kentucky will be based on the RAV4 and the Land Cruiser, said a source familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.

Toyota will end production of the ES sedan of its luxury Lexus brand at the Kentucky plant, the source said. The next-generation version of the model, due next year, will be manufactured in Japan, as the company announced in 2021.

In the US, Toyota currently makes Lexus ES sedans at its Kentucky plant and Lexus TX sport utility vehicles at its Indiana facility.

On Tuesday (Sep 9), the Nikkei newspaper reported that Toyota would consolidate production of Lexus brand cars in the US to a single location in the face of high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

In response to that report, Toyota said that the information was not something announced by the company, adding that it continually reviews its production structure as part of efforts to make ever-better cars.

The project has received approximately $19.7 million in tax credits and grants from the Internal Revenue Service (upon recommendation by the U.S. Department of Energy), California Energy Commission, and Pacific Gas & Electric. The MVR project is scheduled to complete construction in Q2 2026.

Once operational, the MVR system is projected to reduce natural gas usage at the Keyes plant by approximately 80%, generating an estimated $32 million of incremental annual cash flow from energy savings, increasing LCFS credits from a double-digit reduction in the carbon intensity of ethanol produced, and increasing transferrable Section 45Z production tax credits.

“NPL’s construction of the MVR project is designed to deliver a high-return, high-impact upgrade to our California ethanol facility with minimal equity dilution,” said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “The MVR system is expected to materially improve operating margins, strengthen cash flow, and advance our commitment to reducing emissions from the renewable fuel we produce.”

“We are pleased to expand our partnership with Aemetis in pursuit of a shared public-private commitment to advancing California’s clean energy goals through the production of renewable fuels,” said Centuri US Gas President Dylan Hradek. “We have the people and capabilities to provide the energy infrastructure solutions required to build a more sustainable future and look forward to our role in this project.”

The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
As a result, many students, consultants and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take ten years.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In Oct. 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “one big, beautiful bill,” passed on July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it could find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. Educational institutions are significant contributors to climate change: K-12 school infrastructure, for example, releases at least 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to a paper from the Annenberg Institute at Brown University. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, cofounder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50 percent off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phase-out timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as electric vehicle charging stations at schools. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects are becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance, issued Aug. 15, made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5 percent of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take ten years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects are in a position where they’re not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of Zero Net Energy by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.

Consultants and sustainability coordinators said that they don’t see the demand for renewable energy going away. “Solar is the cheapest form of energy. It makes sense to put it on every rooftop that we can. And that’s true with or without tax credits,” Strehlow said.

Solar and storage accounted for 82% of all new power capacity added to the grid during the period, underscoring the growing market demand for renewable energy solutions.

However, the industry faces significant headwinds. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1) and other recent policy measures are projected to reduce deployment forecasts. According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the low-case scenario estimates that the country could lose 44 GW of solar deployment by 2030 — an 18% decline. When compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, the potential reduction could total 55 GW, or a 21% decline.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid.”

The report highlights that 77% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states that supported President Trump in the 2024 election. Eight of the top ten states for new installations are among them, including Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

In terms of manufacturing, the U.S. added 13 GW of new solar module capacity in the first half of 2025, with new or expanded factories in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. The country’s total solar module manufacturing capacity now stands at 55 GW. Nevertheless, the report noted a halt in new upstream manufacturing investments in Q2 due to federal policy uncertainty, putting billions of dollars of private investment at risk.

Looking ahead, solar deployment is forecasted to be 4% lower than pre-HR1 projections by 2030. Near-term growth is supported by ongoing projects, tax credit deadlines, and increased demand for electricity amid rising costs and reduced availability of natural gas.

The report also cites concerns about permitting challenges introduced by the Department of the Interior (DOI), which singled out solar projects for more restrictive review. These actions could affect around 44 GW of planned capacity, with Arizona, California, and Nevada among the hardest hit.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.”

SEIA has urged DOI Secretary Doug Burgum to reconsider these actions, warning that without reversal, the measures could lead to job losses, higher electricity prices, and a less competitive economy.

The report warns that declining solar deployment may hinder the administration’s broader technological ambitions, including AI leadership. In response, SEIA recently released a grid reliability policy agenda calling for coordinated actions by local, state, and federal leaders to strengthen the U.S. electric grid through solar and storage technologies.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/24-2-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-11 04:58:14.012990

Far too often, environmentalists and laborers find themselves on opposite sides of a battle. As Global Citizen co-founder Michael Sheldrick recently explained when he guest edited Katherine Hayhoe’s newsletter, “For years, tensions ran high between coal workers and environmental activists. Unions fought to protect jobs. Activists protested outside power stations. Both sides saw the other as part of the problem.” Michael was talking about the town of Collie, in Western Australia, where tensions had simmered, with environmentalists pushing to eliminate coal and union workers fighting for their jobs. But one day, one of the union leaders got the idea to talk about the future with those who were “obsessed with it” — environmentalists. It was for many, Michael said, the first time each side had talked to the other. And what they discovered was that their goals weren’t in opposition to each other. They all wanted a sustainable future. And through respectful conversations, they co-created a future that worked for all of them. With Western Australia moving toward renewables, the workers realized that their skills made them valuable when it came to new systems like battery storage.

There are similar stories playing out around the world, including in West Virginia, where Bluedot contributor Teresa Bergen told us about coal workers turned tour guides. And our reporter Diane Selkirk shared the story of a town in British Columbia who put this type of respectful conversation to work building consensus for clean energy.

That’s exactly the approach encouraged by U.S.-based Climate Changemakers, which organizes “hours of action” for everyday people — many with no background in climate or politics — to spark conversations with neighbors, coworkers, or friends about what change could look like in their own communities.

These sorts of alliances are crucial in our fight against climate change and Dot salutes the union workers and environmentalists who found common ground. Climate Champ kudos for all of them.

U.S. biofuels policy has been politically divisive, pitting the oil industry against the farm interests that underpin U.S. production of biofuels like corn-based ethanol.

At the heart of the current fight is whether larger refineries should be forced to make up for the biofuel blending requirements that small refineries avoid through federal exemptions. The Environmental Protection Agency has submitted a proposal on the issue for White House review, and its contents have not yet been made public.

""Punishing American energy producers who comply with the EPA’s made-up rules isn’t just unfair, it’s bad for everyday consumers. Americans will pay more at the pump and Utah’s refineries will suffer,"" Lee said in a statement.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, criticized the legislation as a direct attack on rural America. “We shouldn’t even be having a conversation about reallocation,” Cooper said. “This bill simply rewards the bad behavior of a handful of small refineries who have steadfastly refused to blend renewable fuels and are looking for yet another way to dodge their legal obligation.""

The biofuel fight adds another headache for Trump as he tries to keep Republicans united during the effort to pass his budget and avoid a government shutdown. Funding for federal agencies runs out at the end of the month, and the fight over small refinery exemptions is dividing GOP lawmakers just when Trump needs their support.

The EPA recently cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016 — a sweeping move that is now forcing the White House to review how billions of gallons of biofuel blending obligations should be handled going forward.

The EPA offered the White House a preferred option to deal with the exempted gallons, as well as other options that will also be weighed during the review, Reuters reported. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.

The bill, titled the Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act of 2025, would amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from reallocating renewable fuel obligations. Republican Senators John Barrasso, of Wyoming, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, are also sponsors.

VIRGINIA CENTER FOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM AT WHRO

Pound, Va.—Solar on land once mined for coal was a “bit of a notion” for The Nature Conservancy when it purchased the tri-state Cumberland Forest Project in 2019.

That musing escalated to certainty a year later when Virginia legislators approved the milestone Clean Economy Act, which championed renewable power by setting production targets.

“People got jazzed about utility-scale solar with that law,” said Abingdon, Va.-based Greg Meade, who directs TNC’s overarching Cumberland Forest Project. “That appetite convinced us to proceed.”

Carbon-curbing VCEA mandates obligate the state’s two investor-owned electric utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power, to switch to carbon-free portfolios by 2045 and 2050, respectively.

TNC has outlined plans for 509 megawatts of solar—at least 189 MW of panels and 320 MW of storage—via 25 projects across the 253,000 acres it’s restoring in Central Appalachia. That scale of development would be enough to power roughly 85,000 homes.

Granted, those additions would be a relatively small amount of the initial 2,700 MW of energy storage and 16,100 MW of solar (and onshore wind) spelled out at the law’s outset. But they could still contribute to a VCEA-induced solar juggernaut.

Virginia, where utility-scale solar barely registered before 2020, now ranks in the top 10 nationwide for total installed capacity, according to Solar Energy Industries Association statistics. The 7,133 MW up and running are enough to power 817,000 homes. Almost 9% of the state’s electricity now comes from the sun.

However, Virginia’s impressive climb could slow dramatically with recent, Republican-led assaults on federal incentives for renewable energy. In August, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would cancel $156 million in grant funds for Virginia under Solar for All, a program geared for low- to moderate-income households.

This month, the Department of Transportation took aim at offshore wind projects, announcing it would withdraw $39 million from the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port and reneging on a $20 million commitment to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal’s Offshore Wind Development Project.

Norfolk-based Jim Purekal of Advanced Energy United isn’t alone with his fears that solar’s meteoric rise in Virginia will be hamstrung by the slashing of investment and production tax credits wrapped into H.R. 1, signed into law by President Donald Trump on Independence Day.

His disquiet is accentuated in an eight-page report issued by the state’s Commission on Electric Utility Regulation in response to H.R.1.

In Virginia, the budget reconciliation measure would squelch the anticipated development of 15 gigawatts of solar capacity and 1.1 GW of battery capacity by 2035, according to the analysis by Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy policy think tank with an office in Washington, D.C. Combined, solar and batteries would make up the bulk of the 17 GW in energy generation capacity losses in Virginia by 2035, the think tank calculated.

“We need them to make some tough decisions to support clean energy financially and save money for ratepayers.”

Purekal also worries that measures in Trump’s far-reaching federal law will be detrimental to the steady growth of solar jobs in Virginia and the companies that employ 4,938 workers, according to SEIA. Those jobs are connected to the 199 solar companies—27 manufacturers, 80 developers and 92 related entities—across the state.

Virginia’s energy needs are soaring, mostly propelled by a surge in the construction of electricity-hungry data centers. Unconstrained demand for power is predicted to double over the next decade, according to a December independent forecast commissioned by Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.

João Ferreira, a regional economist with the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center, lauded TNC for being spot-on with its gumption for siting solar developments on reclaimed minelands.

While projects in mountainous settings tend to be smaller and cost more per megawatt, Ferreira said, one silver lining is that they often produce more jobs and related economic benefits.

TNC reached some of those same conclusions in its nationwide “Mining the Sun” report released in 2024. One analysis stated that Virginia had enough reclaimed coal mines and other degraded lands statewide—some within the 153,000 acres in the Cumberland Forest Project—to balance the meeting of VCEA’s solar requirements with keeping mature forests and valuable agricultural land intact.

The strategy outlined in “Mining the Sun” was birthed about six years ago when the country’s largest environmental organization grasped that opposing all development on properties it sought to preserve wasn’t a productive approach to conservation. That realization prompted TNC to propose a blueprint for scoring climate, conservation and community victories by siting clean energy infrastructure on minelands, landfills, brownfields and other industrial sites.

It’s significant for TNC’s initiative that the Clean Economy Act requires Dominion to procure 200 MW of solar or wind on brownfields—which include reclaimed minelands—by 2035. The utility is allowed to venture outside its service territory boundaries to do so. A portion of Dominion’s 50-MW Highlands Solar array will be installed on the Conservancy’s Cumberland Forest acreage.

TNC expects to put the entire Cumberland Forest Project up for sale to a like-minded buyer in the next five or six years. It paid $130 million for the acreage in Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.

While functioning solar installations will certainly add to the property’s value and boost returns for investors, Meade notes that the presence or absence of such projects “won’t make or break a deal with the types of potential buyers we’re seeking.”

Still, he added, pushing more megawatts across the finish line equates to higher rewards for restoring the environment and the economies of down-on-their-luck communities.

“The primary benefit of solar on minelands is demonstrating that it can be done at all,” Meade emphasized. “That’s a really big deal.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/325b44b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4443x2333+0+253/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F56%2Fbadaa2814bd5a44627b7ec77d6bd%2Fgreg-meade-dec-2025-at-cf-soalr-site-dec-2024.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 02:57:49.372899

The second category of water tradable permits is water quantity tradable permits.
This case involves both permanent water trading (the trade of water entitlements) and temporary water trading (annual trade of water allocations) (Murray-Darling Basin Authority, 2024[53]).

[8] OECD (2017), The Political Economy of Biodiversity Policy Reform, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264269545-en.","Tradable permit schemes are economic instruments that set an absolute cap (i.e. limit) on aggregate resource use or pollution and allocate permits to firms that can be traded (hence often referred to as cap-and-trade programmes) (Tietenberg, 2006[1]).1 These schemes align with the polluter pays principle by ensuring that those who are responsible for pollution or environmental degradation bear the costs associated with it (OECD, 2016[2]).

By defining a fixed quantity of allowable resource use or pollution, tradable permits provide certainty over environmental outcomes, distinguishing them from economic instruments like environmental taxes, which set prices but do not guarantee specific quantity reductions. This aspect is particularly important in contexts where ecological tipping points exist or where stringent environmental safeguards are needed (Dasgupta, 2021[3]).

Tradable permits are underpinned by two core economic principles: internalising externalities and promoting cost-effective resource allocation (Pirard, 2012[4]). First, tradable permits address market failures caused by externalities – costs or benefits that affect third parties and are not reflected in market prices. By internalising these externalities, tradable permits should ensure that those who use environmental resources bear the full cost of their actions, aligning individual incentives with social welfare (Tietenberg, 2006[1]).

Second, tradable permits create incentives for polluters to reduce their environmental impact at the lowest possible cost (Bovenberg, Goulder and Gurney, 2005[5]). Entities that can reduce their emissions or resource use more cheaply will do so and sell their excess permits to those facing higher reduction costs. This market mechanism aims to ensure that pollution or natural resource exploitation reduction occurs where it is cheapest to achieve, leading to overall cost-efficient reductions in environmental harm (Bovenberg, Goulder and Gurney, 2005[5]).

There are two main ways of allocating permits. The first approach is grandfathering, where permits are allocated to existing entities free of charge, typically in perpetuity. The other approach is auctioning. If permits are auctioned, these schemes can also mobilise finance (Box 5.1).

Biodiversity-positive tradable permit schemes in the fisheries sector are commonly referred to as Individual transferable quotas systems (ITQs). ITQs set specific Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits and issue individual quotas that can be traded among fishers.

One of the motivating factors for the establishment of ITQs is to promote sustainable fishing by shifting fisheries away from open-access regimes that often lead to resource depletion. In several cases (e.g. Iceland and the United States), they have been implemented in times of impending collapse of a fishery (Costello, Gaines and Lynham, 2008[11]). The main arguments for introducing ITQs is that they eliminate the need to “race to fish”, thereby increasing economic returns while reducing overcapacity and overfishing (Sumaila, 2018[12]).

Fisheries managed under ITQs not only show lower collapse rates but also tend to achieve higher profitability, increased fish stock biomass, reduced overcapacity and lower emissions compared to those managed under more traditional frameworks. For example, by 2003, the proportion of collapsed fisheries under ITQs was approximately half that of non-ITQ fisheries (Costello, Gaines and Lynham, 2008[11]). These systems not only halted but, in many cases, reversed the downward trajectory of fish stock health (OECD, 2022[13]).

ITQs are effective in maintaining target fish stocks at sustainable levels, however, they alone are insufficient to address the broader ecological impacts of fishing (OECD, 2017[8]). ITQs are one of several fisheries management tools, most of which increased in use from 2019-20 (Figure 5.1). While ITQs have contributed to stock conservation by aligning economic incentives with ecological health, reducing bycatch, and protecting non-target species, to fully achieve their potential ITQs must be integrated into broader fisheries management strategies, including fundamental measures such as gear restrictions, area restrictions, and fishing seasons, alongside adaptive quota setting and bycatch reduction measures. While ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is often considered the gold standard, its implementation remains limited due to complexity and cost. Additionally, marine protected areas (MPAs) are generally not designed as fisheries management tools, though they may provide indirect benefits for fish stock recovery (Hoshino et al., 2020[14]) (Hoefnagel and de Vos, 2017[15]). Effective implementation requires adapting these systems to the ecological, social, and economic characteristics of each fishery to ensure both stock sustainability and habitat protection (OECD, 2017[8]).

Tradable permit schemes exist also for water management, notably to either address water quantity issues or water quality issues. These systems operate by setting a cap on water use (i.e. water quantity) or pollutant discharge (i.e. water quality) and allocating permits that can be traded among users so that the aggregate cap is achieved at the lowest overall cost.

Water quality trading (WQT) systems have been implemented for reducing or controlling water pollution, reducing the costs of water pollution control following the imposition of a cap on pollutant emissions by regulators (Brears, 2023[28]). They typically involve point sources (such as industrial plants) and non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff), where entities with lower costs of reducing pollution can sell excess reduction credits to those facing higher costs.

The United States (US) established the world’s first WQT system in the 1980s, with WQT schemes now also active in Australia, Belgium (Box 5.4), Canada and New Zealand (Liu and Brouwer, 2023[29]). The United States has implemented water quality trading in various watersheds to reduce nutrient pollution. For instance, the Nutrient Credit Trading programme in the Chesapeake Bay, initiated in 2005, is designed to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus, which contribute to eutrophication in the Bay (DOEE, District of Columbia, 2024[30]). In Australia, the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme (HRSTS) in New South Wales (Australia) aims to manage saline water discharges from industries within the Hunter River catchment and the Protection of the Environment Operations and water trading systems regulate water quality and distribution (New South Wales EPA, 2002[31]). The scheme operates by issuing salt credits that regulate discharge opportunities based on river flow and salinity levels. Participants, such as coal mines and power stations, are required to hold regulated licences and can only discharge saline water during high river flows to minimise ecological impacts.

In New Zealand, the Lake Taupo Nitrogen Trading Programme, launched in 2011, is designed to protect the water quality of Lake Taupo, the country’s largest freshwater lake (Duhon, Kerr and McDonald, 2015[32]). By establishing a cap on nitrogen discharges from land use in the lake’s catchment, the programme allocates Nitrogen Discharge Allowances (NDAs) to landowners and enables the trading of these allowances to manage and reduce overall nitrogen pollution.

The second category of water tradable permits is water quantity tradable permits. These water permits allocate a fixed amount of water rights among users, which can subsequently be traded. This approach aims to enhance water use efficiency and sustainability by allowing water rights to move to higher value uses while maintaining overall water withdrawal limits, thereby helping to protect ecosystems (Brears, 2023[34]). Water quantity trading systems are active in Australia, South Africa, UK and US.

The first formal water quantity market in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, was established in the 1980s, with significant reforms and expansions occurring in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2007, in response to the Millennium Drought, the Australian Government enacted the Water Act 2007, establishing the Murray–Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to create and enforce a Basin-wide plan for sustainable water use. In the Murray-Darling Basin, water trading has allowed allocations to shift to uses with higher economic returns while enabling more efficient resource management (Brears, 2023[34]). While water trading has at times been associated with concerns about social impacts – such as the displacement of small farmers and speculative market behaviour – recent research finds limited evidence to support such concerns. Studies suggest that market mechanisms have generally enabled irrigators to better manage financial stress, adapt to climate variability, and, where necessary, exit farming with more dignity and ease when needed (Wheeler, 2022[35]). Nevertheless, perceptions of inequity and market manipulation persist in public discourse, underscoring the need for transparency and integrity in water market governance, as emphasised in recent reform efforts (DCCEEW, 2022[36]). In 1998, South Africa introduced its water trading system as part of the National Water Act (NWA), which established the legal framework for managing water resources, including the ability to reallocate water use rights through trading. The NWA aimed to promote equitable access, sustainability, and efficient use of water resources across the country.

In US, the Fox Canyon Water Market in Ventura County, California, represents a pioneering example of using tools to address groundwater sustainability challenges (USDA, 2020[37]). Developed as part of California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) of 2014, the market enables agricultural producers to buy and sell groundwater allocations based on their needs (California State Water Resources Control Board, 2024[38]). The system operates as a cap-and-trade programme where groundwater usage is capped, and unused allocations can be traded among producers. Another example is the Stormwater Retention Credit (SRC) Trading Program, implemented in Washington DC by the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE). This program exemplifies an innovative approach to managing stormwater runoff through a market-based approach (DOEE, District of Columbia, 2024[30]). Launched in 2020, the programme incentivises property owners and developers to install green infrastructure or remove impervious surfaces to reduce runoff, earning tradable credits in return.

In December 2020, the United Kingdom launched the Wheatley Watersource trading platform,3 aiming to facilitate water trading and sharing within the Suffolk East water catchment region. The platform enables license holders of water abstraction, such as agricultural users or golf courses, to trade surplus water (Wheatlye Water Source, 2022[39]). While the initiative aims to support drought resilience, its contribution to biodiversity outcomes depends on whether trading operates within a fixed cap that safeguards environmental flows and prevents over-abstraction.

The environmental integrity of tradable permit schemes depends on well-calibrated caps that reflect ecological limits and incorporate a precautionary approach, ensuring they are set conservatively, sometimes below scientifically established thresholds, to account for uncertainty in ecological processes (Halley, 2024[49]). Setting transparent science-based caps that are also enforceable ensures that permit markets function effectively while preventing resource depletion or excessive pollution. The level of precaution needed depends on the predictability of the resource. For instance, in water management, inflows and outflows are generally measurable, allowing for caps to be set closer to the available supply (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). In contrast, fish stocks are subject to complex ecological processes, environmental variability, and data limitations, requiring caps to be set below estimated limits to mitigate the risk of stock collapse (Halley, 2024[49]). This precautionary approach ensures that tradable permit schemes remain robust even under conditions of uncertainty. Periodic reviews and adaptive management strategies should also be embedded in the system design to align with evolving scientific knowledge, changing environmental conditions and policy goals.

Over time, tradable permit schemes in the fisheries and water management sectors have evolved, adjusting caps to improve alignment between economic incentives and environmental objectives. For example, Iceland's ITQ system highlights the importance of tailoring regulatory frameworks to local contexts (Stefánsson, 2024[23]), introducing a system of TACs based on scientific recommendations, in response to declining fish stocks. The ITQs integrate scientific stock assessments to adjust quotas dynamically, ensuring sustainability under changing ecological conditions (Arnason, 2002[51]; OECD, 2017[8]).

In New Zealand, the Quota Management System (QMS) manages one of the world's largest Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), spanning 4.4 million km² and hosting approximately 13 000 fish species. The scheme establishes an aggregate TAC for each stock, measured by volume (e.g. tonnes) in specific zones. The TAC is allocated annually among user categories, including commercial and recreational fishers. Quota owners receive rights to an Annual Catch Entitlement, and financial penalties are imposed on those who exceed their quota to discourage overfishing (Hersoug, 2018[52]). The system has shifted from input controls (e.g. gear restrictions) to output controls (e.g. TACs) and has incentivised fishers to adopt less environmentally damaging and more innovative practices. By setting clear harvest limits and enforcing financial compliance mechanisms, the QMS has helped to significantly decrease fishing effort (Box 5.8).

In contrast to many other countries implementing an ITQ system primarily to restore overfished stocks, the Finnish herring stock biomass had remained fairly stable from 2014 to 2021 and the introduction of the ITQ system was driven primarily by the need to address economic inefficiencies in the fishing sector (Hanstén, Haapasaari and Kuikka, 2021[20]). The previous system allowed open access to the national quota for all registered commercial fishers and led to the ""race to fish"" phenomenon. The open-access quota, which was not scientifically defined and lacked ecological justification, created a highly competitive and unsustainable environment where fishers rushed to catch as much as possible before the quota was exhausted. This management approach often led to mid-season closures, increasing operational inefficiencies in the industry​ (Hanstén, Haapasaari and Kuikka, 2021[20]).

Concerning water management systems, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council introduced a cap, in 1995, in response to concerns about over-extraction, limiting water diversions to 1993–94 levels to balance consumptive use and environmental sustainability. In 2012, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, developed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), set Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDLs) to manage water extraction and ensure the long-term health of the Basin's rivers and ecosystems. This case involves both permanent water trading (the trade of water entitlements) and temporary water trading (annual trade of water allocations) (Murray-Darling Basin Authority, 2024[53]). Allocations are adjusted annually based on inflow conditions and stored water availability. The programme allows users to adapt to changing water needs and availability while promoting efficiency. In the Murray-Darling Basin, water trading has allowed allocations to shift to uses with higher economic returns while enabling more efficient resource management (Brears, 2023[34]).

The Fox Canyon Water Market system, in Ventura County (US), operates as a programme where groundwater usage is capped, and unused allocations can be traded among producers. Groundwater allocations are set within regulatory limits established under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), providing a structured framework that allows for broader participation without risking over-extraction (Brears, 2023[28]). SGMA mandates the creation of Groundwater Sustainability Agencies for each groundwater basin, which are responsible for developing and implementing Groundwater Sustainability Plans. These plans are based on hydrogeological assessments, historical extraction data, and recharge rates to define the sustainable yield – the maximum groundwater that can be extracted without causing depletion or land subsidence. In the case of Fox Canyon, the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency enforces groundwater allocations based on past usage patterns, setting an overall cap to prevent over-extraction. This cap-and-trade system allows water users to trade unused allocations, promoting efficiency while maintaining environmental safeguards (Brears, 2023[28]).

Similarly, the Stormwater Retention Credit Trading Program in Washington, DC, establishes retention obligations that property owners must meet through on-site measures or credit purchases, creating a scalable system that maintains environmental integrity as trading volumes increase (DOEE, District of Columbia, 2024[30]).

In the case of water quality trading programmes, the cap is generally designed based on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), which set the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can assimilate without violating water quality standards (Kroetz et al., 2017[54]). The TMDLs must also account for seasonal variations in water quality and include a margin of safety (MOS) to account for uncertainty in predicting how well pollutant reductions will result in meeting water quality standards (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2024[55]).

In New Zealand, for example, the Lake Taupo Nitrogen Trading Programme, with the aim to restore the lake’s water quality to 2001 levels by 2080, capped nitrogen discharges to historical levels, targeting a 20% reduction from the 2001-05 baseline. Addressing diffuse nutrient pollution primarily from agriculture, by 2012, 128 tonnes of nitrogen were removed, with 11% of pastoral land converted to forestry to reduce inputs into the lake (Duhon, Kerr and McDonald, 2015[32]). The reduction of nitrogen, which contributes to harmful algal blooms, thereby improves aquatic habitats and supports the resilience of native species and ecosystems within the lake and its surroundings (Spicer, Swaffield and Moore, 2021[56]).

Similarly to fishery and water management, a clear and well-defined cap is also essential for the efficiency of the tradable development rights programme. In Brazil's Tradable Development Rights programme (Box 5.5), the Environmental Reserve Quotas are defined based on Legal Reserve (LR) requirements and can be issued only on surplus forest areas exceeding the minimum LR thresholds, which mandate that private landowners maintain a minimum proportion of native vegetation on their properties, varying by biome: 80% in the Amazon, 35% in transition zones, and 20% in other biomes such as the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest (Pinillos et al., 2021[43]). These percentage requirements were established under Brazil’s Forest Code, reflecting a combination of ecological considerations, land-use history and political negotiations, rather than being strictly based on habitat value, ecological risk, or biodiversity decline rates. Properties that fall below these requirements must compensate by acquiring CRAs from landowners with surplus native vegetation, ensuring ecological equivalence between traded areas (Frickmann Young and Castro Scarpeline, 2021[57]).

Other transferable development rights programmes, such as those in Montgomery County and King County in the United States, also use predefined conservation quotas to ensure that as trading expands, urban development remains contained within designated growth zones while protected areas retain their ecological function (Harman, Pruetz and Houston, 2015[58]; World Bank, 2018[44]).

Stakeholder engagement is critical to the successful implementation and operation of tradable permit schemes. A participatory approach, involving regulators, industry actors, local communities, and environmental groups, can enhance acceptance, compliance, and legitimacy. Early consultation helps to identify concerns, mitigate potential conflicts and improve equity in permit allocation (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2015[59]). Transparent governance structures, clear communication and mechanisms for ongoing dialogue ensure that permit systems are perceived as fair, leading to improved stakeholder buy-in and sustained participation (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2015[59]).

For example, the introduction of ITQs in fisheries often leads to uneven economic outcomes, generating both ""winners"" and ""losers"" (OECD, 2017[8]). Limited engagement of some stakeholders in the reform process, notably fishers and their communities, contributed to these disparities. For instance, in Iceland, discontent with the way the initial free allocation of fisheries quotas had led to a distinct set of “winners” was an important driver of subsequent policy reforms (OECD, 2017[8]). This lack of meaningful consultation and participation sometimes resulted in reforms that favoured larger, more capitalised fishing operations, while smaller-scale fishers and their communities faced reduced access to resources and economic hardship.

Regulators can also increase stakeholder engagement by maintaining transparency and regularly reporting performance (Section 5.3.2), not only by involving fishers as quota participants but also by including diverse groups such as small-scale operators, Indigenous communities, and civil society organisations in governance and policy design processes. Regulators foster trust and demonstrate accountability, and building public confidence is essential for gaining social licence and ensuring the success of regulatory frameworks. Moral suasion, through evidence-based communication of the system's benefits, strengthens incentives for compliance, while responsiveness to stakeholder concerns ensures that the framework remains equitable, inclusive, and reflective of diverse needs (Halley, 2024[49]). Effective stakeholder engagement is an important element of successful tradable permit schemes, as demonstrated also by the HRSTS in New South Wales. The HRSTS involves a diverse set of stakeholders, including government bodies, industry representatives, and local communities, all of whom contribute to the decision-making process surrounding salinity management (Figure 5.3).

To enhance governance and ensure continued stakeholder input, the HRSTS Operations Committee was established in 2003, several years after the scheme’s introduction, to improve stakeholder engagement and regulatory responsiveness. The committee advises the NSW EPA on the operation and performance of the HRSTS, serving as a platform for stakeholders to voice concerns, provide input on policy adjustments, and collaborate on setting operational priorities (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]).

Transparency in permit allocation, trading rules, and market operations enhances trust, credibility, and efficiency (Halley, 2024[49]). Publicly accessible registries and digital tracking systems can improve market oversight, reduce information asymmetries, and lower transaction costs for participants. Disclosure of permit ownership, transaction histories, and compliance performance enhances accountability and prevents market manipulation (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). Furthermore, clear reporting and independent verification mechanisms reinforce confidence in the integrity of tradable permit systems.

The continuous evaluation of outcomes and the implementation of system improvements are factors for the success of tradable permit schemes. Regular review cycles, as seen, for example, in the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme in New South Wales, integrate technological advancements and stakeholder feedback to enhance programme effectiveness (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). Moreover, a key component of the scheme is the public registry, which enhances transparency by recording permit ownership, trading activities, and compliance performance (NSW Environment Protection Authority, 2024[60]). This publicly accessible system helps ensure accountability, track market dynamics, and support regulatory oversight, reinforcing trust in the scheme’s governance.

Programmes like the New Zealand QMS and the U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for water quality trading employ robust data-sharing mechanisms, including fishery-dependent monitoring and water quality trading platforms, ensuring participants and the public have access to accurate and timely information (Bentley, 2024[61]; Halley, 2024[49]). Similarly, for the Iceland’s ITQ system, the establishment of a national registry for quota transactions further enhanced transparency, reducing transaction costs and strengthening trust among stakeholders (OECD, 2017[8]).

Similarly, in Australia, the MDB’s success is underpinned by robust institutional frameworks, including transparent water registers, scientifically determined sustainable diversion limits, and independent oversight by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA). These elements have ensured the enforcement of caps on water extraction and provide confidence and to build trust among market participants (Wheeler et al., 2017[62]).

Blockchain technology’s recent emergence offers new opportunities to enhance transparency and accountability in environmental markets. A study on the MDB water market found that inaccessible or unrecorded transactions hinder effective regulation, while the lack of public data contributes to misconceptions, misinformation, and low market confidence (IBM & Arup, 2023[63]). Moreover, there is currently no single entity responsible for the ongoing and effective monitoring of trading in the Basin. To address these challenges, a blockchain-enabled platform4 has been proposed to modernise market operations, ensuring real-time tracking, secure record-keeping, and improved data accessibility (Shahab and Allam, 2020[64]). Blockchain’s decentralised structure provides an immutable ledger, reducing the risks of data manipulation, fraudulent trading, and incomplete reporting. By integrating smart contracts,5 the system can automate regulatory compliance, preventing unauthorised trades and streamlining administrative processes. This approach aligns with the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) Water Market Inquiry (2021[65]) and the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Water Market Reform Roadmap (2022[66]), reinforcing the need for greater oversight, enhanced data-sharing, and more transparent governance mechanisms in Australia’s water markets.

The effectiveness of tradable permit schemes depends on robust monitoring, reporting, and verification frameworks. Advanced tracking technologies, such as satellite monitoring, electronic reporting, and automated compliance verification, can enhance enforcement efficiency. Regulatory agencies should implement strong compliance mechanisms, clear penalties for non-compliance, and independent audits to ensure permit holders adhere to environmental limits. Strengthening enforcement capacity helps prevent fraud, maintain market stability, and uphold environmental objectives.

Effective monitoring tools and requisite capacity can help ensure proper implementation of tradable permit schemes. For example, New Zealand’s QMS has developed enhanced monitoring tools, including on-board cameras and trawl surveys, which have improved compliance and reduced illegal practices such as discarding (Halley, 2024[49]). The system also implements financial penalties and compliance payments, increasing the marginal cost of overfishing and deterring quota violations. Additionally, the QMS includes a ‘balancing regime’ that requires permit holders to align their catch with Annual Catch Entitlements (ACE), linking quota pricing to sustainable harvesting behaviour. However, the effectiveness of this system depends on strict monitoring and enforcement, as weak oversight could lead to overfishing or non-compliance with sustainability objectives (Halley, 2024[49]). Despite these advances, ongoing monitoring remains essential to address ecosystem-wide effects, particularly for non-target species and habitats impacted by some fishing methods (Dasgupta, 2021[3]).

ITQs promote self-policing and compliance by granting resource users a vested interest in sustainable management. By giving fishers a sense of ownership, these systems create strong incentives for responsible practices, including participation in monitoring efforts. Effective monitoring can be further enhanced by engaging fishers directly in the process. The Dutch ITQ system incorporated co-management groups, where fishers participate in monitoring efforts, enhancing transparency and compliance while reducing illegal landings (Hoefnagel and de Vos, 2017[15]). Similar monitoring principles apply to water permit schemes, where robust frameworks ensure regulatory compliance and environmental protection. To facilitate the uptake of tradable water permits, Wheeler et al. (2017[62]) proposed a readiness assessment framework consisting of three key steps: (1) assessing hydrological and institutional needs; (2) evaluating market development and implementation issues; and (3) establishing robust monitoring and review systems.

In Australia, the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme uses continuous real-time monitoring to track saline discharges during high river flows, protecting aquatic ecosystems from salinity spikes that could harm native species and disrupt habitats (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). Monitoring stations along the river measure flow rates and salinity levels, classifying the river’s state into “low flow”, “high flow”, or “flood flow” categories. These real-time data points allow regulators to detect excessive discharges immediately, ensuring that salinity targets are not exceeded and that the total allowable discharge is allocated based on tradable salinity credits (New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, 2003[67]).

For the Fox Canyon Water Market, continuous monitoring ensures compliance, with GSAs required to review and update their GSPs every five years to respond to environmental changes and ensure long-term sustainability (FCGMA, 2024[68]). By integrating adaptive management and market mechanisms, this approach balances water conservation objectives with economic flexibility.

Enforcement mechanisms must also be stringent and include appropriate penalties for non-compliance to deter violations. This can involve regular inspections, audits, and public reporting of compliance status. Transparent and fair enforcement processes build trust in the system and ensure that all participants are held to the same standards. Additionally, regulatory authorities must have the capacity to respond swiftly to violations, maintaining the credibility and effectiveness of the scheme. These enforcement mechanisms are essential for maintaining the integrity of tradable permit schemes, preventing market manipulation, and ensuring long-term compliance with environmental regulations (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2015[59]).

This payment represents the company’s first Advanced Manufacturing Production credit under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Syrah (ASX code: SYR) is an Australian Securities Exchange listed industrial minerals and technology company with its flagship Balama Graphite Operation in Mozambique and a downstream Active Anode Material Facility in the United States. The Section 45X Production Credit relates to Syrah Technologies’ claim in its 2024 tax return filing, connected with the 11.25ktpa Active Anode Material (AAM) facility in Vidalia, Louisiana.

The cash proceeds from this Section 45X Production Credit are held in restricted accounts. Subject to the approval of the US Department of Energy, these funds may be used to finance Vidalia’s operating costs, net of revenue. The company anticipates that direct payments for further Section 45X Production Credits will generally be received during the second half of the calendar year.

Syrah Technologies is eligible for Section 45X Production Credits equivalent to 10% of Vidalia’s production costs, encompassing both material costs and tax depreciation. When the 11.25ktpa AAM Vidalia facility operates at full capacity, Section 45X Production Credits are estimated to be approximately US$7-9 million per annum, or about US$0.62-0.80 per kilogram of AAM, before any phase-down.

The Section 45X Production Credits will be phased down to 75% in 2030, 50% in 2031, 25% in 2032, and will be eliminated from 2033 onwards.

A: We don’t expect to see any reduction in opportunities to use C-PACE financing for new construction projects, renovations, or recapitalizations.
The number of states where C-PACE financing can help get a deal done continue to increase, as Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York continue to make C-PACE financing available more broadly.
Nowadays, deals require complicated capital stacks to get to the finish line, and this expansion of Opportunity Zones allows for these C-PACE/OZ deals to continue.
Q: How big a role has PACE financing played in OZ projects up until now?","The recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) of 2025 has put restrictions on tax credits for renewable energy initiatives. However, Bali Kumar, COO of PACE Loan Group (PLG), doesn’t anticipate any slowdown in the adoption of C-PACE (commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing as a result. In fact, he tells Connect CRE, the OBBB’s expansion of the Opportunity Zone program first enacted in the bill’s predecessor, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, may spur more interest in C-PACE.

Q: Since the recently signed One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) targeted cuts to green funding and renewable energy initiatives, we were wondering how it impacts C-PACE financing. Do you expect a reduction in C-PACE financing as a result?

A: We don’t expect to see any reduction in opportunities to use C-PACE financing for new construction projects, renovations, or recapitalizations. In fact, we expect to see continued growth. The number of states where C-PACE financing can help get a deal done continue to increase, as Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York continue to make C-PACE financing available more broadly. C-PACE is unaffected because there are no federal dollars being used, and there is no federal oversight, since C-PACE is made available under state law. As a private, direct C-PACE lender, we are seeing more and more applications come through the door every day.

One specific impact of the OBBB is that certain renewable energy projects need to start before July 4, 2026, and be in service by January 1, 2027 to qualify for certain federal tax credits. Those projects can be financed through C-PACE (and the tax credit can go directly into the borrower’s pocket, so they can “double dip” !), so we are seeing more projects that want to take advantage of the “double dip” of getting the tax credit in addition to getting 100% financing move more quickly toward the closing table.

Q: One area of the OBBB is the expansion of Opportunity Zones (OZ), which had been a temporary policy initiative and now will be made permanent. Will C-PACE financing opportunities also expand?

A: C-PACE financing works well in OZ deals, and we have done a number of those. Nowadays, deals require complicated capital stacks to get to the finish line, and this expansion of Opportunity Zones allows for these C-PACE/OZ deals to continue.

The CRE industry is still uncovering more of the details of the bill, specifically all of the OZ changes. What we do know is that OZs are ripe for significant redevelopment or new development, which is a great fit for C-PACE financing. Redevelopment deals often require upgrades to HVAC, windows, electrical, elevators, and plumbing, all of which can be financed via C-PACE.

OZ projects are allowed to defer taxes for up to 10 years, with the idea that the deferred taxes encourage investing in designated communities. Though we have seen fewer OZ developments in recent months, we expect that this legislation will encourage new commercial development in these areas.

Q: Interest rates haven’t been cut this year as many experts originally predicted. Is that a positive or a negative for C-PACE and PACE Loan Group?

A: C-PACE financing really does work in any market. In our current “higher for longer” market, C-PACE financing has been useful to blend down the cost of capital for projects that are forced to use more expensive construction debt. The one caveat is that all deals right now are DSCR constrained, so we work with our senior lender partners to ensure our joint capital stacks meet our joint DSCR requirements.

Q: How big a role has PACE financing played in OZ projects up until now?

A: When the original OZ legislation was enacted in 2017, C-PACE was in the early stage of adoption, but the savvier Opportunity Zone investors learned early to use C-PACE financing on each of their deals to juice their IRRs and to spread their investment over multiple deals. There is also duration alignment with these projects, since these projects are long-term holds, and C-PACE is long-term financing.

So, C-PACE wasn’t used as often in the original OZ program because it wasn’t as widely available, or as well known. Now that C-PACE is offered in more states, we expect to see many more qualifying projects during this version of the program.

Q: Are there other aspects of the OBBB that could affect the market for PACE financing, whether positively or negatively?

A: While some clean energy credits are expiring, C-PACE is a great way to finance improvements that otherwise would have qualified for clean energy credits. C-PACE has the dual mandate of funding “energy efficiency” projects which result in operational savings because of increased buildings efficiency.

One additional OBBB benefit we are aware of is that owners will be able to depreciate energy improvements 100% in year one. That’s a new benefit that may cause more sponsors to consider improvements that improve energy efficiency.

With the Biden administration's recent executive actions and the Trump-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) creating a dual tailwind, investors are now presented with a unique window to capitalize on a sector poised for long-term growth. This analysis explores the federal-nuclear partnership's implications for strategic investment opportunities, focusing on infrastructure firms, advanced reactor developers, and the geopolitical resilience of a reinvigorated U.S. nuclear industry.

Federal Initiatives: A Catalyst for Nuclear Revival

The federal government has emerged as a critical enabler of nuclear energy's resurgence. In May 2025, President Trump's executive orders prioritized nuclear reactor development, uranium mining, and private-sector incentives, directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to allocate up to $900 million for advanced reactor demonstrations, including small modular reactors (SMRs) Government Initiatives Fueling Nuclear Energy Growth in the United States[ 1 ]. This aligns with the IRA's broader $369 billion clean energy framework, which includes tax credits and grants for nuclear projects under Section 48C and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS Announce $6[ 2 ].

The DOE's $3.4 billion initiative to expand domestic low-enriched uranium (LEU) production further underscores the administration's focus on securing the nuclear fuel supply chain 11 Big Wins for Nuclear Energy in 2024[ 3 ]. This is not merely an economic play but a geopolitical one: reducing reliance on foreign uranium imports—particularly from Russia and China—strengthens U.S. energy sovereignty at a time of heightened global tensions.

Strategic Investment Opportunities: From SMRs to Uranium Producers

The federal push has catalyzed a wave of private-sector activity. The Nuclear Company, a startup backed by $51.3 million in Series A funding, is evaluating sites for its first fleet of SMRs, with plans to create 100 jobs in South Carolina Nuclear Company Inks Series A Investors, Plans to Hire 100 People[ 4 ]. Similarly, TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates, is constructing the Natrium reactor in Wyoming with $880 million in federal support, blending advanced reactor technology with energy storage capabilities VCs have poured billions into a nascent nuclear technology[ 5 ].

For uranium infrastructure, Cameco Corporation and Cortez Rare Earths have secured DOE contracts to modernize enrichment facilities, ensuring a stable domestic supply of LEU 11 Big Wins for Nuclear Energy in 2024[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric—now publicly traded—have become focal points for investors seeking exposure to SMR deployment and reactor modernization. NuScale's recent $1.2 billion in IRA-related tax credits exemplifies the sector's alignment with federal incentives U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS Announce $6[ 2 ].

Geopolitical Resilience: Nuclear as a Strategic Asset

The global context amplifies the urgency of U.S. nuclear expansion. The World Bank Group's partnership with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to promote SMRs in developing nations highlights nuclear energy's role in addressing energy poverty while reducing carbon emissions World Bank Group, IAEA Formalize Partnership to ...[ 6 ]. However, this also intensifies competition for U.S. firms to secure export markets, particularly in Asia and Africa, where China and Russia have traditionally dominated nuclear infrastructure contracts.

Domestically, the restart of shuttered plants like Michigan's Palisades facility—supported by $1.52 billion in loan guarantees—demonstrates the sector's potential to revitalize regional economies while maintaining grid reliability 11 Big Wins for Nuclear Energy in 2024[ 7 ]. These projects are not just about clean energy; they are about reasserting U.S. leadership in a technology that is central to both climate goals and national security.

Risks and Considerations

Investors must remain

of regulatory hurdles and public perception challenges. Advanced reactor designs require rigorous safety certifications, and the high upfront capital costs of nuclear projects necessitate long-term federal support. However, the IRA's 10-year tax credit window and the DOE's streamlined permitting processes mitigate these risks, offering a degree of predictability absent in other energy sectors.

Conclusion: A Sector at the Inflection Point

The federal-nuclear partnership represents more than a policy shift—it is a strategic repositioning of the U.S. energy landscape. For investors, the confluence of federal funding, technological innovation, and geopolitical imperatives creates a compelling case for allocating capital to nuclear infrastructure and technology firms.

Congress is back from recess, and so is EESI! As the summer comes to a close, we’re coming in hot with solutions for keeping cool and bolstering the electric grid against extreme heat. We’re also featuring a new tool from U.S. Nature4Climate that helps decision-makers learn about nature-based solutions in their state. Need to catch up on what Congressional committees got up to before recess? We’ve got you covered in that corner, too.

This morning, EESI and the Ohio River Basin Alliance co-hosted a briefing on the Ohio River, part of our Resilient and Healthy Rivers series. Missed it? Stay tuned for the recording and key takeaways! Finally, key takeaways are now available for all eight panels of our 28th Annual Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy Forum and EXPO.

Appropriate Measures in the House: The House passed the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2026 (H.R.4553). The bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), allocates $57.3 billion in discretionary funding in fiscal year (FY) 2026–$766.4 million less than 2025. EESI presented an overview of what to expect for FY2026 in our briefing, Understanding the Budget, Reconciliation, and Appropriations.

House Brings Back Great Bill of Fire: Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) reintroduced the Wildfire Grid Resiliency Act (H.R.4490) to improve electric grid resilience to wildfires. The bill would allocate $10 million to the U.S. Department of Energy to develop technology to achieve this goal, including through grants to the National Laboratories. For more on how the National Labs are addressing disaster resilience through innovation, check out EESI’s article, “Wielding Artificial Intelligence, the National Labs Take a Stab at Disaster Resilience.”

House Reacts to Need for Better Alert Systems: Reps. Kevin Mullen (D-Calif.), Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Randy Weber Sr. (R-Texas) introduced the Resilient Emergency Alert Communications and Training (REACT) Act (H.R.5154) to improve alert and warning systems. Specifically, the bill would direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide local emergency officials with $30 million annually to increase their testing, training, and public education of alert systems.

Water Protection Bill Spills Over to the Senate: Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), James Risch (R-Idaho), and Ben Luján (D-N.M.) reintroduced the Headwaters Protection Act (S.2701) to support the country’s forests and watersheds. The bill, if passed, would increase and expand funding for the U.S. Forest Service’s Water Source Protection Program and the Watershed Condition Framework, which together manage U.S. forests for watershed health and provide communities with clean drinking water. Reps. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.) reintroduced the bill’s House companion (H.R.605) in January.

Rivian said that the job cuts were limited to its commercial team, which is responsible for sales and servicing operations.

""We have made some recent changes to the commercial team as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,"" a company spokesperson said, per the Journal, referring to the company's new SUV.

Analysts have projected that the new R2 SUV will start at about $45,000, roughly two-thirds the price of Rivian's current models. The R1S SUV has a starting MSRP of around $77,000, and the R1T pickup begins at about $71,000, per the Journal.

Rivian was just the latest automaker to announce layoffs or production cutbacks in light of recent changes to EV tax incentive programs and the overall automotive regulatory structure.

Electric-vehicle tax credits of $7,500 are now set to end Sept. 30 rather than extending through 2032, as originally planned.

In August, General Motors, which has recently made huge strides in its EV business, announced temporary layoffs for 360 workers at its Factory ZERO facility in Detroit, according to CBS News.

""Factory ZERO is making temporary adjustments to production to align to market dynamics,"" Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesperson, said at the time, per CBS News.

While the expiration of EV tax credits has gotten most of the attention, EV-only companies like Rivian, which do not make any gas-powered vehicles, have also faced other regulatory headwinds.

Specifically, automakers no longer face hefty fines for violating Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Reuters reported in July.

""The decision is one of a number made by Washington to make it easier for automakers to build gasoline-powered vehicles and to make electric vehicle sales more costly,"" Reuters said at the time.

Under the CAFE program, automakers were required to make their fleets more fuel-efficient or face significant fines, which for some companies reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars, per Reuters.

In the alternative, noncomplying car companies were able to purchase credits from EV-only makers such as Tesla and Rivian to bring their vehicle lineups in line with CAFE standards.

Tesla had received $2.8 billion globally under such programs, per Reuters, while Rivian said in a court filing that the change in policy could cost the company $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal.

With the $7,500 tax credit for EVs expiring Sept. 30, those who are thinking about upgrading to an electric vehicle should act quickly to take advantage — unless, of course, you're waiting for that R2 model from Rivian, which is set to begin mass production in 2026.

In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.
According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.
This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.
But, Guyer said, whether a company can make use of IRA credits or not, renewable energy projects are still the cheapest forms of electric generation in Iowa.","Iowa utilities still have a “long way to go” to meet a 2035 net zero emissions goal, especially as changes at the federal level have accelerated the timelines for key wind and solar tax credits, according to the 2025 Iowa Electric Generation Condition of the State report.

The annual report from Iowa Environmental Council said in order to meet this net zero goal, utilities not only have to transition away from coal but also continue to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 30%-60% over the next 20 years.

The net zero goal is consistent with federal goals from 2021 that directed the energy sector to achieve net zero emissions, or emissions that are equal to the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere, by 2035.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change similarly found in 2022 that global greenhouse gas emissions must reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change, including limiting global temperature increases.

Steve Guyer, IEC’s energy policy counsel, said in a webinar Wednesday about the report that climate change costs Iowa businesses, families, governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year.

“I want us to keep in mind that energy, the environment and the economy are actually inextricably linked,” Guyer said.

Guyer, and the report, said coal generation which has the greatest greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, not only “drives climate change” but also has negative effects on public health, creates air pollution, can cause premature death and can even impact corn yields.

“Air pollution does not discriminate,” Guyer said. “Everybody has to suffer, and is burdened by, basically, this impact – not only financially, but otherwise.”

Coal down, wind and solar up

In Iowa, the share of coal-based electric generation has declined consistently since 2010, according to the report. From 2021 to 2024, fossil fuel generation decreased by 9% in the state.

The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019. In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.

Solar increased in 2024 to represent 1% of the share of electricity generation. According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.

“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said. “That places us certainly ahead of any other state as far as the percent of generation from renewables. It also means that we are uniquely positioned to actually achieve 100% carbon free by 2035.”

Geoff Greenwood, the media relations manager for one of Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa’s status as a leader in clean energy is “in large part because of MidAmerican Energy’s clean energy leadership.”

Wind makes up the majority, or 64%, of MidAmerica’s energy mix. Greenwood said in an email that since 2004, the company has invested in more than 7,600 megawatts of wind and 141 MW of solar, and has plans to invest in hundreds more by 2028. According to the company’s website, it delivered “the equivalent of 100% carbon-free energy” to Iowa customers in 2024.

“The environmental benefits of renewable generation are not diminished by the timing of its production—each and every megawatt of clean energy MidAmerican generates contributes to overall emissions reductions and supports our customers’ sustainability goals and Iowa’s leadership in clean energy,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican has made, and continues to make, significant, measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading Iowa’s electric sector in decarbonization efforts.”

The report points out that despite the significant share of wind and solar generation in the state and commitments from MidAmerican and Alliant Energy, to achieve net zero emissions, Iowa has six operational fossil-fuel power plants.

According to the report these plants emitted more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024, along with several thousand tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

Power plants represent about 16% of Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The report shows that agriculture at 29% accounts for the largest share of emissions in the state, closely followed by residential, commercial and industrial fossil fuel use.

Greenwood said MidAmerican has already retired “several coal units” and “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” He noted the existing plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations.

Coal generation in Iowa is nearly 52% lower in 2024 than it was in 2005, and carbon emissions have decreased by 47% in the same time, according to Greenwood.

“The Council’s report itself acknowledges that the electric sector is the only sector in Iowa that has made meaningful progress in reducing GHG emissions,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican is proud to be a key contributor to that progress.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said in an email the company is implementing a strategic plan to “create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities.”

Alliant plans to, by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utility operations to 50% of 2005 levels, and to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040.

According to the spokesperson, the company reduced its 2005 emission levels by 39% in 2024.

“We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our goals remain the same, however, increasing customer energy needs, reliability and resource adequacy requirements and tax policy changes may result in delays in achieving, or revisions to, our goals.”

‘Staggering’ increases in energy needs projected

Guyer said energy demand is increasing rapidly, in part due to the implementation of data centers.

According to the report, which analyzed modeling projections from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO power pool, Iowa has a projected load growth of between 30% and 60% over the next 20 years.

Guyer said that projected load, plus a change in MISO’s rules as to what can count towards a utility’s accredited capacity, means there is a “staggering” amount of energy that will be required in the next 20 years.

“We have a, I’ll just say, a staggering mission ahead of us,” Guyer said. “Not only do we have to try and achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but we have to try and do that while we’re also trying to meet this increase in demand.”

Greenwood said the “exponentially” growing demand for energy noted in the report, means that “a dependable supply during this growth is critical.”

“Our long-term vision remains clear: we are striving to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the reliability our customers expect,” Greenwood said. “It’s crucial that our energy transition balances reliability and affordability with environmental responsibility. Reliable electricity is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”

‘Big beautiful’ law changes timeline for tax credits

Guyer said utilities need to “aggressively move” to make use of the wind and solar credits made available under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.

The massive, Republican-led tax incentive and spending bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” which was signed into law in July, shrinks the timeline for these credits.

Now, to be eligible for the credits, projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be placed in service before 2028, according to the report.

“Even though there was an urgency back with the IRA, that has been exponentially increased now due to the big, beautiful bill,” Guyer said.

Analysts at the left-leaning policy institute found that 102 gas and electric utility companies have raised rates or proposed increases that will take effect in 2025 or 2026.
The increases will affect about 81 million ratepayers, nearly 50% of the nation’s electricity customers, and more than one-third of natural gas customers.
Utility bills are creeping up as America’s electric grid faces rising power demand from artificial intelligence data centers.
Marquez said the faster phase-out of renewable energy subsidies will lead to even higher electric bills because fewer projects will be built.","Many Americans are seeing their utility bills increase. Across 41 states, utility companies have asked for an increase in how much money they can charge customers, according to a recent analysis from the Center for American Progress.

Analysts at the left-leaning policy institute found that 102 gas and electric utility companies have raised rates or proposed increases that will take effect in 2025 or 2026. The increases will affect about 81 million ratepayers, nearly 50% of the nation’s electricity customers, and more than one-third of natural gas customers.

“It’s getting really hard to make ends meet, and I think a lot of families are going to be facing tough decisions,” said Lucero Marquez, associate director of federal climate policy at the Center for American Progress.

Utility bills are creeping up as America’s electric grid faces rising power demand from artificial intelligence data centers. The rate increase proposals also come as the Trump administration is shifting federal support away from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, instead backing nuclear, natural gas and coal. Increasing costs for consumers have been a salient political issue, with progressive groups casting blame on climate change and shifting federal policy. In contrast, conservative groups say policies promoting renewable energy are the cause.

How much are electric bills going up?

When a utility company wants to increase rates for businesses and families, they have to file a request with state regulators. The Center for American Progress compiled public data from filings to public utility commissions and found increases vary by region.

Kenny Stein, vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, told Straight Arrow News that higher bills are “really driven by this massive demand increase from AI and data centers.”

Florida Power and Light, serving 6 million customers, requested $4.2 billion in additional revenue from 2026 through 2029, translating to an average $4.55 monthly increase for residential customers. Duke Energy Indiana won approval for an 11% rate increase affecting 810,000 customers, adding an average of $18.76 to monthly bills starting in February 2025.

Some utilities are seeking even steeper percentage increases. El Paso Electric in Texas requested a 23.23% rate increase that would add an average of $22.39 to monthly bills for 356,883 customers. Idaho Power seeks a 17.35% increase, which would raise the average monthly bill by $21.66 for 640,000 customers, starting in 2026.

In total, the analysis shows that Americans could pay $67 billion more for electricity and $11 billion more for gas through 2028. In Virginia, home to the world’s largest concentration of data centers, Dominion Energy proposed raising the average customer’s electric bill by $21 monthly by 2027, with about half taking effect in July 2025.

Is President Trump breaking his promise?

On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump said he would cut Americans’ electric bills by 50% within a year and a half of his inauguration.

“He’s breaking his promise,” Marquez said in an interview with SAN.

The rise of AI data centers is one factor contributing to increasing prices. Still, Marquez said utility companies are also citing the need to upgrade infrastructure to counter the threat of wildfires and extreme weather, rising costs for natural gas and the desire to increase profits. The cost of maintaining the transmission and distribution power lines is also increasing.

In July, Congress passed a reconciliation package known as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” which adopted earlier deadlines for wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax credits. Marquez said the faster phase-out of renewable energy subsidies will lead to even higher electric bills because fewer projects will be built.

“The consistent attack on renewables is going to hurt Americans,” Marquez said. Moreover, she criticized the push to keep coal power plants open, saying coal is “the worst for our environment and our health.”

Stein said Trump should not have set up expectations of lower utility bills because “electricity prices are very much still state-driven.” However, Stein favors the policy shift away from incentivizing renewable energy.

Is renewable energy to blame?

Conservative groups have backed the Trump administration’s shift away from renewables, arguing that decades of pro-renewable policies are a driving force behind utility rate increases.

“Soaring electricity demand should be good news because it means that your industries are flourishing,” said Mario Loyola, senior fellow in law, economics and technology at the Heritage Foundation.

In an interview with SAN, Loyola said, “Our electricity supply should be elastic enough to accommodate all the new demand that’s coming from the data center boom.” Instead, he says that the electric supply hasn’t kept up with projected demand due to “regulations that have constrained grid capacity.”

Loyola pointed to state-level renewable energy mandates, tax credits, and environmental regulations that incentivized utilities to build more wind and solar while shutting down or regulating coal-fired power plants. As more solar is added, Loyola said it needs a backup supply that can quickly provide power to the grid when the sun isn’t shining. That dispatchable electricity comes from gas power plants.

Because utilities have to back up renewables with power from natural gas, Loyola said consumers end up “paying for all this redundant power,” adding that “there should be hundreds of power plants under construction in the United States right now.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CLEAN-TheStoryName_Getty_featuredImage_Wed-Sep-10-2025.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 20:01:24.075658

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified one of the owners of Revolution Wind.","Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont is ready to make a deal on offshore wind. He just wants someone in the Trump administration to pick up the phone.

The two-term Democrat has been pushing the Interior Department to lift its stop-work order on Revolution Wind, a $6.2 billion project off the Connecticut coast that is 80 percent complete.

“We’re happy to open up the conversation to other sources of energy, including natural gas,” Lamont told me today.

It’s just not clear anyone in Washington wants to talk.

“I have no idea if there’s an ask, what the ask is,” Lamont said. He later added, “The silence has been deafening.”

Connecticut and Rhode Island have sued to lift the stop-work order issued to Revolution Wind. But leaders in both states hope they can strike a deal with President Donald Trump, whose administration allowed Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, to resume work earlier this year after claiming Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul had agreed to permit two natural gas pipelines.

In New York’s case, it was clear that the White House wanted to do a deal to get the Constitution pipeline permitted, Lamont said.

“In our case,” he added, “we’re flying blind.”

Hochul has denied striking a deal, but said she is open to pipeline projects that follow state law.

In a letter to Revolution Wind last month, federal energy regulators said the project had been halted over national security concerns but did not elaborate. Lamont said he has spoken with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright since then, but has not been able to reach anyone since last week.

“I talked to Chris, and he said: ‘I’m a little taken by surprise by this. Let me get back to you,’” Lamont said. “I talked to Doug. It was a good constructive conversation. He didn’t make any promises. He said, ‘I’ll get back to you next week.’”

He added, “I’m just a short phone call away.”

The Interior Department declined to comment. DOE spokesperson Andrea Woods said she could not comment on a conversation between Wright and Lamont.

Burgum and Wright were at an energy conference in Italy on Wednesday promoting U.S. fossil fuel exports. In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Burgum defended the administration’s attempts to shut down wind projects, saying the Defense Department has expressed concerns over radar interference. DOD had previously signed off on the Revolution Wind project.

“A lot of these offshore wind projects were moved through very fast,” Burgum said. “Yes, they were permitted, but they got moved through a very fast, ideologically driven permitting process.”

Revolution Wind, a joint venture of Ørsted and BlackRock, is a 65-turbine project capable of generating enough electricity to power 350,000 homes. It is one of two offshore wind projects under construction that would send power to the six-state New England region, along with Vineyard Wind 1.

In a court filing last week, the project said it was losing at least $2 million a day and requested that a federal judge issue a temporary injunction staying the order by Sept. 22.

Lamont said he had “extensive conversations” earlier this year with Burgum and Wright on how to support new energy infrastructure ranging from hydropower and wind to gas pipelines and nuclear. The pair had offered assurances that wind projects already under construction would be allowed to finish, he said.

“I thought we were aligned,” the governor said.

He expressed worries about what would happen to the region’s electric system if Revolution Wind fails.

“People will complain about electric prices,” he said. “We’ll have more brownouts because we just don’t have much margin for error.”

Preaching but not practicing

The Trump administration’s new Make America Healthy Again strategy emphasizes the need for air pollution research.

But the Environmental Protection Agency has shuttered the country’s preeminent laboratory studying air pollution’s impact on people, writes Ariel Wittenberg. And EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who helped unveil the MAHA strategy, has moved to rewrite regulations to allow more emissions.

“There will be more air pollution to study, and fewer funds and staff with which to do it,” said Laura Kate Bender, vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association.

Johnson breaks with Trump on wind project

Speaker Mike Johnson is defending an offshore wind project in Virginia as the Trump administration halts other projects, Kelsey Brugger writes.

The Louisiana Republican told Kelsey he has spoken with Cabinet members about his support for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, which is nearly complete. The project is the largest planned in the U.S.

“Yes, I’ve talked to the Trump team and there are ongoing conversations about that,” he said. “I understand the priority for Virginians, and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see.”

Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Republican whose competitive district is home to the project, last week expressed her concerns to Johnson that it could be killed.

Killing the endangerment finding with ‘funny math’

EPA didn’t do any new modeling to inform its conclusions that Americans would benefit from revoking the agency’s endangerment finding and scrapping climate rules, Jean Chemnick writes.

Congress requires agencies to consider the costs and benefits of new regulations. Instead, the agency said removing the rules would enrich Americans. EPA’s report also says the rule changes would bring down gas prices through energy dominance.

“It’s a lot of funny math,” said Kathy Harris, director of the clean vehicles program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It is sometimes migraine-inducing trying to understand some of the circular logic they’re using behind some of these justifications.”

An EU EV?

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the Small Affordable Cars initiative during her State of the European Union speech on Wednesday morning, POLITICO Europe reported.

“I believe Europe should have its own e-car,” von der Leyen said, saying future cars will be environmentally friendly, affordable and made in Europe. The proposal was met with boos from members of the European Parliament, particularly those in the center-right European People’s Party who have lobbied for weaker emission targets.

The speech set out the commission’s priorities for the weeks and months ahead, with von der Leyen speaking on a broad set of issues (including a pledge to punish Israel’s “extremist ministers”).

ATLANTA — Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has courted foreign investment to his state and has also talked so tough about immigration he once offered to use his own pickup truck to round up “criminal illegals.” Those key issues collided this past week when immigration authorities raided a battery plant and detained foreign workers, putting Kemp in a tough spot. Can he be both tough on immigration and encourage foreign companies to invest?

Some 475 people were detained in the raid, including more than 300 South Koreans, at the construction site for a battery plant that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution slated to open next year. The battery plant is part of a $7.6 billion complex planned to eventually employ 8,500 people. It was announced and then expanded after trips by Kemp to South Korea to court officials at Hyundai and other firms.

RELATED: Hyundai Raid Spurs Trump Plan to Train US Battery Workforce

The detentions sparked questions in South Korea about its relationship with the United States, especially with Hyundai and its partners. Hyundai has said it’s investing $26 billion in the United States from 2025 to 2028. That includes not only the plant in Ellabell, about 50 miles west of Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group makes electric vehicles, but a separate $5 billion battery joint venture in Cartersville, Ga., a steel mill in Donaldsonville, La., a robotics hub and expansion of the Hyundai plant in Montgomery, Ala., and the Kia Corp. plant in West Point, Ga.

Kemp has voiced support for immigration enforcement but been restrained in the raid’s aftermath.

RELATED: Attorney Says Detained Korean Hyundai Workers Were in US Legally

“In Georgia, we will always enforce the law, including all state and federal immigration laws. All companies operating within the state must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation,” the governor’s office said last week in a written statement.

Protesters near the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 9 stage a rally against the detention of the South Korean workers during the immigration raid in Georgia.

Kemp can’t run again for governor in 2026 and passed up a U.S. Senate race but has entertained talk of a 2028 run for president. He hasn’t yet said anything about whether the raid will have a long-term impact on Hyundai’s investments. On Sept. 5, his office said only that the state Department of Public Safety had coordinated with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to support the raid.

Kemp’s office didn’t immediately respond to further questions Sept. 9.

This is his second term as governor, and he’s declared a goal of making Georgia the “ electric mobility capital of America.” But the Republican has also talked tough on illegal immigration, saying in a 2018 ad that “I’ve got a big truck, just in case I’ve got to round up some criminal illegals and take them home myself,” and backing a state law that requires local jails to check the immigration status of prisoners.

The raid comes as Kemp has been aligning more closely with President Donald Trump’s administration on immigration enforcement and other issues. The governor has a long history of asserting his independence from Trump, which has at times led to headline-grabbing conflict. But Kemp last month announced he would mobilize 75 National Guard soldiers to provide support to ICE operations in Georgia. He followed that by announcing he would send more than 300 National Guard members to take part in Trump’s law enforcement takeover in Washington.

Like most governors, Kemp seeks foreign investment, which has built up most of the auto industry in the South. Kemp has journeyed twice to South Korea to meet with Hyundai and other big investors in Georgia, including electric battery maker LG Group.

Kemp disputes claims that tax dollars were subsidizing the jobs of those detained. His administration says none of the $2.1 billion in projected state and local incentives for the Hyundai complex directly benefits subcontractors who employ detainees.

“Without exception, the Department of Economic Development expects anyone doing business in Georgia to follow federal and state laws,” the department said.

Kemp has welcomed green energy investment and jobs but has clashed with Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff over who should get credit for Georgia’s green energy boom.

Kemp sharply disputes that incentives signed by President Joe Biden spurred investment, saying industries were already coming to Georgia before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022. But if anything, the rush accelerated after Biden signed his climate law.

The 33 additional projects announced by the end of 2024 were the most nationwide, according to E2, an environmental business group. Exact figures differ, but projects in Georgia top $20 billion, pledging more than 25,000 jobs. Hyundai has continued investing even as Trump and congressional Republicans rolled back electric vehicle incentives.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-09/HyundaiKemp0909-1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 20:01:07.732267

JM/bp’s award-winning FT CANS technology and Honeywell UOP’s FT Unicracking process technology, which both use the Fischer Tropsch pathway, will be deployed to produce SPK that complies with strict aviation industry standards once blended with conventional jet fuel.

Once operational, the Bon Wier plant is expected to convert one million tons of biomass annually — using responsibly sourced forest thinnings as feedstock — into 65 million gallons of transportation fuels, including SAF.

At the facility, USA BioEnergy will also implement Honeywell’s Experion® PKS Distributed Control System (DCS) and safety system to ensure optimal performance, reliability and safety.

Tony Wedell, COO of USA BioEnergy, said: “We are excited to add two of the world’s leading technology providers to our team. We are creating the best fully integrated solution in the advanced fuels industry.”

Nick Andrews, CEO of USA BioEnergy, said: “By utilizing forest thinnings for bioenergy production with carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our integration with Johnson Matthey and Honeywell will help us create this fully integrated, alternative fuels solution.”

Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licensing at Johnson Matthey, said: “This project is another great example of FT CANS being deployed at scale to support the decarbonisation of air travel. It builds on our existing pipeline in the USA, showing continued support for projects that contribute to domestic energy security, fuel security, and jobs.”

Rajesh Gattupalli, president of Honeywell UOP, said: “Honeywell is committed to addressing feedstock availability challenges in SAF production and scale by pioneering technologies that expand feedstock options. Through our collaboration with USA BioEnergy, this project is another great example of the important role alternative fuels play in supporting America’s energy security.”

The collaboration on the Bon Wier biorefinery builds on several recent advancements in SAF achieved by each of the companies, including:

USA BioEnergy entered into a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines for the purchase of up to 680 million gallons of SPK. If blended with fossil jet fuel to meet international standards, this quantity could yield 2.59 billion gallons of SAF2, helping to meet International Air Transport Association (IATA) emission goals to achieve net zero by 2050.

JM and Honeywell were recently selected by DG Fuels for a new SAF manufacturing plant in Minnesota, USA.

Posted at 21:58h in Climate Change by Matt Cook

The UK’s shift to a net-zero economy is not just a technical or environmental challenge; it’s a deeply social one. As the nation accelerates its efforts to phase out fossil fuels and expand clean energy, the spotlight is turning to how this transition affects people’s lives, livelihoods, and communities. Increasingly, the question is no longer whether the UK will decarbonise, but how and who stands to benefit or lose along the way.

Two contrasting realities illustrate the current state of play. On one hand, the green economy is growing at pace. Nearly 1 million people are now employed in net-zero sectors, with job growth in 2024 outpacing the rest of the economy considerably, equating to 3% of total UK employment, comparable to the size of the financial services workforce. Labour’s 2024 election pledge to create an additional 650,000 clean energy jobs by 2030 is now a crucial test of political and economic credibility.

But there’s a more painful side to this story. The closure of key high-carbon facilities, such as the Port Talbot blast furnaces, Grangemouth oil refinery, and the recent government intervention to save the Scunthorpe steelworks, has exposed the vulnerability of workers and communities connected to declining fossil fuel industries. These job losses, though modest in national terms, can be devastating locally. Worse, many of them were avoidable with better planning. This mismatch between progress and pain underscores a growing urgency: the UK needs a clear, well-funded strategy for a just transition—one that aligns decarbonisation with good jobs, regional renewal, and social equity.

Supporting A Fair Transition: What’s at Stake?

With both the Conservative Party and Reform UK challenging net zero commitments, the stakes have never been higher. The transition is at risk of becoming a divisive issue, marred by misinformation and political backlash. For instance, the idea that renewables are pushing up energy prices is misleading; it’s the UK’s lingering reliance on imported fossil gas that continues to inflate bills and industrial costs.

A successful, inclusive energy transition must reconcile two forces: the necessary phase-out of high-carbon industries, and the equally critical scale-up of clean energy. But this won’t happen by default. It will require coordinated policy, investment, and societal buy-in.

Building The Foundations: Early Signs of Progress

After years of inaction, the UK is finally beginning to build a more socially aware transition model. In Scotland, the government has led efforts to link climate policy with social justice, establishing transition boards in places like Port Talbot and Grangemouth to manage the fallout from industrial closures.

Westminster is now following suit. Labour’s new government has made a just transition one of its top priorities, particularly in the North Sea. Secretary of State Ed Miliband has framed the move to clean power by 2030 as an opportunity to “reindustrialise our heartlands with good jobs.”

Key initiatives are starting to take shape, such as the Energy Skills Passport, designed to help oil and gas workers pivot into clean energy roles, and the Office for Clean Energy Jobs, Focused on building a diverse, well-paid, and skilled green workforce. GB Energy is a new public energy company that can set high labour and community benefit standards across its projects. These institutions aim not just to build new infrastructure, but to shape a fairer labour market and bring prosperity to regions at risk of economic decline.

Building The Path Forward

A full-fledged Industrial Strategy is now expected, with the aim of spelling out how climate action can drive employment, innovation, and regeneration—especially in left-behind areas. This must include: A Clean Energy Workforce Plan to overcome skills shortages and ensure quality employment, and a Just transition blueprint for key sectors, particularly:

In the North Sea, oil and gas production have been declining for the last 25 years. The challenge now is to orchestrate a responsible wind-down while scaling up renewables, hydrogen, and carbon capture. Done right, employment in the region could increase, not decline. Steel, where replacing blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces (EAFs) powered by renewables could lower emissions and reduce import reliance. However, EAFs employ fewer people, so any transition must include retraining, job guarantees, and local economic revitalisation.

These efforts must be underpinned by credible public finance packages that support just transition goals. For example, the NWF should use its investments to improve job quality, pay, diversity, and social housing. GB Energy, with its £8.3bn budget, should embed fair work standards and human rights commitments across its supply chains. Together, these tools can ensure that the benefits of net zero are shared fairly.

Mobilising Business and Finance

Public funding can set direction, but private finance must deliver the bulk of the transition. That means companies, banks, and investors must embed social goals into their climate strategies.

Already, firms like National Grid and SSE are integrating just transition principles into their corporate plans. The government’s upcoming legislation to mandate transition plans will push more companies in this direction.

In addition, institutional investors and community development finance organisations must adopt place-based investment strategies that tie clean energy development to local economic and social outcomes.

Building Trust Will Deliver Success

Ultimately, no transition will succeed without public backing. To build support, the UK must modernise its approach to citizen engagement. That includes: Giving communities a real say in local planning decisions or offering shared ownership models for renewable projects. New alliances are needed—between government, business, labour, and civil society—to put people at the centre of climate action.

The UK’s clean energy transition is picking up speed—but also facing resistance. To remain on the right path, the nation must show that climate action and social justice can go hand in hand. That means not only cutting emissions but creating good jobs, empowering communities, and closing regional divides.

A just transition isn’t a luxury or a slogan—it’s a necessity. If done right, it could unlock a new era of inclusive prosperity. If neglected, it risks deepening inequality and derailing climate goals altogether.

The next five years will be decisive.",https://www.lewisdavey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pexels-mikhail-nilov-8542538.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 20:58:01.137207

Macroeconomic Data and Sectoral Timing The utilities sector's repositioning is closely timed to macroeconomic data cycles.
Conclusion The utilities sector is not merely weathering the inflation-interest rate cycle—it is engineering a gains leg through strategic foresight.","The utilities sector is quietly building a case for outperformance in the current inflation-interest rate cycle, driven by a confluence of structural demand, regulatory tailwinds, and strategic repositioning. As macroeconomic data releases loom—ranging from U.S. employment figures to global inflation metrics—utilities are leveraging long-term infrastructure investments, regulatory clarity, and sector-specific tailwinds to insulate themselves from volatility while positioning for gains.

Structural Demand and Regulatory Tailwinds

The surge in electricity demand from data centers is a defining trend. According to Deloitte's 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook, data centers now account for 6% to 8% of U.S. electricity generation, with projections of 11% to 15% by 2030 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook[ 1 ]. This growth is not merely cyclical but structural, driven by AI, cloud computing, and digital transformation. Utilities are responding with grid-enhancing technologies, such as advanced conductors, which could quadruple transmission capacity by 2035 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook[ 1 ]. These investments are critical as the sector anticipates $36 billion to $60 billion in infrastructure spending by the end of the decade 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook[ 1 ].

Regulatory frameworks, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), further bolster this momentum. While policy uncertainty under a potential new administration remains, the IRA's incentives for green technologies have already spurred investment in nuclear and energy storage The top 6 trends shaping the energy sector in 2025[ 2 ]. This creates a dual advantage: utilities can hedge against inflation by securing long-term contracts for clean energy projects while benefiting from tax credits that offset capital costs.

Strategic Repositioning Amid Macroeconomic Uncertainty

Utilities are also recalibrating their business models to navigate inflation and interest rate dynamics. For instance, new tariff structures are shifting transmission costs from residential to commercial users, such as data centers 2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook[ 1 ]. This not only stabilizes revenue streams but also aligns with central banks' focus on inflation control. As the Federal Reserve prepares to release key inflation data in late 2025, utilities with diversified cost bases and regulated returns are better positioned to absorb rate hikes than cyclical sectors.

Global M&A activity underscores this strategic shift. PwC's analysis highlights a surge in deals aimed at securing energy supplies and diversifying risk Global M&A trends in energy, utilities and resources[ 3 ]. For example,

and Capital Power are expanding their portfolios to balance fossil fuel assets with renewables, ensuring resilience against both regulatory and macroeconomic shocks. Such moves are particularly relevant ahead of global energy price data releases, which could trigger volatility in unprepared sectors.

Macroeconomic Data and Sectoral Timing

The utilities sector's repositioning is closely timed to macroeconomic data cycles. Wood Mackenzie's 2025 global power market outlook notes divergent paths in Asia, Europe, and the U.S., with the latter facing policy uncertainty and rising costs The 2025 global power market outlook: divergent paths in a transforming energy landscape[ 4 ]. Utilities are capitalizing on this divergence by locking in long-term contracts and hedging against currency and commodity swings. For instance, Asian utilities are accelerating solar and storage investments, while U.S. firms focus on grid resilience and nuclear expansion The 2025 global power market outlook: divergent paths in a transforming energy landscape[ 4 ].

As key data releases—such as U.S. nonfarm payrolls and global manufacturing PMIs—approach, utilities with strong balance sheets and regulated earnings models are likely to outperform. Their ability to decouple from short-term interest rate fluctuations, while benefiting from inflation-linked revenue streams, makes them a compelling play in a tightening monetary policy environment.

Conclusion

The utilities sector is not merely weathering the inflation-interest rate cycle—it is engineering a gains leg through strategic foresight. By aligning infrastructure investments with regulatory tailwinds, adopting innovative tariff structures, and timing M&A activity to macroeconomic data cycles, utilities are positioning themselves as a safe haven for capital. As central banks navigate the delicate balance between inflation control and growth, the sector's resilience and long-term visibility make it a standout candidate for outperformance.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 20:58:19.127833

Today, with federal EV tax credits expiring at the end of September and policy focus shifting, California is again stepping into the driver’s seat by proposing its own financial incentives.
California’s New Incentives The CARB report suggests that any new program would differ from the federal credits in key ways.
Instead of tax credits, buyers could receive point-of-sale rebates, allowing them to benefit immediately rather than waiting until tax season.
California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator.","California is once again at the center of the nation’s automotive and energy policy debate. With federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits set to expire this September, the state is considering whether to create its own replacement program. This would not only affect car buyers but could also reshape the national conversation on emissions rules, vehicle affordability, and the balance of power between state and federal regulators.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a report on August 19 recommending that the state consider “backfilling” the federal credits with its own point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other incentives to keep EV sales moving. The details remain vague, but the intention is clear: California wants to keep its aggressive zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) goals on track, even as Washington scales back related programs.

But California has been here before. This is not the first time the state has clashed with the federal government over vehicle regulations - and it likely won’t be the last.

California has a unique history when it comes to vehicle emissions. Decades before the federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), California was already regulating air quality in response to its smog problem.

When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, California was granted a waiver that allowed it to set its own, stricter emissions standards. Other states were given the option to adopt California’s rules, and some states have done so.

Today, eleven states follows California’s lead. This waiver authority has made California an outsized force in shaping vehicle propulsion. Automakers cannot ignore a market of this size, which means California’s rules often become de facto national standards.

Clashes With Washington

California’s regulatory independence has not always sat well with Washington. Under different administrations, the federal government has either supported or resisted the state’s authority. During the Obama years, California partnered with the federal government to create a unified fuel economy and emissions program, giving automakers a single set of national rules.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA rolled back certain emissions standards, sparking legal battles with California, which insisted on enforcing its own tougher rules. The state formed alliances with other states and even some automakers to defend its position. Today, with federal EV tax credits expiring at the end of September and policy focus shifting, California is again stepping into the driver’s seat by proposing its own financial incentives. These ongoing disputes highlight a deeper question: should environmental and automotive policy be driven by national uniformity, or by one state acting as the policy leader?

California’s ZEV Mandate

The discussion over tax credits cannot be separated from California’s ZEV mandate. Under CARB’s plan, automakers must steadily increase the percentage of EVs they sell, with the ultimate goal of phasing out new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035.

This is one of the most ambitious policies in the country, and automakers are scrambling to meet the targets. Some states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have pledged to follow California’s lead, while others remain skeptical. For consumers, this means that vehicle availability will increasingly be shaped by government mandates and not by market demand. Even if gas-powered cars remain popular, automakers will need to balance that demand with regulatory compliance.

California’s New Incentives

The CARB report suggests that any new program would differ from the federal credits in key ways. Instead of tax credits, buyers could receive point-of-sale rebates, allowing them to benefit immediately rather than waiting until tax season. Incentives may vary depending on income level, vehicle type, or price, so luxury EVs could receive lower rebates while affordable models get more support.

Additionally, any new program would be tied to yearly funding availability, meaning that if budgets tighten, rebates could shrink or disappear. This approach could make the system more flexible, but it also introduces uncertainty for buyers trying to plan their purchases. In the past the state of California and other states have run out of money in the EV fund and left buyers with nothing.

For California residents, the promise of continued incentives is welcome news, but the reality is more complicated. EVs still come with challenges beyond sticker price. Even with rebates, EVs are often thousands of dollars more expensive than comparable gasoline cars. California has built more chargers than any other state, yet many regions remain underserved, and home charging is not always an option, particularly for renters.

EVs also tend to depreciate faster than gas vehicles due to rapid advances in technology and concerns about battery life. Insurance rates are higher on electric vehicles as well. A large expense is electricity rates which are going up across the country. Without a state-supported used EV credit, buyers in this segment may face steeper hurdles. Incentives may help address some of these issues in the short term, but they do not solve the bigger structural challenges of EV adoption.

One of the key criticisms of EV subsidies is that they often benefit wealthier households. Data from federal programs has shown that a large percentage of credits went to buyers in higher income brackets because these households are more likely to purchase new cars, and EVs remain disproportionately concentrated in the premium market segment. California may attempt to address this with scaled incentives, but questions remain about whether the system can truly deliver benefits to everyone. Meanwhile, working-class families who rely on affordable used cars may find themselves subsidizing programs that they cannot realistically take advantage of.

Automakers and the Industry Impact

For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight. The state accounts for nearly 12% of U.S. auto sales, and when you include the other states that follow its rules, the market share becomes impossible to ignore. Manufacturers that fail to meet California’s requirements face penalties, while those that comply can earn credits to sell or trade.

This system has created an uneven playing field, favoring companies with strong EV lineups. Tesla, for instance, has profited significantly from selling ZEV credits to competitors in the past. If California establishes a robust new rebate system, it could further tilt the market toward EVs, encouraging automakers to prioritize them even more, take greater loses on each vehicle.

At its core, this debate is about whether government policy should drive technology adoption or whether the market should dictate the pace. California argues that aggressive incentives and mandates are necessary to address climate goals and push the auto industry forward. Critics counter that these policies distort the market, forcing automakers and taxpayers to shoulder costs that may not align with consumer demand. They also warn of unintended consequences, such as reduced affordability, lack of charging stations, and strained electrical infrastructure.

California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator. With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt — whether they’re ready or not.

For some wealthier car buyers, this could mean continued financial support when purchasing an EV, but it also raises questions about long-term effectiveness. For taxpayers, it means another debate about where funds should be directed and increased taxes for residents. For the auto industry, it underscores more loses on vehicles that are designed by one states demands.

As history shows, when California moves, the rest of the country often feels the impact. The next few months will reveal whether the state can successfully design a program that keeps EV sales going without overburdening its citizens with more increased taxes. But one thing is certain: decisions made by California will burden at least 11 other states and this is a real issue to watch.

Dive Brief:

Prometheus Hyperscale, a data center developer, is teaming up with Conduit Power to deploy bridge and backup power infrastructure to serve at least two liquid-cooled data centers it’s building at ENGIE battery installations in Texas, the companies said on Sept. 3.

Conduit and Prometheus said the deployments could eventually scale up to 300 MW of gas-fired generators and batteries at each site. They expect the first deployment to come online next year and additional deployments in “2027 and beyond.”

Conduit’s hybrid power infrastructure will take advantage of existing interconnection capacity at the ENGIE sites, allowing Prometheus to begin operations before connecting to the grid, Conduit Power CEO Matt Herpich said in an interview.

Dive Insight:

Data center operators facing years-long grid interconnection queues are increasingly turning to bridge power solutions, often anchored by relatively small natural gas generators and grid-scale batteries.

As Conduit’s timeline suggests, the wait for smaller gas generators is significantly shorter than that for larger gas turbines, which turbine manufacturing executives have said are backordered for several years.

“Creative energy mixes can transform projects that might otherwise be unviable into attractive opportunities for hyperscale developers [with natural gas infrastructure] developed first to ensure a stable, on-demand power source,” said Duane Morris partner Robert Montejo, a real estate lawyer who works with data center and energy clients.

David Carroll, chief renewables officer and senior vice president for ENGIE North America, said in a statement that the company’s “collaboration with Prometheus demonstrates our shared approach to finding innovative approaches to developing, building and operating projects that solve real world challenges.”

While stressing the timeline is “not set in stone,” Herpich said Conduit could deploy its bridge power solutions for a five-year initial term as Prometheus builds out its first two data center campuses. Once those facilities connect to the grid, the gas engines could remain as backup or move to other sites requiring bridge power, he added.

Conduit’s gas generators and batteries would likely operate independently from ENGIE’s batteries, with the generators providing baseload power for the data halls and the Conduit batteries smoothing power flows and providing post-outage black start capabilities, Herpich said.

Despite buzz about the potential for utility-scale power infrastructure behind the meter at large data center campuses, Herpich said hyperscalers tend to prefer hybrid or colocated power solutions that pair onsite generating resources with a connection to the transmission grid. Fully “islanded” power infrastructure redundant enough to match the reliability of the main grid is “priced way beyond what most of these guys want to pay,” he said.

Hybrid power solutions also help data center developers and end users power up faster while remaining aligned with ambitious emissions-reduction targets, Montejo said.

“All of the hyperscalers have strict sustainability goals, [and] blending natural gas, solar and batteries addresses the need for cheap, reliable power and reduced carbon emissions,” he said.

Prometheus is no exception. The company says its flagship data center campus, a 1.2-GW facility under development in Wyoming, will be fully carbon-neutral thanks to a combination of “low-carbon, low-water-intensity natural gas” generation backed by verified carbon offsets.

“Prometheus is committed to developing sustainable, next generation digital infrastructure for AI … we cannot do this alone,” Bernard Looney, chairman of Prometheus Hyperscale and former CEO of oil company BP, said in a statement. Looney nodded to ENGIE’s “existing renewable energy assets and expertise as a major player in the global energy transition.”

For Conduit, data centers are a new market. Herpich said his company has about 20 behind-the-meter and merchant gas and battery installations in operation or under development at oil and gas production sites in West Texas, each around 10 MW.

The first of those deployments will connect to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid later this year, Herpich said. They will take advantage of ERCOT’s interconnection process for generating facilities under 10 MW, which typically takes 12 to 18 months, Herpich said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dL1L0j-PqfGCwC92MnD46C0NVtmsBn9Cm1XHmdE5-zI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTkxMjgxMDI1X0thUmxBU0YuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-10 18:59:50.622216

EV sales hit a record 9.9% of the market last month — up from 9.1% in July, the report said. The increase follows the enactment of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill, which phases out a $7,500 credit for new EVs on Sept. 30.

“The current surge in EV sales is being driven by product innovation, motivated dealers and an urgency ahead of the IRA tax credit phase-out,” Cox Automotive Senior Analyst Stephanie Valdez Streaty said in a statement Wednesday.

As part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, consumers who buy a new plug-in electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle can claim up to $7,500 as a federal tax credit for the purchase. Consumers who buy a used clean vehicle for $25,000 or less from a licensed dealership are entitled to as much as $4,000 back on their purchase.

But that won’t last much longer. The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit is scheduled to end in 20 days as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July.

EV sales began exploding shortly after the bill’s signing, increasing 26.4% in July compared with June — their second-highest month on record. Eleven brands said they had their best EV sales of the year in July, including Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford and Honda.

In August, EV sales hit a new record high of 146,332. The average transaction price for an EV last month was $57,245 — up 3.1% compared with July.

Tesla sold the most EVs, though sales were 6.7% lower in August compared with a year earlier. Its share of U.S. EV sales fell to 38% as the company suffers from an aging lineup and increased competition from other automakers.

“The one constant in the automotive business is that fresh product sells well,” Streaty said. “While Tesla’s Model Y update has slowed the company’s sales decline, it’s not getting easier for the EV pioneer because the market is now flooded with all-new, fresh EVs from mainstream competitors. Consumers have more choice than ever.”

General Motors reported last week that its EV sales jumped to an all-time monthly record in August, driven by strong demand for its Chevrolet Equinox EV, Cadillac LYRIQ and GMC Sierra EV.

Sales of Ford Motor Co.’s Mustang Mach-E were up 35.3% in August compared with a year earlier, while sales of the Hyundai Ioniq 6 were up 29.6%, according to the automakers.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/August_EV_sales_record,N,,2025-09-10 18:01:43.856380

As national economic policy aims to reshore domestic manufacturing, states and localities are eager to attract manufacturers and secure high-impact projects for their communities.

Incentive programs include tax credits as well as direct grants that can materially impact project economics, reduce the cost of facility development, enable equipment acquisition, and provide workforce training. Understanding how to navigate, negotiate, and stack these offerings can be the difference between a good deal and a transformative one.

Federal Tax Credits

On the federal level, we often target the underutilized New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program. Designed to spur private investment in economically distressed communities, the now-permanently authorized federal NMTC program is a powerful tool for manufacturers seeking to secure affordable financing to subsidize expansion of operations, acquire or modernize equipment, or boost working capital with job-creating investments.

At its core, the NMTC program provides investors with a federal tax credit spread over seven years. Community Development Entities (CDEs) allocate the $5 billion in tax credits each year in exchange for qualified investments. Manufacturers expanding their facilities or purchasing new equipment in qualifying census tracts should take advantage of below-market, flexible financing from NMTC-enhanced loans or equity-like capital with favorable terms including longer interest-only periods, lower rates, or subordinated debt structures. The indirect financing structure and tax credit investment often bridges financing gaps that traditional lenders may otherwise hesitate to fund. On average, they result in a net benefit of about 20% capital subsidy for each qualified project at the end of the seven-year compliance period.

To be eligible, manufacturers’ expansion projects must be located in a qualified low-income community and meet certain community impact standards. Many industrial zones across the U.S. meet these requirements, making manufacturers prime candidates. While community impact standards may vary among the allocating CDEs for each project, emphasis on job creation and quality, innovative technologies, revitalization and rural development and other similar benefits to the local community are key drivers to a manufacturer’s success in receiving awards under the program. NMTC financing requires careful structuring and coordination with CDEs, tax credit investors, and project lenders. However, when properly executed, the benefits are significant: enhanced liquidity, lower borrowing costs, and long-term growth in underserved areas.

State Incentives

States continue to expand their offerings and offer a myriad of programs to capture manufacturers’ reshoring investment. States are competing to attract and retain manufacturing operations in their states and businesses should consider these programs when scouring capital investment.

There are two types of incentives – statutory incentives and discretionary incentives. Statutory incentives, such as tax credits for research and development activities, are fixed and do not require advance application or approval from the state. These types of tax credits, which may or may not be refundable, are usually provided regardless of industry, with excess credits permitted to be carryforward to future tax periods. Discretionary incentives are those that are legislatively approved and often require application and approval from a states’ incentive authority. Our focus is on discretionary incentives.

Types of Discretionary Incentives Offered

Discretionary incentives are generally funded by: states accessing federal programs, like Community Development Block Grants; an appropriation by a state economic development agency from an established program; or from a direct state budget appropriation. Local jurisdictions may also be authorized to provide incentives, which are usually funded by a return of taxes paid, or an abatement of tax. Most large projects will qualify for a stack of incentives that layer benefits.

The sums committed by states can be staggering – Michigan has offered up to $6.2 billion in benefits to attract a semiconductor manufacturer, and states will often provide grants that exceed $100,000 per new job created. The race is on for states to develop attraction programs while the federal government is pushing foreign manufacturers to invest in U.S. facilities.

The type of activities which qualify for incentives include:

Acquisition of real estate for new construction as well as leasing of existing facilities

Construction of improvements

Rehabilitation of existing facilities to modernize and/or increase production or efficiency

Purchase and installation of machinery and equipment and related support items

Training of employees

Research and development activities

Warehousing and logistics

Below are the primary programs offered by the states. The particulars vary state-to-state, with some states more heavily incentivizing activities in key sectors, such as clean energy, high tech manufacturing, agriculture and life sciences. Other states incentivize based on geographic location within the state, with a focus on increasing employment in areas of high unemployment. Generally speaking, states offer the four types of discretionary incentive programs.

Enterprise Zones Type Programs

Enterprise zone programs leverage benefits based on the amount of investment in a project and the new jobs, or jobs to be retained. Eligible projects require a minimum investment and creation of a minimum number of full-time jobs. Benefits are usually scaled based on total investment and job creation. These programs include a variety of benefits, such as:

Grants – direct payments

Forgivable Loans – upon completion of milestones achieved

Refund of employee withholding taxes on new jobs

Exemption from sales tax on construction materials (based on the prevailing state sales tax rate, 6% – 8.75%)

Utility rate reductions

Utility tax exemptions

Construction jobs refundable tax credits

Sales tax exemption for machinery, equipment and other personal property used in manufacturing facilities.

Historically, grant funding would often come at the outset of a project to assist in project launch. Many programs have transitioned to a post-performance model to reduce the risk to funding and eliminate the potential for “clawbacks” (repayment) if the project fails to meet agreed upon targets which are based on the amount of investment and the new (or retained) jobs created.

Depending on the program, advanced funding may be possible for ordering long-lead machinery and equipment.

Businesses located within state specific enterprise zones may also be eligible for:

Property tax exemptions for machinery and equipment/pollution control facilities.

Utility tax exemption for gas, electricity and similar excise charges.

Workforce Incentives

Workforce development programs are typically designed to reimburse businesses for eligible training activities or to provide training via a public-private partnership. As with all incentives, tracking the training activities and relevant expenditures is critical to capture reimbursements.

Qualified training includes classroom training, on-the-job training, seminars, workshops, pre-packaged training courses, and related workforce development instruction, including:

Withholding tax credits for job creation and training.

Reduction and/or elimination of local income tax withholding and payroll taxes.

Local Incentives

Counties and municipalities have varying authority and discretion to develop their incentive portfolio, but they, like states, are clamoring for manufacturers’ attention.

The leading incentive used by localities is tax incremental financing (TIF). TIF leverages anticipated future property tax revenues to support the financing of a project. Funds are generated by growth in the Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV) of properties within locally designated districts over a period of years. Businesses utilize the revenues generated by their investment as memorialized in redevelopment agreements that are subject to approval by the local governing authority. Payments are typically provided in bi-annual installments following a project’s completion. Upfront funding may be available if the community agrees to issue bonds for the anticipated increase in EAV.

Development costs that may be eligible for TIF include:

Surveys and BEA assessments

Site preparation

Building rehabilitation

Fixtures and leasehold improvements

Financing costs

In addition to TIFs, localities have also provided the following for new build or expansion projects:

Local sales tax exemptions on eligible equipment

Property tax abatements (real and personal property)

Infrastructure support (roads, water, power).

Strategic Considerations

Foley’s attorneys and Public Policy & Government Relations team secure incentives and credits across jurisdictions by combining strategic planning, legislative advocacy, and direct engagement with state and local authorities. To assist clients’ expansion projects, Foley recently supported the passage of state legislation expanding the use of Tax Incremental Districts (TIDs) in Texas, which enables clients to fund infrastructure improvements and operational costs. Foley also played a key role in securing a state sales and use tax exemption for equipment and software purchases—providing immediate and material savings for their new facility expansion.

Programs like TIDs and Enterprise Zones have proven instrumental in funding public road access, utility upgrades, and other critical infrastructure for clients, while delivering substantial tax benefits tied to job creation and capital investment.

To fully realize these advantages, manufacturers must understand the legal and operational commitments tied to each incentive. Milestone revisions, while often possible, require proactive engagement with the governing jurisdiction. Annual compliance and reporting are also essential, particularly as incentive terms age and institutional knowledge at the project site may fade. Tracking both the promised benefits and the actual receipt of funds is key to avoiding clawbacks.

Finally, the structure and duration of the incentive term deserves close attention. Shorter benefit periods may offer greater business flexibility and reduce exposure to repayment risk. With thoughtful front-end planning and dedicated compliance protocols, manufacturers can maximize the value of these programs throughout the life of the incentive.

The opportunity is clear: federal, state, and local governments are focused on investing in U.S. manufacturing. Manufacturers who strategically plan and structure their projects accordingly can capture millions in benefits—and position themselves for long-term success in the U.S. market.",https://www.foley.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Made-in-the-USA-Tax-Incentive-Article-Image-1536x1024.jpeg,N,,2025-09-10 20:58:05.918796

The U.S. power system is facing a period of unprecedented stress. Demand for electricity is growing rapidly due to the expansion of data centers, accelerating electrification, and renewed industrial growth, yet many of the grid and generation projects needed to meet this demand are mired in permitting delays, procurement barriers, and long planning timelines. Left unaddressed, these challenges risk undermining reliability, raising costs, and slowing progress toward public policy goals. To provide timely guidance, The Brattle Group, commissioned by Clean Air Task Force (CATF), has produced a new report identifying a suite of near-term, practical strategies to help system planners, utilities, and decision makers navigate these obstacles and maintain a reliable and affordable power system, while meeting states’ economic development and clean energy goals.

We invite you to join CATF and The Brattle Group for a webinar featuring a brief overview of the report’s findings, followed by a panel discussion with regulatory, policy, and large-customer experts. The conversation will explore how proven tools—such as grid-enhancing technologies, self-supply models, and more proactive scenario-based planning—can be deployed today to optimize existing infrastructure, accelerate electricity infrastructure deployment, and more quickly respond to mounting load growth. The discussion will highlight how utilities and regulators can take immediate steps to future-proof the grid, minimize costs and emissions, and lay the groundwork for an electricity system capable of meeting rising demand in a timely, affordable manner while simultaneously achieving economic development and clean energy policy objectives. This is a critical opportunity to engage with practitioners on actionable solutions that can be implemented now to ensure the U.S. power system remains robust in the face of rapid change.

The bill makes sweeping changes to U.S. energy policy that are expected to have meaningful and enduring impacts on power generation and capacity buildout in the medium term, especially for solar power. The bill sets abrupt deadlines on solar project eligibility for the Investment and Production Tax Credits (ITC and PTC), which have provided robust and predictable financial support for solar projects since they were last amended in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Many solar projects already in the planning or financing stages of development will likely lose eligibility for these credits, casting doubt on the future of solar energy in the U.S. and the wider impact this will have on the electric grid. In a recently published report, available to FactSet users, FactSet’s Energy team modeled the effects of the OBBBA on solar buildout in the U.S. through 2030 and investigated the second-order consequences the bill will have for other generation types amidst a period of unprecedented load growth. Some of our key findings are as follows:

Batteries Bolster Solar Development

As solar projects become more expensive to build, co-locating them with battery storage systems may help increase project profitability, especially in areas of high solar penetration. Storage projects retain ITC and PTC eligibility under the OBBBA, though with stringent foreign-content requirements, making them relatively more financially attractive than solar projects. These earned tax credits can be used by developers to support the financing of co-located solar projects that might otherwise face cancellation, which in turn will provide zero-marginal-cost charging to the storage systems. Moreover, in a period of high load growth and grid strain, batteries can take advantage of increasingly high and volatile intra-day price spreads in power markets, buying low during peak solar production and selling during peak demand hours in the early evening. FactSet’s forecast assumes that most currently planned solar projects co-located with batteries will be completed due to this competitive advantage, although trade uncertainty and foreign-content requirements may limit wider storage buildout.

Coal Endures

Given high projected load growth, constrained solar buildout, and favorable regulation and policy signaling from the Trump administration, FactSet Energy assumes that many planned coal retirements will be delayed in the coming years. Rather than shut down due to regulatory pressures and costs, such as the EPA’s MATS program, we assume that coal plants will only retire due to age. As such, coal generation is projected to decrease less than overall capacity, with generation even rising marginally in some parts of the country. Coal will continue to compete most directly with natural gas-fueled power in the market, vying to defend its position as a baseload generating asset. Its successful durability will thus likely be sensitive to any changes in natural gas competitiveness, including delivery networks, turbine supply chains, and domestic gas production.

Seasonal Shifts in Gas Burn

In both PJM and ERCOT, two regions with the largest projected load growth, we forecast higher gas burn growth in the winters than the summers. This is due to two reasons: first, while solar installations will slow, capacity will continue to grow, with associated solar generation peaking in the summer. Second, seasonal load profiles themselves will change, as anticipated loads, like data centers and electric vehicles, are less sensitive to weather patterns and can operate flexibly during periods of grid strain. This seasonal change may have significant impacts on pipeline infrastructure throughput in PJM and surrounding regions during severe cold snaps, given the additional strain of heating demand for natural gas.

Conclusion

The passage of the OBBBA has shifted the financial realities of energy markets, and developers now find themselves trying to navigate a new regulatory landscape amidst significant uncertainty related to trade barriers, power demand, and public policy. The impact of the changes to the ITC and PTC remains to be seen, especially considering high supply chain risk for both solar panels and gas turbines, but any impacts will be complicated by substantial projected data center-driven load growth.

This blog gives an overview of the jobs study produced for the Oregon Energy Strategy technical analysis, focusing on the high-level methodology and key takeaways. View the August 14, 2025 Jobs Analysis Presentation for more detail.

Background & Methodology

CETI partnered with Phil Jordan, Mitch Schirch, and Sophia Chryssanthancopoulos of BW Research (BWR) for this analysis, which estimates employment impacts across Oregon’s energy sectors: Electricity, Fuels, Buildings, and Transportation. BWR is a national leader in economic modeling and produces the United States Energy and Employment Report (USEER) every year for the U.S. Department of Energy. CETI worked with BWR previously to produce the Net-Zero Northwest-Workforce analysis.

BWR uses input-output modeling to generate employment estimates based on investments in the economy over time. In this case, BWR used energy and investment data from the energy modeling led by Evolved Energy Research to estimate impacts to Oregon’s energy employment. BWR modeled impacts from the energy modeling Reference Scenario, a least-cost pathway that incorporated high levels of both energy efficiency and end-use electrification, and alternative modeled scenarios that changed assumptions from the Reference Scenario to examine key questions.

The jobs modeling produced employment for each sector by industry group, detailed occupation, wage tier, and region (East/West Oregon) for 2024 and every five-year increment from 2030-2050. The modeling estimated direct, indirect, and induced employment effects. Direct jobs are those associated with the initial economic activity of a given investment or activity, and indirect jobs are those associated with the supply chain connected to that initial economic activity. Induced jobs refer to employment based on the additional household spending resulting from the direct and indirect employment generated.

The jobs figures presented in this analysis can inform workforce development strategies by identifying required educational programs, training, or certifications to support growing sectors. Uncertainty exists in any model, and these jobs estimates are directional to give a sense of scale of future energy employment demand in Oregon. As with the energy modeling, the jobs modeling provides information to consider the broader effects of different choices and priorities for Oregon’s energy system.

Key Findings

The jobs modeling found that Oregon stands to gain energy jobs under the Reference Scenario and all six modeled alternative scenarios:

‍In 2035: Between 9,200 – 16,500 additional jobs over 2024 employment (7-12% increase from 2024) ‍

In 2050: Between 15,400 – 26,200 additional jobs over 2024 employment (11-19% increase from 2024)

It is important to note that the jobs modeling shows the future of demand for employment spurred by investments in Oregon’s energy economy but does not address any current workforce limitations. The magnitude of employment demand indicates the need for workforce planning to avoid labor shortages and bottlenecks that could create barriers to achieving the new electric generating potential, efficiency, and electrification upgrades indicated in the energy modeling.

Electricity sector jobs supporting transmission, distribution, and additional electric capacity drive these job increases, while the Transportation sector experiences the largest job displacement. In line with CETI’s Net-Zero Northwest-Workforce findings, Transportation jobs decrease in fueling stations and vehicle maintenance as vehicles shift from gasoline-powered, internal combustion engines to electric vehicles.

In terms of specific occupations, electricians see the largest occupational demand in 2035 with nearly 2,000 net new jobs from 2024, representing an 82% growth over current energy sector electrician employment. Most of these electricians are in the Electricity sector, with additional jobs in the Buildings and Transportation sectors. Other occupations with significant demand in 2035 include construction laborers as well as heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers.

BWR also modeled the regional distribution of jobs in East and West Oregon, based on geography defined in the energy modeling. The analysis found that energy employment under the Reference Scenario in East Oregon grows 33% by 2035 and 75% by 2050, with developments in renewable electricity generation and transmission responsible for most of this growth. In West Oregon, total employment under the Reference Scenario grows more modestly—by 5% by 2035 and 7% by 2050—driven by growth in the Electricity and Buildings sectors and offset by job displacement in the Transportation sector.

Next Steps

Overall, while the modeling shows that Oregon would gain energy jobs under all modeled scenarios, the employment impacts are not equally distributed. The significant scale of renewable electricity generating capacity in East Oregon would require high levels of construction and development. Additionally, some subsectors, such as fossil fuels and conventional fueling stations, would see employment displacement.

Additional research is needed beyond the projected job estimates in this report. Next steps for ODOE could include a comprehensive workforce analysis to assess implications of meeting Oregon’s future energy needs. The goal of such an exercise would be to identify gaps in current and estimated occupation-level employment and inform strategies to support and expand workforce development efforts to promote a just transition. Examples of this type of analysis include the Massachusetts Clean Energy Workforce Needs Assessment and Washington State Residential Energy Workforce Gap Analysis.

""Without accessible charging options, electromobility will remain the privilege of a small group.
Prague must ensure that every resident has the opportunity to make the switch,"" Prague Deputy Mayor for Transport Zdeněk Hřib said.
Widespread public charging is a key step in clearing the air in our cities, as it helps more people switch away from polluting gas-powered cars.
While convenient public charging is great for topping up, charging at home with solar panels can bring your ""fuel"" costs down to almost nothing.","Finding a good parking spot in a big city can feel like a small victory. But finding one with an available electric vehicle charger? That's often a whole other level of difficulty.

Prague is rolling out a brilliant solution that uses something already on every street to make charging simple and accessible.

The plan, according to Prague Morning, is ambitious. The city is aiming to install 1,500 new EV charging stations by 2026 and a total of 6,000 by 2030. But the clever part is how they're doing it. Instead of major construction projects, Prague is simply retrofitting its public lampposts into convenient curbside chargers.

The cost of the project is reportedly estimated to be 493 million Czech koruna (around $24 million).

For anyone who owns an EV, a plan like this is a huge relief. It's a direct answer to ""range anxiety"" — the stress that comes from not knowing where your next charge will be. It means more options, less waiting, and more confidence to ditch gas cars for good.

""Without accessible charging options, electromobility will remain the privilege of a small group. Prague must ensure that every resident has the opportunity to make the switch,"" Prague Deputy Mayor for Transport Zdeněk Hřib said.

And the benefits go beyond just convenience. Widespread public charging is a key step in clearing the air in our cities, as it helps more people switch away from polluting gas-powered cars.

This idea of using existing infrastructure is catching on elsewhere, too. A project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for instance, is putting new chargers in public parks. Meanwhile, a startup is turning streetlights in Detroit into charging stations. And to keep the network strong, some companies are even creating ""self-healing"" software to fix broken chargers remotely.

For EV owners, the savings can get even better. While convenient public charging is great for topping up, charging at home with solar panels can bring your ""fuel"" costs down to almost nothing.

This combination of accessible public and affordable home charging is what makes the EVs sustainable. If you're curious about making the switch to solar, you can use a free tool from EnergySage to easily compare quotes from trusted local installers.

Prague's simple and effective approach serves as a great model for other cities. Hřib summed it up perfectly: ""This is a concrete step toward a cleaner, healthier city. Investing in emission-free mobility makes sense from ecological, economic, and social perspectives.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pragueimage-recLHTA1OqtRUTdvP-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 17:00:56.449320

Hedge funds are betting against oil stocks and winding back shorts on solar in a reversal of positions that dominated their energy strategies over the past four years.

Since the beginning of October and through the second quarter, equity-focused hedge funds have — on average — been mostly short oil stocks, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of positions on companies in global indexes for sectors spanning oil, wind, solar and electric vehicles. That’s a reversal of bets that had dominated since 2021, according to the data, which are based on fund disclosures to Hazeltree, an alternative-investment data specialist.

Over the same period, funds have unwound short bets against solar stocks. The analysis, which is based on a universe of some 700 hedge funds representing about $700 billion in gross assets also shows that portfolio managers have stayed net long wind in the period.

There has been “a bottoming out with some of these clean energy plays,” said Todd Warren, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners Pty. That trend has “really occurred at the same time as we’ve seen — in the oil patch — some concerns with regards to supply and demand balance,” he said.

The analysis shows that more hedge funds were, on average, net short stocks in the S&P Global Oil Index than net long for seven of the nine months starting October 2024. By contrast, net longs exceeded net shorts in all but eight of the 45 months from January 2021 through September 2024.

The development coincides with a rise in oil supply as some OPEC+ member nations act to preserve their market share. Joe Mares, a portfolio manager at Trium Capital, a hedge fund managing about $3.5 billion, notes that ratcheting up output has “not historically been great” for the oil industry. Evidence of an economic slowdown in the US and China, combined with an expectation that global oil inventories will continue to rise through the rest of 2025, means there’s growing skepticism toward the sector.

Once investors take in “the general slowdown in everything,” the question then becomes, “who’s buying the oil?” said Kerry Goh, Singapore-based chief investment officer at Kamet Capital Partners Pte.

Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tall Trees Capital Management LP is short oil stocks because “we see much lower oil prices, especially in 2026,” said Lisa Audet, the fund’s founder and chief investment officer.

Investors may get further insight into the supply-demand balance as early as this week, with OPEC set to release its monthly market analysis. Updates are also due from the US Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency. On Monday, oil held close to two-month lows.

In the US, meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s quest to add supply in an effort to bring down the price of oil has unsettled local producers.

The Dallas Fed’s latest quarterly energy survey, published on July 2, shows negative sentiment among oil companies toward the Trump administration’s policy on the fossil fuel. One respondent in the anonymized study said the administration’s implied price target of $50 a barrel is simply unsustainable for the industry. Another spoke of the “chaos” caused by current US trade policies, adding the volatility will drive companies to “lay down rigs.”

Meanwhile, the outlook for solar and wind stocks is starting to improve.

​​The analysis of Hazeltree’s data shows that the average share of funds that were net short stocks in the Invesco Solar ETF dropped to 3% in June. That’s the lowest percentage since April 2021, when green equities were trading near record highs. The number of funds net long stocks in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF reached a 30-month high in February this year. Those positions fell back in June, but net longs still dominated shorts overall.

Other hedge fund managers said AI has the potential to trigger a generational swell in energy demand that is likely to give new support to renewables.

“The market is telling you that AI is the biggest thing we’ve seen in our entire careers,” said Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at London-based Selwood Asset Management LLP, which manages about $1.6 billion. To meet energy demand from AI, renewables will need to play a big part, not least “because they’re the fastest to market,” he said. Renewables are likely to meet more than half of the required additional generation capacity by 2035, BloombergNEF said in a report last month.

In China, green stocks are now enjoying a rebound after its solar industry started addressing overcapacity concerns. After losing about half its value between the end of 2021 and 2023, the Solactive Select China Green Energy Index — which includes solar giant Longi Green Energy Technology Co. — has advanced around 19% from an April low.

In the US, Trump administration attacks on green energy — including a rollback of Biden-era subsidies — have already contributed to over $22 billion of clean energy projects being canceled or delayed since January, according to an analysis from the E2 advocacy group.

Yet, for a number of fund managers, the decision to slash green subsidies helps end some of the policy uncertainty that had prevented investors from moving into wind and solar.

“At least now we know what the rules are going to be and so people can go back to evaluating these as businesses,” Mares said.

The final version of Trump’s $3.4 trillion budget bill — dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill — was actually more favorable toward some corners of the renewables market than Tall Trees Capital’s Audet expected. Utility-scale solar, for example, has emerged as a relative winner, she said.

For green investors, it’s been “less bad than expected,” said Nishant Gupta, founder and chief investment officer of Kanou Capital LLP, an energy transition-focused hedge fund. “There’s been more protection around US domestic production than expected.”

And this year’s tariff wars have coincided with a broad rebound in green stocks. Since Trump first unveiled his proposed tariffs on April 2 — dubbed Liberation Day by the White House — the main S&P index tracking clean energy stocks has added about 18%. Over the same period, the main S&P index for oil companies is down around 4%.

Much of the clean-energy rebound has been driven by solar. The Invesco Solar ETF, a widely tracked exchange-traded fund packed with solar stocks, is up more than 18% since April 2.

More hedge funds continue to be short stocks in the Kraneshares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF than long — a constant since 2021 as China has steadily displaced Western manufacturers. But the share of net shorts dropped to 2.87% in June, which is the second-lowest level in almost half a decade.

At the same time, there’s an expectation among fund managers that the continued rise in sales of EVs globally will reduce the need for petroleum. That matches BloombergNEF estimates, which anticipate a 25% annual increase in EV sales this year. BNEF also expects that about 40% of vehicles on the road could be electric by 2040, displacing 19 million barrels of oil a day by that year.

The strategy shift among funds reflects the fact that economic growth without low-carbon energy is now inconceivable, according to Trium’s Mares.

“If we are going to continue to grow both in developed and emerging economies, we’re going to need a lot of energy,” he said. “A big chunk of the marginal growth in energy over the last 10 years has come from renewables and it’s hard to see why that isn’t going to continue.”

Methodology

Bloomberg Green analyzed anonymized weekly data that around 700 hedge funds disclosed to Hazeltree, from January 2021 through 27 June 2025. The hedge funds in the Hazeltree database vary in terms of assets under management, and the analysis is not weighted by hedge fund assets or size of position held. Collectively, gross AUM for the hedge funds analyzed is around $700 billion. Total assets under management in the hedge fund industry were around $4.7 trillion, net, at the end of the second quarter 2025, according to Hedge Fund Research. Bloomberg also interviewed hedge fund managers on their oil and energy transition bets and on trends from the data analysis.

Hedge funds mostly provided their data to Hazeltree via prime brokers. There is a possibility that some positions may not be disclosed. These will not be included in Hazeltree’s data or in the Bloomberg analysis.

Hazeltree’s data reports percentages of the hedge funds that held net long positions and net short positions for a specific stock. Bloomberg’s analysis categorized roughly 230 stocks based on key ETFs or indices for a sector, and further calculated a sector-wide monthly average. In some cases, the same company could be included in different sectors. Four stocks didn’t appear in the Hazeltree data provided to Bloomberg.

ETFs and indices used in the analysis are S&P Global Oil Index, Invesco Solar ETF, First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF and KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF.

(Adds reference to oil price in ninth paragraph. An earlier version corrected the third paragraph to clarify that $700 billion for 700 funds reflects gross aum; and made the same clarification in the Methodology section.)

China ought to disband its military, Fentanyl smugglers should turn themselves in and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell might as well empty his desk.

There is nothing President Donald Trump now is more laser-focused on—and his devoted cabinet chiefs as equally obsessed over—as the irrational attacks they have unleashed on U.S. onshore and offshore wind. Previous months of growing restrictions and disappearing incentives exploded last month into a full-blown offensive that took back hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, is about to revoke legally awarded construction permits years in the making and shut down projects now being built—including at least one that’s nearly done.

Wind power is not perfect but it’s lowering cost, improving efficiency and speed to market through global innovation—and yes—direct and indirect government support, have made it a viable energy supply provider to add to, or to some degree, challenge, fossil fuels. That sector has also had plenty of government support, as much as $35 billion annually, according to new data analysis by environmental advocate Oil Change International—based on tax breaks, lower rates to acquire land and other resources, direct appropriations and other financial support from the U.S. and government-funded groups.

Wind power now is the largest source of U.S. renewable energy, providing about 10% of total American energy capacity, the U.S. Energy Dept. said last year—and up to 26% in Texas, which leads the nation. State lawmakers failed to pass a bill this year to curtail wind power, hopefully enlightened by data showing prices would rise 14% if renewable energy growth was curbed.

With more lawsuits challenging Trump- ordered slaps to the wind sector that could prevail, the administration also wants to win in the court of public opinion. So the President leads his cabinet chiefs to derisively dismiss highly engineered wind energy systems as “windmills,” and assert wrongly that turbines kill whales and cause cancer.

Trump sued a decade ago to shut down an offshore wind system in Scotland, attempting to convince a court there that golfers who pay high fees at his nearby course spend more time gazing at spinning turbine blades than watching the trajectory of their golf balls.

He lost that legal battle, but the action hardly represents a leader who wants the U.S. to dominate the global AI race when his “all of the above” energy strategy needed to achieve that excludes renewable power. You can’t fix an “energy emergency” with a partial solution.

'Misguided Bid to Pick Winners and Losers'

China will be a tough competitor in the race to power AI—having invested alot in offshore wind energy for years, with the government enabling expansive projects and the world’s most powerful turbines—and now seeking growth in non-Chinese markets. It also has expanded and modernized coal and gas power plants, but fossil fuel output still has dropped 2% so far this year, compared to the same period last year, as wind and solar generation rose 16% and 43%, respectively, says research firm Ember.

The U.S. can compete, but not by the government “playing politics with new construction, in a misguided bid to pick winners and losers,” said a Washington Post editorial, or by risking much-needed investor confidence by revoking hard-won federal construction permits or shutting down projects.

None of this, not even basic notions of fair play, seems to matter if the U.S. executive branch now devotes itself to shaping every aspect of business life and markets and reserves the right to destroy what it doesn’t like. Now that the Trump administration has renamed the U.S. Dept. of Defense as the Dept. of War, it may as well christen a new cabinet-level department—the Dept. of Business Prevention.

Trump has sold America on his image as a successful builder. So he should know to let experts in the energy construction business fulfill their contracts so their investors have confidence their money won't be lost. He should also let the construction sector workforce now designing and building clearly needed systems continue do their jobs, see careers in their work and motivate the next generation to tackle the important mission ahead.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/09/09/ORSTEDORS-SOV-Wind-of-hopeORSTED-Sep2023_H219374-1600px.jpg?height=635&t=1757460890&width=1200,N,,2025-09-10 17:00:51.433743

Pilot Co., General Motors and EVgo Inc. have opened more than 200 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and 850 fast charging stalls across almost 40 states in the past two years.

Some of the newest states to join this growing network include Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, with significant expansion across Texas, Missouri and Florida.

Pilot Co. is No. 16on CSP’s 2025 Top 202 ranking of U.S. c-store chains by store count.

EV charging company EVgo offers 350-killowatt fast-chargers at the sites.

Plug and Charge, a feature that enables compatible EV models to automatically initiate and pay for a charging session simply by plugging in, is available throughout the network for drivers with compatible EV models.

Pull-through stalls allow drivers who are towing a trailer or traveling in an electric van to connect their charging ports. At the chargers, there are overhead canopies.

Knoxville, Tennessee-based Pilot and Flying J locations feature free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurants and grocery and convenience items.

“Pilot is here to fuel the journeys of all drivers,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot. “Our fast-charging network raises the bar for convenience, reliability and exceptional service by offering an experience designed to show EV drivers that they matter. Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel.”

Pilot, GM, based in Detroit, and EVgo, based in El Segundo, California, first announced their collaboration in 2022 and are now nearly halfway toward their goal of building a total of up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J locations across the United States. By the end of 2025, the companies anticipate reaching 1,000 stalls across 40 states.

Founded in 1958, Pilot is a wholly owned subsidiary of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and employs approximately 30,000 team members. It has more than 900 locations in 44 states and five Canadian provinces, serving an average of 1.2 million customers per day.

The American solar industry is gaining traction not just as a clean energy solution but as a steady source of job creation. With more than 279,000 people employed across solar-related roles in the United States, the sector has earned its place as one of the country’s fastest-growing workforces. From panel installation and equipment logistics to design, permitting and customer care, solar companies now offer a diverse range of opportunities. Freedom Forever, a residential solar provider with operations across more than two dozen states, has been among those helping drive this growth by creating accessible job paths in local communities and investing in workforce training.

Entry-Level Jobs with Long-Term Potential

Solar’s rise can be attributed to more than just clean energy incentives. It’s also about the work. Entry-level positions in the solar field often come with on-the-job training, competitive pay and the potential to move into leadership roles. For people transitioning from other industries or seeking an alternative to college debt, solar jobs offer a viable way to build a stable career.

Technicians, for example, begin with safety basics and installation practices. From there, many gain experience in wiring, permitting, battery integration or team coordination. These skills often serve as a foundation for future work in project management, training, or even business development. It supports these career paths by creating environments where growth is built into the job. The company emphasizes internal promotion, with employees often moving from field operations to supervisory roles within a few years.

Investing in Local Labor

The shift toward domestic manufacturing and renewable infrastructure has brought a wave of opportunity to areas historically tied to coal, oil or automotive production. It helps extend those benefits by hiring from within local communities and reducing the need for outside contractors.

In states like Texas, Ohio and Georgia, workers are finding that the skills they’ve already developed, electrical work, safety inspections, and mechanical troubleshooting, translate well to solar. These regions are now home to growing installation teams, support centers and distribution facilities that feed into the broader clean energy network. Rather than relocating for jobs, workers are finding new careers close to home. That kind of regional investment helps keep wages in local economies and strengthens household financial security.

Diverse Roles for a Changing Industry

The idea that solar jobs are limited to rooftops no longer holds. Today’s solar teams include professionals in logistics, accounting, IT, customer support and supply chain management. Growth in these areas has widened the talent pool and brought more people into clean energy careers.

It maintains a business structure that encourages cross-departmental collaboration, which lets employees explore different interests and apply their skills in new ways. A technician might move into system design, while a call center agent may develop a passion for operations. These shifts help maintain a flexible and motivated workforce. The company also supports workers who want to switch careers without starting over. With pathways open across departments, the company helps staff develop careers based on skill and performance, not just past credentials.

Bridging the Gap Between Vocational and Corporate

As solar businesses scale, they face common challenges, such as maintaining a connection between field-level experience and executive decision-making. The most effective companies are those that keep these worlds linked. It encourages leaders to stay connected to field operations and invites frontline feedback into business planning.

That input often leads to practical improvements in customer care, training or efficiency. At the same time, employees on the ground see that their input shapes the direction of the business. That connection builds loyalty and makes the organization stronger from the inside out.

Jobs That Reflect the Communities They Serve

The solar workforce is becoming more diverse, not only in skill but in background. Many companies are now partnering with veteran organizations, women-led trade programs and training centers in underserved areas to recruit talent. These efforts are helping more people build careers in solar regardless of their starting point.

Freedom Forever supports outreach programs that help introduce solar to groups historically underrepresented in the trades. That includes individuals returning from military service, those seeking second-chance employment, and students from schools that may not offer traditional STEM resources. As more of these workers rise into leadership roles, they bring lived experience that strengthens the industry’s ability to serve diverse customers and communities.

Training That Moves with the Market

In a sector that changes fast, professional development has become just as important as hiring. New technologies, grid standards and storage systems constantly shape the job. Workers need to stay up to date, and companies must offer the tools to help them do so.

It invests in continuing education by offering technical training and development modules through its internal learning platform. Staff are encouraged to earn certifications, attend workshops, and participate in leadership courses that match their interests and performance goals. That kind of ongoing support reduces turnover and helps teams adapt as the industry shifts.

A Job Today, a Career Tomorrow

Clean energy roles are about more than meeting demand. They’re about preparing for what’s next. With solar projected to supply more than 500 gigawatts of new capacity by 2035, employers need skilled, stable teams ready to take on the challenge. It views each hire as a long-term investment. The company supports job growth not just by expanding operations but by preparing workers to take on higher-level roles over time. From first-day installers to senior managers, team members are encouraged to see the job as more than a paycheck. With clear paths for advancement and a culture of mentorship, employees build careers they can take pride in.

Keeping Clean Energy Local

While national policy helps drive solar adoption, the real economic impact often plays out in local communities. When a solar system is installed, it supports workers at every stage, from the warehouse to the call center to the roof. It operates with a local-first approach. That means building branch teams close to customers, sourcing materials from U.S. manufacturers, and hiring people who live in the communities they serve. These decisions may reduce transportation costs and improve customer service, but they also create long-term local employment. For many towns facing industrial decline or economic transition, solar represents not just a new utility, but a new economic foundation.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*eDGlh8F6T0Vl0rUIOrst8Q.jpeg,N,,2025-09-10 18:01:26.778208

According to Nikkei, though Lexus and Toyota have yet to officially confirm the move, the report suggests Toyota's decision is a response to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on US imports. The new strategy will see Lexus focus on producing its high-selling hybrid vehicles at its remaining American plant in Indiana, while shifting other luxury models to Japan.

This change is not expected to affect Lexus’s operations in Canada, where the company currently manufactures the RX and NX SUVs. Lexus operates two plants in Japan - the Tahara plant in Aichi, which is five times the size of the soon-to-close Kentucky facility, produces models like the GX, IS, LS, and NX. The Motomachi site, also in Aichi, manufactures the LC, while the Kyushu facility in Fukuoka makes the UX, NX, ES, and RX.

Third facelift for its Japanese-built IS

This week, Lexus also unveiled a third facelift for its Japanese-built IS compact sedan, which first debuted in 2013, making it one of the oldest cars still on sale. The update features a sharper front design, new 19-inch alloy wheels, and a revised interior that removes the controversial touchpad controller and CD player.

Unfortunately for Kentucky, it will lose out, and Lexus production will cease, though Toyota will continue to manufacture other vehicles there. The next-generation Lexus ES, which was unveiled a few months ago and is expected to arrive in showrooms early next year, will reportedly be produced in Japan.

A new electric power steering system and updated dampers are expected to enhance handling, though the powertrain setup is likely to remain the same. If that’s the case, the IS 300h hybrid will feature a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing a modest 217 hp (162 kW / 220 PS), while the non-hybrid IS 350 will be equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 engine delivering 314 hp (214 kW / 318 PS). The latter, though less fuel-efficient, promises a more thrilling driving experience.

The US-built TX (shown below) sees a $500 price increase for 2026, starting at $57,090 for the 275 hp (279 PS) gasoline model. The four-cylinder hybrid option, offering 366 hp (371 PS), is available for an additional $2,300.

The tariff scenario

A recent ruling by the US Department of Commerce has extended steep tariffs to include steel and aluminium-containing products, which will have significant consequences for various industries, including automotive manufacturing. Under this rule, announced on August 19, 2025, 407 product categories were added to the existing tariff list, and imports with steel or aluminium content now face a 50 per cent duty. This move, aimed at protecting US manufacturers, is expected to drive up costs for electric-vehicle (EV) components, aftermarket exhaust systems, and other automotive parts reliant on steel and aluminium.

Lexus & aluminium

Lexus’s reliance on aluminium in its high-performance automotive components is another layer to consider in the context of the new tariffs. Aluminium is used in critical components such as engine parts, transmission elements, wheels, and suspension towers, where its strength, durability, and lightweight properties are crucial for performance. In addition, Lexus uses aluminium in components like aerodynamic wheels and even in the paint finish of its vehicles, where aluminium flakes enhance the aesthetic appeal.

As the cost of aluminium rises due to tariffs, Lexus, along with other automakers, will need to manage the impact on vehicle production costs. This could lead to higher prices for consumers, particularly in the premium vehicle market. Despite this, Lexus remains committed to using high-performance materials, ensuring that the vehicles remain competitive in terms of strength, luxury, and performance.

Toyota Motor’s Lexus brand incorporates high-performance aluminium alloys in various premium components of its vehicles, including engine parts, transmission elements, and wheels, to ensure superior strength, durability, and a luxurious appearance. Aluminium is also utilized in components such as suspension towers, aerodynamic wheels, and even in paint finishes, where aluminium flakes are used to create shimmering, depth-enhancing silver hues.

How will this tariff impact the EV industry?

With tariffs now targeting components like EV battery housings, motor parts, and structural elements that heavily rely on imported steel and aluminium, the cost of EVs is expected to rise. This could slow the adoption of electric vehicles, undermining efforts to reduce emissions and accelerate the clean-energy transition. The cost of aftermarket exhaust systems, which depend on imported steel, is also expected to increase, affecting the broader automotive aftermarket sector.

The tariffs are likely to create supply bottlenecks as manufacturers struggle with rising input costs and potential shortages of materials. For instance, aftermarket exhaust suppliers, which depend on steel imports, will face higher costs, potentially extending the lifecycle of older vehicles rather than encouraging the renewal of fleets with more fuel-efficient models. This could complicate the US administration’s broader sustainability and emissions reduction goals.",https://www.alcircle.com/api/media/1757525980.13549_toyota_image_0_0.png,N,,2025-09-10 16:01:57.949830

Community Lighthouse Strategy Expands Resilience

In 2022, Together Louisiana and the Greater New Orleans Foundation launched the Community Lighthouse strategy, with additional partnership from the LSU School of Social Work, to create a community-wide network of nonprofit resilience hubs, each powered by commercial-scale solar systems with back-up battery capacity, that will be able to better provide assistance to surrounding communities during power outages caused by hurricanes and other disasters. The Greater New Orleans Foundation provided a $1 million grant to The Community Lighthouse strategy, serving as the lead investor and partner in getting the project off the ground. The gift was the Foundation’s largest single grant from its Disaster Response and Restoration fund.

The funding from the Gulf Futures Challenge will allow the Community Lighthouse Initiative to expand to 80 resilience hubs, equipping trusted civic institutions with solar + battery microgrids and trained neighbors to provide reliable power, critical services, and strong neighborhood networks—strengthening energy resilience across the Gulf Coast.

“The Gulf Futures Challenge finalists exemplify the bold thinking and community-rooted innovation needed to navigate the complex transitions facing our environment, economy, and public health,” said Lauren Alexander Augustine, Ph.D., executive director of the Gulf Research Program. “We are proud to support their efforts and see them continue to build their ideas into action.”

“The Greater New Orleans Foundation is proud to partner with Together Louisiana on the Community Lighthouses project and to be recognized as one of ten finalists for the Gulf Futures Challenge by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Gulf Research Program and Lever for Change for that important work,” said Andy Kopplin, President and CEO of the Greater New Orleans Foundation. “As we saw with Hurricane Francine in September 2024, Community Lighthouses make a huge difference in the lives of members of our community. Following Hurricane Ida in August 2021, we received enough support from generous donors to make our largest ever long-term recovery investment to launch the Community Lighthouse project. An initiative of Together Louisiana, 18 Community Lighthouses have been established at congregations, clinics and community institutions statewide. When the power goes off, our most vulnerable citizens now have a place to go to access cooling stations, charging stations, food and water, oxygen exchange and other critical services.”

“The clock is ticking on the Gulf Coast. Disasters have shown us time and again that resilience must be built from the ground up, rooted in and accountable to our communities,” said Sonya Norsworthy, President of Together New Orleans, part of the Together Louisiana network. “This recognition affirms that the Community Lighthouse strategy is a model not only for our community, but for the entire Gulf Coast and beyond.”

The Gulf Futures Challenge

The ten finalist projects, drawn from across all five Gulf Coast states, are a collection of bold ideas that apply, translate, and communicate science, engineering, and medical knowledge to address critical challenges in the Gulf Coast region.

Representing all five Gulf states, these ten projects present creative visions for tackling the urgent challenges of energy security, environmental change, and community well-being, each through a distinct, locally grounded approach. The projects are united by a common goal of creating safer and more resilient communities where people in the Gulf can live, work, and thrive. From addressing flooding to repurposing decommissioned wind turbines, together, they are demonstrating how science can drive practical, people-centered solutions to today’s most pressing challenges.

The Gulf Futures Challenge received 164 applications from organizations based in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Each entry was subject to participatory reviews and multiple rigorous evaluations by experts from science, engineering, and medicine. The finalists collectively represent all five states along the Gulf Coast and were selected based on four key criteria: whether they were impactful, bridging knowledge to action, innovative, and inclusive in their proposed approaches.

Each of the ten finalist teams will receive an initial project development grant of $300,000 and technical assistance to strengthen their proposals. After submitting revised applications, two finalists will be awarded $20 million each to implement their solutions. The remaining eight will be eligible for up to $875,000 in additional project development support.

National charging network expands rapidly

A collaboration between Pilot Company, General Motors and EVgo has added significant momentum to the nation’s electric vehicle charging network, with more than 200 travel centers now offering fast charging. The expansion provides drivers with approximately 850 stalls spread across nearly 40 states, delivering critical infrastructure for long-distance EV travel.

The partners launched their initiative in 2022 and are already nearly halfway to their goal of building up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at 500 Pilot and Flying J travel centers nationwide. By the end of 2025, the group projects it will reach 1,000 stalls across 40 states.

Filling gaps along key travel routes

The rapid buildout has prioritized interstate corridors that carry more than one-fifth of U.S. traffic, helping to address one of the largest obstacles to EV adoption: charging availability on long trips. The companies note that at the start of 2025, fewer than half of U.S. rural counties had even a single fast charging stall.

In the past year alone, the network has grown from serving just over 25 states to nearly 40, adding coverage in Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Texas, Missouri and Florida have also seen significant expansion.

Improving the driver experience

The charging stations are located at Pilot and Flying J travel centers, providing EV drivers access to free Wi-Fi, on-site dining, and other amenities while they charge. Many sites feature overhead canopies and pull-through stalls designed for vehicles towing trailers.

Each stall uses EVgo’s 350kW fast chargers, capable of delivering a rapid recharge, and most support Plug and Charge technology. This allows compatible EVs to automatically initiate and pay for a session simply by connecting the charger, eliminating the need for additional steps.

“Charging access should never get in the way of an EV journey,” said Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy. “This collaboration ensures that drivers can confidently travel anywhere, anytime.”

California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator.","California is once again at the center of the nation’s automotive and energy policy debate. With federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits set to expire this September, the state is considering whether to create its own replacement program. This would not only affect car buyers but could also reshape the national conversation on emissions rules, vehicle affordability, and the balance of power between state and federal regulators.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a report on August 19 recommending that the state consider “backfilling” the federal credits with its own point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other incentives to keep EV sales moving. The details remain vague, but the intention is clear: California wants to keep its aggressive zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) goals on track, even as Washington scales back related programs.

But California has been here before. This is not the first time the state has clashed with the federal government over vehicle regulations – and it likely won’t be the last.

California has a unique history when it comes to vehicle emissions. Decades before the federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), California was already regulating air quality in response to its smog problem. When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, California was granted a waiver that allowed it to set its own, stricter emissions standards. Other states were given the option to adopt California’s rules, and some states have done so. Today, eleven states follows California’s lead. This waiver authority has made California an outsized force in shaping vehicle propulsion. Automakers cannot ignore a market of this size, which means California’s rules often become de facto national standards.

Clashes with Washington

California’s regulatory independence has not always sat well with Washington. Under different administrations, the federal government has either supported or resisted the state’s authority. During the Obama years, California partnered with the federal government to create a unified fuel economy and emissions program, giving automakers a single set of national rules. Under the Trump administration, the EPA rolled back certain emissions standards, sparking legal battles with California, which insisted on enforcing its own tougher rules. The state formed alliances with other states and even some automakers to defend its position. Today, with federal EV tax credits expiring at the end of September and policy focus shifting, California is again stepping into the driver’s seat by proposing its own financial incentives. These ongoing disputes highlight a deeper question: should environmental and automotive policy be driven by national uniformity, or by one state acting as the policy leader?

California’s ZEV mandate

The discussion over tax credits cannot be separated from California’s ZEV mandate. Under CARB’s plan, automakers must steadily increase the percentage of EVs they sell, with the ultimate goal of phasing out new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035. This is one of the most ambitious policies in the country, and automakers are scrambling to meet the targets. Some states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have pledged to follow California’s lead, while others remain skeptical. For consumers, this means that vehicle availability will increasingly be shaped by government mandates and not by market demand. Even if gas-powered cars remain popular, automakers will need to balance that demand with regulatory compliance.

California’s new incentives

The CARB report suggests that any new program would differ from the federal credits in key ways. Instead of tax credits, buyers could receive point-of-sale rebates, allowing them to benefit immediately rather than waiting until tax season. Incentives may vary depending on income level, vehicle type, or price, so luxury EVs could receive lower rebates while affordable models get more support. Additionally, any new program would be tied to yearly funding availability, meaning that if budgets tighten, rebates could shrink or disappear. This approach could make the system more flexible, but it also introduces uncertainty for buyers trying to plan their purchases. In the past the state of California and other states have run out of money in the EV fund and left buyers with nothing.

For California residents, the promise of continued incentives is welcome news, but the reality is more complicated. EVs still come with challenges beyond sticker price. Even with rebates, EVs are often thousands of dollars more expensive than comparable gasoline cars. California has built more chargers than any other state, yet many regions remain underserved, and home charging is not always an option, particularly for renters. EVs also tend to depreciate faster than gas vehicles due to rapid advances in technology and concerns about battery life. Insurance rates are higher on electric vehicles as well. A large expense is electricity rates which are going up across the country. Without a state-supported used EV credit, buyers in this segment may face steeper hurdles. Incentives may help address some of these issues in the short term, but they do not solve the bigger structural challenges of EV adoption.

One of the key criticisms of EV subsidies is that they often benefit wealthier households. Data from federal programs has shown that a large percentage of credits went to buyers in higher income brackets because these households are more likely to purchase new cars, and EVs remain disproportionately concentrated in the premium market segment. California may attempt to address this with scaled incentives, but questions remain about whether the system can truly deliver benefits to everyone. Meanwhile, working-class families who rely on affordable used cars may find themselves subsidizing programs that they cannot realistically take advantage of.

Automakers and the industry impact

For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight. The state accounts for nearly 12% of U.S. auto sales, and when you include the other states that follow its rules, the market share becomes impossible to ignore. Manufacturers that fail to meet California’s requirements face penalties, while those that comply can earn credits to sell or trade. This system has created an uneven playing field, favoring companies with strong EV lineups. Tesla, for instance, has profited significantly from selling ZEV credits to competitors in the past. If California establishes a robust new rebate system, it could further tilt the market toward EVs, encouraging automakers to prioritize them even more, take greater loses on each vehicle.

At its core, this debate is about whether government policy should drive technology adoption or whether the market should dictate the pace. California argues that aggressive incentives and mandates are necessary to address climate goals and push the auto industry forward. Critics counter that these policies distort the market, forcing automakers and taxpayers to shoulder costs that may not align with consumer demand. They also warn of unintended consequences, such as reduced affordability, lack of charging stations, and strained electrical infrastructure.

California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator. With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt – whether they’re ready or not. For some wealthier car buyers, this could mean continued financial support when purchasing an EV, but it also raises questions about long-term effectiveness. For taxpayers, it means another debate about where funds should be directed and increased taxes for residents. For the auto industry, it underscores more losses on vehicles that are designed by one state’s demands.

As history shows, when California moves, the rest of the country often feels the impact. The next few months will reveal whether the state can successfully design a program that keeps EV sales going without overburdening its citizens with more increased taxes. But one thing is certain: decisions made by California will burden at least 11 other states and this is a real issue to watch.

These are among the findings of a mid-year market analysis by Crux, a platform with marketplaces for both tax credit transfers and other clean energy finance products.
This comes amid a shift in policy in the U.S., as the Trump administration and GOP-led Congress shakes up the tax credit landscape.
The rise of energy storage transfers, for instance, isn’t a result of the sector’s tax credits being spared in the OBBB negotiations this summer.
So far, the majority of tax equity investments, 60%, have been hybrid deals; these are structured to transfer just a portion of tax credits.","The market for clean energy tax credits more than doubled in size in 12 months, from $8.5 billion in the first half of 2024 to more than $20 billion in the first half of this year. This growth is driven in part by diversification: More investors are buying tax credits for more types of technologies.

These are among the findings of a mid-year market analysis by Crux, a platform with marketplaces for both tax credit transfers and other clean energy finance products. The report, out this week, outlines a shift in market composition underway — one that is more a reflection of the pre-Trump implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act than it is of the present policy landscape of 2025. Credits for advanced manufacturing, nuclear, hydropower, geothermal, and especially energy storage are ascendant; together, these newly eligible tax credits made up about 36% of transfers, up about 50% compared with a year ago.

Combined, solar-plus-storage and standalone storage deals made up 26% of the transactions in the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, wind credits make up a shrinking portion of the market. (Solar is also technically shrinking as a share of the market, but only because the market is growing so rapidly; the number and size of those transactions are holding roughly steady.)

However, credits for the more mature technologies are getting more favorable terms; Crux found that investment-grade sellers saw higher prices on tax transfers, while the rest of the market saw prices drop in the first half of the year: Investment-grade sellers averaged 94 cents per dollar, while non-investment grade sellers averaged 91 cents. Those pushing credits for newer technologies or less experienced developers saw higher costs of capital this year, as well as less access to financing.

This comes amid a shift in policy in the U.S., as the Trump administration and GOP-led Congress shakes up the tax credit landscape. The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, preserved the ability to transfer clean energy tax credits, but it complicated the market by adding regulatory hurdles like the new “foreign entity of concern” rules. And because the law sunsetted key wind and solar credits earlier than anticipated, experts expect that the makeup of the transferability will continue to shift — especially as the 45X advanced manufacturing credit gets more use.

Though the report itself only covers the first half of 2025, through June, Crux CEO Alfred Johnson said he has observed “a slowdown in buyer activity in July and August that was definitely correlated with buyers understanding and adjusting to a new tax liability.”

And other provisions of the OBBB means that corporate tax liability will be lower overall this year, by as much as 20% to 30%. This is “weighing heavily on buyer demand” at the moment, according to Crux, and causing prices of these transactions to drop. However, Crux expects demand for these transactions to surge again toward the end of 2025.

That said, this report on the first half of the year does not necessarily reflect the response to the Trump administration. As Johnson put it, the transfer market is like light years, where “the light that you see comes from a prior time.” The report’s findings are “reflective of dynamics in project finance that happened over the last few years, because it takes a long time to build projects,” Johnson said.

The rise of energy storage transfers, for instance, isn’t a result of the sector’s tax credits being spared in the OBBB negotiations this summer. Rather, he added, “storage received tax credits for the first time in the IRA and that contributed to a significant volume of storage that was planned and deployed over that period,” and is being realized this year. There have also been technological improvements and more demand due to load growth.

Similarly, the rise of nuclear deals is in part due to far more “very large” transactions of over $300 million than in previous years, Crux found. These are largely thanks to the update to the nuclear production tax credit under the IRA, which took effect at the beginning of 2024 — and not necessarily to the rising demand for nuclear as a result of load growth in 2025 and the latter half of 2024. (That said, as nuclear capacity prices rise like they are already doing in the PJM Interconnection, it’s likely the U.S. will see fewer tax credits; the credits are typically available only when power market revenue is below a certain threshold.)

In the second half of the year, Crux expects the market size to jump further, to between $55 billion and $60 billion total for 2025. This estimated increase is in part due to the seasonal nature of the market; most credits tend to be bought and sold in the second half of the year as companies rush to complete projects within the tax year.

So far, the majority of tax equity investments, 60%, have been hybrid deals; these are structured to transfer just a portion of tax credits. Transferring credits out of tax equity is the market’s fastest-growing segment, expected to reach between $11 billion and $13 billion for the year. This is up from $7 billion in 2024.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-10T133400.551.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 15:01:02.223422

TRANSCRIPT

The Public News Service Newscast, September the 10th, 2025.

I'm Mike Clifford.

The Supreme Court Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.

That is the take from CBS News.

They report the high court agreed to review lower court decisions and found Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law.

The Trump administration has argued upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the U.S. at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.

CBS notes the case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Trump's second term policies.

And researchers and students at the University of Nebraska are addressing a critical shortage of early childhood educators, especially in rural parts of the state.

The program, called CAHNU, is designed to increase recruitment and retention of rural early child care workers and teachers.

Holly Hatton, associate professor in child, youth and family studies at the University of Nebraska, says the program asks communities what they need most and puts that information to use in educating future providers, employers and community leaders.

In terms of their professional learning, workforce development, and really using this community-led approach to support rural communities in unique ways so that we can have a sustainable approach to support having access for families and communities to have provision of quality childcare.

Researchers are gathering information from local communities on a regular basis to help build the program, including at a conference in Kearney this weekend.

The Canoe Program is funded by a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education.

I'm Mark Moran.

And a special program with New Hampshire's Laconia School District is helping students who leave high school without a degree find success.

The transition program goes beyond academics to teach students the life skills they'll need to live independently, hold a job, or navigate local services.

Interim Director of Special Education, Jen Sautak, says the feedback from students' families tells her it's working.

Their response to that has just been like, holy moly, this is amazing. and it allows them to think bigger for their own kids.

New Hampshire expanded the definition of a child with a disability in 2022 to include all people younger than 22 identified as needing special education services.

Sautak says students benefit when educators are given the flexibility to create programs that cater to their students' strengths.

This story was produced with original reporting from Adam Dropchow for Laconia Daily Suns.

An important component of the transition program is the many field trips to locations students will visit as adults, including local banks, fire and police stations, medical clinics, or community service centers.

I'm Catherine Carley.

A Minnesota court settlement is prompting the state to take another look at what's considered a hidden threat to water supplies and issue excess nitrate runoff from farm fields.

This month's agreement stems from a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a handful of environmental and conservation groups.

They called into question the effectiveness of existing rules covering farm practices like manure and commercial fertilizer application.

The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy's Carly Griffiths says when those common farming practices aren't followed with enough safeguards, the drinking water in surrounding communities is vulnerable to pollution.

There are really often higher burdens of health impacts on rural private well users that aren't on a municipal public water supply system.

The agreement gives the state agriculture department a year to analyze its groundwater protection rule along with public input.

There's a similar order for the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on a rule dealing with feedlot operations with its review process already underway.

I'm Mike Moen.

Next to Indiana where lawmakers say they're preparing for more oversight of artificial intelligence.

The state's artificial intelligence task force voted Tuesday to recommend creating a permanent commission to study the fast-growing technology.

Republican State Senator Liz Brown, who co-chairs the task force, says the recommendation is designed to keep lawmakers engaged year-round.

The goal would be that we establish this permanent commission to meet on a more regular basis so we don't cram all these really big topics in a short period of time and then wait a whole 'nother nine months to meet again.

Brown stresses AI will impact every part of daily life.

Supporters say a standing commission will help lawmakers balance opportunity with consumer protection.

They warn that if Indiana waits too long, technology could advance faster than regulations.

I'm Joe Ulari, Public News Service.

Finally, while climate change is already known for its link to the spread of infectious disease and heightened symptoms for people with respiratory and cardiovascular illness, it's also connected to stress, trauma, and poor mental health.

A 2018 Indiana Climate Change Assessment Report says the state has warmed slightly more than one degree Fahrenheit per year since 1895, with a future projected rise of five to six degrees every year by 2050.

Climate Emergency Fund Director and clinical psychologist Margaret Klein-Salomon says our society is living in an unprecedented situation with climate change, which can produce an immense range of emotions.

We feel fear, anger, grief, guilt.

That's actually not the problem.

The problem is we don't know what to do with that.

People are repressing them and denying them and saying it must be fine, I'm overreacting.

I'm Terry Dee reporting.

When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, it was the largest climate bill in U.S. history, with major incentives for electric vehicle production and adoption. In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How We Got Here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric Vehicles Are Cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An Opportunity For Cleaner Electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A Virtuous – Or Vicious – Cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors – power generation and transportation – while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2021/02/17092645/EV-electric-vehicle-chargers-Ala-Moana-Shopping-Center-v2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 15:01:18.653119

The company says the initiative, which does not yet have a date, marks the next step toward an energy system powered by cars as much as by power plants.

Earlier this year, the company announced a partnership with global EV giant BYD, releasing the ‘Power Pack Bundle’ for their home market in the UK. The bundle includes a leased V2G-ready BYD Dolphin, a bidirectional Zaptec Pro charger and access to a smart tariff that offers free home charging.

Those same innovations, says the company, will soon be making their way to Germany, where approximately 125,000 V2G-ready cars would be able to power the city of Munich for an hour.

Octopus’ plans were announced alongside the launch of the company’s EV leasing business in Germany, Octopus Electric Vehicles (Octopus EV), bringing over the company’s EV package from the UK.

Within the package, German drivers will be able to get an electric car, home charger, access to the Octopus’ roaming service, Octopus Electroverse, and a smart energy tariff.

Octopus’ Intelligent Octopus smart tariff enables drivers to save on expenses by automatically charging when energy is cheapest and greenest.

Since launching in 2018, Octopus EV has grown to become the UK’s leading fully EV leasing company, helping more than 35,000 UK drivers switch to electric.

Commenting in a release was Fiona Howarth, founder and director of Octopus Electric Vehicles: “Germany is a powerhouse in the automotive industry, and the home of some of our most-loved EV brands.

“With shared values around great technology and reliable, trusted service, we wanted our European debut to be in Germany.”

Octopus Energy first entered the German market in 2020, now claiming more than 800,000 customers.

However, there was no new upstream manufacturing investment in Q2 as federal policies threaten to stall U.S. solar manufacturing momentum.
Solar deployment is expected to be 4 percent lower than the pre-HR1 base case by 2030.
“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, said.
“The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1.","The U.S. solar industry installed nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity in the first half of 2025, accounting for 82 percent of all new power added to the grid in its first six months.

However, recent Trump administration actions targeting solar and the HR-1 legislation have significantly reduced deployment forecasts. The U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies put the United States at risk of losing 44 GW of solar deployment by 2030, an 18 percent decline.

When comparing this forecast to pre-HR1 forecasts, the United States is at risk of losing 55 GW of solar deployment by 2030, a 21 percent drop.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid. But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

The SEIA report found that 77 percent of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states won by President Trump. This included 8 of the top 10 states for new solar installations – Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas.

In the first half of 2025, the United States added 13 GW of new solar module manufacturing capacity with new or expanded factories in Texas, Indiana and Minnesota.

Currently, the U.S. has 55 GW of total solar module manufacturing capacity. However, there was no new upstream manufacturing investment in Q2 as federal policies threaten to stall U.S. solar manufacturing momentum. Solar deployment is expected to be 4 percent lower than the pre-HR1 base case by 2030.

However, near-term deployment is bolstered by projects already underway, a rush to meet tax credit deadlines, and rising demand for power as new gas generation becomes more expensive and less available.

The report also details how recent executive actions could damage the industry, including the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) order that singles out solar for more obstructive permitting treatment. This action is expected to impact roughly 44 GW of planned solar capacity, with Arizona, California, and Nevada most affected.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, said. “The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.”

If not reversed, these executive actions will result in lost jobs, increased electricity prices, and a less competitive economy, the report said.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/shutterstock_1888482466.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 15:01:39.185614

Porter Public Works Director James Spanier during Tuesday’s Town Council meeting noted the deal was “back from the dead.” He said that he recently received word from Drive Clean Indiana, a nonprofit, that Porter could order the vehicles in January.
The $4 million grant was awarded in May 2022, enabling municipalities in Porter and Lake counties to obtain electric trucks and charging stations.
That means Porter would have paid $66,000 for a fleet of six new electric pickup trucks.
He said under the grant, a charging station could be built that would be hooked up with Wi-Fi at a lower cost.","The town of Porter may finally be in line to receive promised federal grant money to help pay for electric-powered pickup trucks and charging stations, more than three years after the award was made.

But during the past three years, a number of conditions have changed that make Porter town officials wary about the deal.

Porter Public Works Director James Spanier during Tuesday’s Town Council meeting noted the deal was “back from the dead.” He said that he recently received word from Drive Clean Indiana, a nonprofit, that Porter could order the vehicles in January.

However, there has been a change in some of the grant’s terms.

The $4 million grant was awarded in May 2022, enabling municipalities in Porter and Lake counties to obtain electric trucks and charging stations. The original source of the federal dollars was the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which then-President Joe Biden signed on Nov. 5, 2021. One of the stated goals was to address climate change.

Distribution of the grant dollars was held up locally because a number of parties were involved. Spanier said the issue was settled by the State Board of Accounts, and each community can receive their allotment starting in January. Drive Clean Indiana is overseeing the process.

The federal grant would have originally paid 80% of the cost of a Ford Lightning F-150, priced at $55,000 in 2023. That means Porter would have paid $66,000 for a fleet of six new electric pickup trucks. The grant would also pay 80% of a charging station’s price, which is priced at $20,000.

But now, the grant requires the local community to pay for 36% of the cost. Costs for the Ford Lightning F-150s have also risen, Spanier said.

If Porter went forward with ordering six Ford Lightning F-150 trucks, the town would have to come up with $112,320, which is an estimated $18,720 per vehicle.

There are some limitations with the electric-powered trucks — snow shovels don’t work on them — that have caused Porter officials to pause.

Spanier said that if the town went forward, ordering three F-150 Lightning trucks would be more likely.

But then, there are other obstacles. Finances are expected to be tight for the next few years because of Senate Bill 1 passed this year, which limits the future growth of property tax revenue for local municipalities.

When purchasing the vehicles, the town would have to pay full price up front for the vehicles and be reimbursed.

Councilman James Burge, I-4th Ward, said that President Donald Trump’s administration is notably anti-electric vehicle, and there is a danger that money allocated for the grant could be suddenly withdrawn.

Council President Laura Madigan, D-1st Ward, and Town Clerk-Treasurer Corinne Peffers said there is a real concern that the town could purchase the vehicles and then not be reimbursed.

“I don’t know if I want to gamble with the taxpayer’s money,” Madigan said.”If this falls through, I would be sick about it.”

Madigan said “a sour taste has been left in my mouth from the last three years” of dealing with the grant.

Spanier said there is an alternative with the charging stations. He said under the grant, a charging station could be built that would be hooked up with Wi-Fi at a lower cost.

Council decided that it would delay any decision until they obtain more information.

In other business, the council unanimously approved a $30,000 contract with Commonwealth Engineers, Inc. to study the main sewer line issue on the north side of Porter.

Michael Barry, the town’s development director/building commissioner, said that the problem is infiltration of water from storm events into the old 18-inch clay sewer line that runs from Marquardt Street and up Waverly Road to serve older subdivisions north of U.S. 20.

If the clay pipe were relined, it would cut down on infiltration during storm events, which would save the town a significant amount of money.

Spanier said that the old sewer line that serves Porter’s downtown was relined years ago, and it significantly cut the sewer bill that the town has to pay Chesterton for treating sewage.

But once news of the proposal spread, what the family believed to be its private business became a heated, county-wide argument that ultimately killed the promise of solar in Walworth county.
At 3,200 acres, the Berens’ solar park would have covered just under half the family’s total farmland, including its least productive sections.
Last summer, researchers at Columbia University debunked some of the most pervasive misconceptions surrounding solar energy, including claims that solar development forever destroys farmland and that solar projects would be abandoned without government subsidies.
Although the Andrees insist their rejection of the solar project was driven by safety concerns, Colton can’t help feeling that it was politically motivated.","Like most of South Dakota, Walworth county is built on farming. To the east of Selby, the county seat, vast fields of soybeans and wheat grow between roads that run straight to the horizon. To the west, beyond the county line, the Standing Rock Indian Reservation spreads across miles of rumpled green prairie studded with creamy erratics and dark clumps of trees.

Like many farming regions, Walworth’s deeply conservative population has been steadily declining and aging, from roughly 8,000 in the 1960s to 5,200 today. The grain elevator that towers over Main Street in Selby is among the busiest in the region, but most of the squat brick buildings in its shadow are weathered and lifeless.

When the Good Samaritan Society announced it was pulling out of town in 2018, residents collected donations to keep the elder care center open. When Selby’s last grocery store shuttered in late 2023, the city became the center of a food desert that stretches 73 miles, from Ipswich to Mobridge. And in May, the area lost another high school due to lack of enrollment.

The most immediate economic challenge, however, is the jail. Selby must accommodate prisoners countywide, but its jail was condemned after inmates sued over unsafe conditions. Without the funds to replace it, Walworth spends more than $50,000 a month transporting and boarding prisoners at facilities as far as 70 miles away.

“Unless you’re a farmer, a hunter, or a fisher, there’s really nothing to do in this area,” said Colton Berens, a 33-year-old US army veteran and fourth-generation farmer. As a result, not many people his age stick around. However, when Doral Renewables, an Israeli-owned energy company, contacted his family in 2022 with a proposal to build a 3,200-acre solar array on the Berens’ property, Colton saw a chance for his family to benefit – as well as an opportunity to breathe life into his “dying” community.

The Berens’ solar project would have generated about $1m in annual tax revenue that would have been split between the county and its school for 35 years – money that could have gone a long way toward solving some of these challenges. During negotiations with his family over the use of its land, Berens said, Doral also agreed to upgrade the rugged gravel roads its crews would use during construction and to plant native grasses under the panels that could provide fodder for sheep.

“We made people aware of all that in a public meeting,” said Deb Kahl, Walworth county’s deputy auditor. But once news of the proposal spread, what the family believed to be its private business became a heated, county-wide argument that ultimately killed the promise of solar in Walworth county. In this, the Berenses were not alone.

Since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, Republican districts across the country have received about $200bn in clean energy investment. And yet many red communities have also joined a rising tide of resistance against the growth of clean energy, driven by ideological resentment for its inclusion in the liberal agenda. By the end of 2024, according to researchers at Columbia Law School, at least 459 counties and municipalities across 44 states had severely restricted renewable energy through things like buffer requirements, fees and bans that limit what their neighbors can do with their land. This is a 16% increase in such restrictions over the previous year.

South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission will not permit a project unless it follows local rules, and since Walworth did not have a local ordinance to regulate utility-scale solar when Doral arrived, the Berens’ project was delayed while county commissioners drafted a law to determine how and where an installation could be built. Dozens of farmers, teachers, fishing guides, moms and grandparents turned out to public hearings to voice their opinions. While some supported the project, a vocal opposition won out – complaining that such a large installation would visually mar the agrarian landscape and relying heavily on alarming misinformation and talking points spread by rightwing activists with roots in the oil and gas industry.

In late 2024, the county adopted an ordinance that requires solar panels be at least 1 mile from any occupied dwelling and 1,000 ft from a property line. These restrictions, which are stricter than the state’s regulations, not only quashed the Berens’ project, but stamped out almost any hope that utility-scale solar could bring this economically depressed community in the future.

The new law limits the county’s economic development prospects, Kahl said. “We’re probably not going to get anything except wind or solar” since Walworth doesn’t have enough employable residents to lure other industries with higher human resource needs.

For Colton, who feels that his family’s right to develop its own land was violated, it was a shattering blow. “It left a bad taste in my mouth for the whole area,” he said.

South Dakota is almost entirely covered in farms. Flat, open, connected by roads and linked to power grids, farmland makes a good place to site renewable energy. Wind, in particular, has muscled through the anti-renewables bias over the past decade and now accounts for more than half the state’s total energy production. It helps that wind is omnipresent on the plains and farmers can easily seed and harvest around a turbine’s small footprint. Also, the need to space windmills across a vast area requires developers to purchase leases from multiple landowners, securing local buy-in by spreading the economic benefits around. Solar, meanwhile, contributes a paltry 0.26% to the total energy generation, though not for lack of potential.

Three years ago, utility-scale solar was negligible in South Dakota. Then, new interest driven by falling prices and lucrative federal tax incentives like those in the Inflation Reduction Act, helped spur the addition of two solar parks, which bumped production to nearly 300MW, about enough to power 50,000 average US homes.

In 2023, however, just as the solar industry was getting rolling, then governor Kristi Noem chose not to take advantage of funding through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar For All program, which offered $7bn for solar projects in low-income communities. She also opted out of the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program, which would have given the state $3m toward reducing emissions after filling out a form less than a page long. Noem’s spokesperson called these Biden administration programs “wasteful spending” and “the single largest cause of the inflation crisis that our nation finds itself in”.

Now, as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Noem has joined an administration that is outwardly hostile toward clean energy. Trump has called renewables “stupid”, “ugly”, “inefficient”, “a disaster” and “a blight on our country”. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act won the votes of lawmakers in the hard-right Freedom caucus by promising to terminate “those Green New Scam subsidies”, Chip Roy, a Texas representative, told Politico, and the administration has set about doing just that.

But not all Republicans are on board with the gutting. Some, like John Curtis, a Utah senator, and Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska senator, called for Congress to maintain subsidies for renewable projects, noting that clean energy investment has most benefited red districts. Since Trump took office, red districts have lost more than $11bn in renewables investment and some 11,000 potential jobs, according to the environmental research group, E2.

In South Dakota, renewable energy provides $40m annually in property, state and local taxes, and employs about 6,800 people, according to the Clean Grid Alliance. South Dakota farmers also see nearly $30m a year in lease payments from renewable energy projects on their lands. Unlike most farm income, this doesn’t dry up under the sun or swing on the whims of agriculture markets.

Financially, compared with most crops, Berens said, “it’s a better use of the land. You have 35 years of a stable income, through drought, through famine, through everything.” This stability could prove especially valuable in the coming years, when experts predict climate crisis will cause South Dakota’s wheat and soybean markets to stagger.

At 3,200 acres, the Berens’ solar park would have covered just under half the family’s total farmland, including its least productive sections. But taking farmable acres out of production is a deeply contentious issue in rural America and an easy target for an administration bent on smothering renewables.

In May, Trump ordered the US Department of Agriculture to withhold federal funding for solar panels on productive farmland and asked state and local governments to do the same. “Those big solar fields, they’re taking our farmland. Our farmers are, like, mortified by it. They hate it,” he said later.

In Walworth, that message resonated with farmers like Steve Zabel, who grows mostly wheat and soybeans on 10,000 acres beside the Berens property. He and his brother have sons returning from college to work on the family farm, and to them, the spread of solar panels across agricultural land represents an existential crisis.

“Farming is what we got out here,” Zabel said of why he opposed the project. “A lot of these kids that grew up in these areas, if they don’t have farms to come back to, they don’t come back.”

He also worried about how solar panels might affect his crops. “We didn’t know if it was gonna bring more rain or deter the rain from getting here, or bring in hail storms,” he said. “You get that size of acreage of glass panels – we were concerned it could just change the atmosphere.”

Fears that solar will overtake farmland and cause changes to the weather have been grossly exaggerated in misinformation spread by organizations like No to Solar and Citizens for Responsible Solar, an activist group started by a longtime political operative with ties to high-level conservative politicians and the fossil fuel industry. They have helped disseminate a smorgasbord of unfounded claims, many of which found fertile ground in the anxieties of Walworth’s residents.

The solar project would have run nearly seven linear miles across tracts owned by the Berenses, with breaks for wildlife and views, terminating on a south-facing slope across a dirt road from the New Evarts Resort. The resort offers guided river and ice fishing, a bait shop, RV hookups, and a steakhouse with a full bar beside the Missouri River. Tucked behind its tourist attractions is a secluded road with river views and about 50 homes that constitute one of the wealthiest communities in the county. Near the end of the road is the home of Bud and Jennifer Andree.

When the Andrees make the 20-mile drive to Selby, Jennifer stops by the county courthouse to check up on her neighbors. “I like to keep apprised of what’s coming into the county,” she said. In January 2023, she was perusing files in the records office when she saw that a green energy company had applied for leases on the Berens’ land. At the time she didn’t know it was Doral, the company building Mammoth Solar, a project in Indiana that began as a 300MW installation and grew into the largest solar park in the country, at 1.3GW.

“We did not want that here,” she said, switching off a TV broadcasting Fox News in a living room filled with Bibles, gospel companion books and porcelain figurines of Christ.

The Andrees moved to Walworth in 2021, seeking a place where Jennifer could escape the “horrific and disabling symptoms” she said she has experienced since being exposed to microwave radiation while living in New Mexico.

“It was the smart meters” that caused it, she said, referring to devices that measure a home’s energy consumption and transmit the data to utility companies over a wireless network. Jennifer says her exposure resulted in electromagnetic hypersensitivity, a nonspecific condition with no medically proven cause, and she has joined state and national petitions to stop the use of smart meters, which, she says, “made me extremely ill”.

Today, she claims that anything with an electrical current causes her headaches, brain fog and pain. From across her living room, my idle cellphone “burns” her legs, forcing her to leave the room. Across the road from her resort community, the prospect of a solar park threatened the peace she had found in one of the most rural places in America. So she took up the fight to stop it.

“It was never anything personal against the [Berenses],” she said. “I was fighting for my home and for my life.”

The Andrees joined the Concerned Citizens of Walworth County, formed to stop the Doral project by spreading word of the dangers posed by solar installations. The group’s Facebook page featured an image, popular among anti-solar groups, of a solar park ravaged by a storm. (It did not mention that the facility was in Puerto Rico or that the storm had been Hurricane Maria.)

In an op-ed titled The Dark Side of Solar, published across two installments in a local newspaper, Jennifer asserted that solar power comes up short on its economic promises, leaves communities with expensive bills for cleanup, damages roads, degrades lands, causes birds to burst into flames, creates a hazardous glare for passing drivers, produces electromagnetic fields, emits “dirty electricity” and radio interference, displaces wildlife and raises the ambient temperature.

Her two most dire risks were hail and fire. The plains see punishing storms, and since the project would sit near the banks of the Missouri upstream of an intake for the county water supply, Jennifer warned that damage to the panels from extreme weather would cause “heavy metal toxins such as lead, and carcinogenic cadmium” to leach into the soil and waterways. And if a fire started, she threatened, a chain reaction could set the whole installment ablaze in an inferno that Walworth’s volunteer firefighters weren’t equipped to handle.

Last summer, researchers at Columbia University debunked some of the most pervasive misconceptions surrounding solar energy, including claims that solar development forever destroys farmland and that solar projects would be abandoned without government subsidies. They also found that what cadmium is present in solar panels exists as cadmium telluride, “which is non-volatile, non-soluble in water, and has 1/100th the toxicity of free cadmium”. And, despite fears that a solar installment emits harmful electromagnetic fields, the largest source of EMFs on a solar park, the inverters, were found to emit up to 1,050 milligauss – less than a can opener.

But at community meetings organized by the Concerned Citizens, these unfounded fears took center stage.

“It was a lot of worst-case scenario stuff,” said Jerry Stiegelmeier, a retired farmer in Selby who attended a meeting. There were images of shattered PV panels, admonitions of plummeting land values and an unnamed woman who shared a harrowing story of living next to a solar park in Indiana that caught fire repeatedly, leaving her children anemic and the farmland condemned. “This whole thing would be an economic boon for the county, and they were not considering that,” he said. “They were just fearmongering.”

Stiegelmeier, who rents 2,500 acres to other growers, voiced his own fear that without an injection of revenue like the solar park was offering, Walworth would have to raise property taxes on landowners like him and he would have no choice but to increase rents for his tenant farmers.

Meanwhile, Berens did his own research. He spoke with farmers who leased to Doral in other states. He explored the toxic makeup of PV panels and the likelihood that they would leach into a water supply he shares. He confirmed that Doral would maintain a salvage fund to cover the cost of cleanup in the event of damage and that it would train and equip local firefighters to handle a hazmat fire. He offered to plant trees that would hide the panels from view, and he had the company agree to repairing the roads its crews would use during construction.

Through increasingly vitriolic debates, the commissioners searched for ways to address concerns without creating a law that would ban much needed economic development. One of them, Kevin Holgard, drove four hours to visit the state’s largest active installation, Wild Springs Solar, near Rapid City, to see for himself about the noise and heat it produces. In the end, he was the only commissioner to vote against the ordinance.

“We’ve done all we could to stop all the fires. We took all the batteries out. We took the cadmium out. We tried to take everything out that all the concern was out there about,” Holgard said before the vote in September of 2024. “We might as well just say we don’t want any more businesses coming into Walworth county.”

On the day the vote was held, the Berenses said almost nothing. “We just decided we weren’t going to win,” said Jason Berens, Colton’s father. “We didn’t have any rights as landowners.”

South Dakota has a complex history with land rights, said Chase Jenson, an organizer with Dakota Rural Action, a nonprofit that promotes “healthy … and just food, agriculture, and energy systems”. Corporations looking to install energy pipelines or other development often use a county’s bad roads or closing schools as leverage to push through what, to some, looks like a land grab, he said. In response, many here are wary of their state being a “sacrifice zone” for outside ambitions. And part of the resulting ethos is the reliance on county ordinances, which provide local control.

Increasingly, however, Berens’ sentiment is being shared by farmers in similar conflicts across the country. In Ohio, nine landowners, including large soybean growers, weathered blistering misinformation aimed at keeping them from leasing their land to a solar company in a state where a landowner’s right to extract oil and gas is better protected than their right to generate solar power. In Iowa, concentrated animal feeding operations, which pose well-documented problems for local air and water resources, are approved more often than solar parks. Texas recently passed a bill with permit restrictions exclusive to wind and solar projects. And Michigan lawmakers are making it easier for local governments to forbid solar on private land.

When it comes to planning for renewables in rural areas, what’s lamentable “is that a lot of these conversations are reactionary”, said Sarah Mills, an associate professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Michigan. Farming communities are accustomed to fighting the creep of suburban sprawl and often don’t have the information needed to predict how solar energy will impact grain sales or make up for losses due to decreasing future demand for ethanol, for instance. It’s only after a proposal forces the issue that officials and residents must confront this new and complex question, she said.

It doesn’t help that companies like Doral have more expertise than residents, government leaders and community associations. When Mills asked rural residents through a survey who they trusted for information about renewable projects, “government is low on a list, but not as low as developers”, she said. Amid the information vacuum, locals turned to Facebook, where misinformation runs rampant.

The concerned citizens of Walworth demanded that the commissioners have no contact with Doral while drafting their ordinance. And when Jennifer felt that the county was being too deferential to the company, she threatened to report it to the American Civil Liberties Union for not accommodating her disability. Although the Andrees insist their rejection of the solar project was driven by safety concerns, Colton can’t help feeling that it was politically motivated. The scope of restrictions they advocated for – effectively banning utility-scale solar anywhere in the county – suggests that siting near their resort home wasn’t the only issue, he said.

But Bud said he “couldn’t care less about solar” as long as it goes somewhere else. “Don’t sit there and say we’re trying to hinder or stymie the project because we don’t like solar,” he said. “People will say that it’s the way of the future, even though it’s not, OK. It’s one of the most inefficient energy sources – with the exception of, yeah, you get free energy from the sun – but all the things that it does as an unintended result are not worth it.”

Jennifer maintains that she fought for her health, but also admits that she doesn’t buy into solar as the future of energy, noting that, “Our president calls it the ‘Green New Scam.’”

As it happens, Doral pulled out of the project before the county voted on its ordinance, but the commissioners adopted the restrictions anyway. The company is now building a 1,000MW facility elsewhere in South Dakota and Walworth is still looking for the funds to build its jail.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5403ae4c0bc7d8b174d8092c18f0013782e4347e/821_422_4474_3578/master/4474.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75097514da04a81daafa0e44df99601b",N,,2025-09-10 14:01:52.658850

Abu Dhabi (UAE) - Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are gaining strategic importance worldwide for the energy transition. They enable the flexible balancing of fluctuating renewable energy generation and play a key role in decarbonizing power systems and ensuring energy security. The market is evolving dynamically - both technologically and economically.

BESS facilitate the temporal shifting of electricity from solar and wind power plants - a function that has become the main application globally. At the same time, technological progress and economies of scale are significantly driving down project costs. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) highlights current developments in the BESS sector in the latest episode of its podcast “All Things Renewable.”

Energy Shifting Emerges as the Leading Application

Battery energy storage systems are essential for integrating renewable energy into power systems. In particular, so-called energy shifting - the temporal shifting of electricity generation and consumption - has established itself as the leading use case for storage.

This application has been dominant since 2018. In 2024, according to IRENA, around 67% of newly installed BESS capacity worldwide was dedicated to energy shifting. Excess energy - such as that generated by solar PV during peak sunlight or wind turbines during high wind conditions - is stored and fed back into the grid during periods of high demand. This improves system flexibility and increases the share of renewables in the power mix.

BESS are deployed in two main configurations: grid-connected utility-scale systems and behind-the-meter systems located near consumers. The former are connected to distribution or transmission grids, or directly to generation facilities, and are used for services such as frequency regulation and energy shifting. The latter are installed at private, commercial, or industrial sites - often in combination with rooftop solar - and are primarily used for reducing electricity costs, load management, and backup power.

Cost Reductions and Technology Transformation Boost Competitiveness

One of the main drivers of global BESS deployment is the dramatic reduction in costs. Between 2010 and 2024, total costs of fully installed battery storage projects dropped by 93%, from USD 2,571 to USD 192 per kilowatt-hour, according to IRENA. Between 2023 and 2024 alone, costs fell by 38% for two-hour systems and 32% for four-hour systems, significantly improving their economic viability and market appeal.

At the same time, lithium-ion technology has emerged as the leading form of storage, dominating both utility-scale and consumer-level applications - thanks to its high efficiency, long lifespan, and deep discharge capability.

Within this technology class, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry has seen particularly strong growth. Its market share rose from 48% in 2021 to an estimated 85% in 2024. Key reasons include lower costs, longer lifespan, and improved safety compared to other lithium-ion chemistries.

There are also signs of stabilization in global raw material markets. Prices for lithium, nickel, and cobalt remained relatively stable in 2024 - due in part to increased extraction and refining capacities as well as lower demand expectations.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) addresses the storage market in a recent episode of its podcast. Under the title “All Things Renewable,” the organization analyzes current trends in battery storage, covering costs, technologies, and applications.

Fifty-five heat waves over the past quarter-century would not have happened without human-caused climate change, according to a study published Wednesday.

Planet-warming emissions from 180 major cement, oil and gas producers contributed significantly to all of the heat events considered in the study, which was published in the journal Nature and examined a set of 213 heat waves from 2000 to 2023. The polluters examined in the study include publicly traded and state-owned companies, as well several countries where fossil fuel production data was available at the national level.

Collectively, these producers are responsible for 57% of all the carbon dioxide that was emitted from 1850 to 2023, the study found.

“It just shows that it’s not that many actors … who are responsible for a very strong fraction of all emissions,” said Sonia Seneviratne, a climate professor at the Swiss university ETH Zurich who was one of the study’s contributors.

The set of heat waves in the study came from the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, which the researchers described as the most widely used global disaster repository. The Nature study examined all of the heat waves in the database from 2000 to 2023 except for a few that weren’t suitable for their analysis.

Global warming made all 213 of the heat waves examined more likely, the study found. Out of those, 55 were 10,000 times more likely to have happened than they would have been before industrialization began accelerating in the 1800s. The calculation is equivalent to saying those 55 heat waves “would have been virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change, the authors wrote.

“Many of these heat waves had very strong consequences,” said Seneviratne. She said the series of heat waves that struck Europe in 2022 that was linked to tens of thousands of deaths sticks out in her mind as one of the events with particularly grave consequences.

Scientists calculate how carbon emitters influence heat waves

Climate scientists can use complex computer programs and historic weather data to calculate the connection between extreme weather events and the planet-warming pollutants humans emit. Climate change attribution studies often focus on how climate change influenced a specific weather event, but the scientists say this new Nature study is unique because it focused on the extent to which cement and fossil fuel producers have contributed to heat waves.

“They are drawing on a pretty well-established field of attribution science now, which has existed for about 20 years,” said Chris Callahan, a climate scientist at Indiana University who was not involved in the study. Callahan has used similar attribution methodologies in his research and said the new study is appropriate and high-quality.

Scientists say the new study could be taken into consideration in legal cases. Globally, dozens of lawsuits have been filed against fossil fuel companies by climate activists, American state governments and others seeking to hold the companies accountable for their role in climate change.

For example, Vermont and New York have passed laws that aim to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their emissions and the damage caused.

“For a while, it was argued that any individual contributor to climate change was making too small or too diffuse a contribution to ever be linked to any particular impact. And this emerging science, both this paper and others, is showing that that’s not true,” said Callahan.

Justin Mankin, a Dartmouth College climate scientist who wasn’t involved in the study, said the findings provide insight into the origins of the heat waves and how potential hazards from them could be minimized in the future.

“As we contend with these losses, the assessment of who or what’s responsible is going to become really important,” Mankin said. “I think there are some really appropriate questions, like who pays to recoup our losses, given that we’re all being damaged by it.”

In May, it was reported that the US Navy planned to build a data center at Guam’s Andersen Air Force Base.
This would be CyrusOne's second data center in California.","The AI-optimized data center will be colocated with a dedicated on-site energy generation facility built by Ameresco, forming a microgrid system that includes engine generators, control systems, and infrastructure upgrades. The Naval Air Station Lemoore is located on the border of Kings County and Fresno County in California.

“This initiative directly supports our national priorities in AI and energy dominance,” said NAS Lemoore executive officer captain Jeffry Findlay. “By enabling secure, reliable power and compute infrastructure at NAS Lemoore, we’re strengthening our ability to support critical missions and ensure operational continuity for those who serve.”

CyrusOne has been tapped to deliver the data center infrastructure, which will be part-based on the capabilities of its Intelliscale platform. The platform is designed for AI and high-density computing.

According to the partners, the facility will be engineered to meet stringent federal security and compliance standards, including FedRAMP, FISMA High, and DoD Impact Levels 5 and 6, and will align with NIST cybersecurity frameworks.

For the most sensitive workloads within the data center, the facility will feature air-gapped architectures, cross-domain solutions, and zero-trust security models to ensure data integrity and mission assurance. Across all other workloads, the data center will be designed to handle the extreme computational intensity of advanced processors optimized for parallel processing, model training, accelerated inference, and real-time analytics.

“The facility at NAS Lemoore will provide our federal customers with the secure, on-premise computing solution they need—paired with the resilience of onsite energy supply,” said John Hatem, EVP and CEO of CyrusOne. “Data centers are foundational to our information economy and critical to maintaining U.S. leadership in technological innovation, especially in AI. We’re proud to deliver this solution through our alliance with Ameresco.”

The first segment of the project is expected to come online in 2027 on land leased by Ameresco from the Department of Defense. The capacity of the data center and associated generation assets has not been disclosed. Ameresco has stated that, although the development agreements are still being finalized, it anticipates that it will be one of its largest energy assets.

“Ameresco is proud to develop energy infrastructure at NAS Lemoore that directly supports the growing demand for AI-ready data centers and related energy infrastructure,” said Nicole Bulgarino, president, Federal Solutions & Utility Infrastructure at Ameresco. “We look forward to working with the Navy and CyrusOne to develop this critical infrastructure that supports energy resiliency for the installation and meets the unique energy and reliability requirements of advanced AI data center workloads.”

News on the project first emerged back in October of last year, when it was reported that the Navy was working on a deal to lease 920 acres of land around Naval Air Station Lemoore to Ameresco.

According to reports, Ameresco was planning to construct a 425MW solar farm, which would have supplied power to an on-site data center. No news of a solar array was mentioned in the release announcing the partnership with the US Navy and CyrusOne.

Ameresco is an energy solutions provider headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts. It runs solar projects in the US, Canada, and Europe, including at several existing sites in California.

With a $1.3 billion investment, the facility will assemble battery electric SUVs based on the RAV4 and Land Cruiser models, alongside a new three-row BEV for the U.S. market Gov. Beshear: Toyota Increasing Investment to $1.3 Billion[ 1 ]. This move, part of a broader $10 billion investment in the plant since its inception, underscores Toyota's commitment to aligning production with regional demand while reinforcing local job stability Toyota is Bringing Electric Car Production to Kentucky[ 2 ]. For investors, the question remains: How does this strategic shift position Toyota—and traditional automakers more broadly—for long-term success in an increasingly electrified automotive landscape?

Strategic Implications: Local Production and Hybrid-First Approach

Toyota's decision to manufacture electric SUVs in Kentucky reflects a calculated strategy to balance electrification with profitability. By producing vehicles in the U.S.,

Analysts argue that this flexibility allows Toyota to adapt to markets with underdeveloped EV infrastructure, such as rural areas, while maintaining profitability Automakers Winning and Losing Market Share in 2025[ 7 ].

Comparative Analysis: Toyota vs. Peers in the EV Transition

Traditional automakers are navigating the EV transition with varying degrees of urgency. Ford, for instance, has retooled its Stanton, Tennessee campus for EV production and secured a $9.6 billion loan for battery plants, despite delaying its next-gen electric pickup to 2027 A look at 2025: Major Auto Manufacturing Projects[ 8 ]. GM, meanwhile, has shifted production lines back to ICE vehicles in response to fluctuating demand, highlighting the industry's uncertainty Trends and Challenges Shaping the Automotive Industry in 2025[ 9 ]. In contrast, Toyota's measured approach—prioritizing hybrids while incrementally scaling BEV production—has drawn both praise and criticism.

Critics argue that Toyota's slower EV rollout risks ceding market share to

and Chinese automakers like BYD, which dominate global EV sales Global EV Outlook 2025: Trends in Electric Car Markets[ 10 ]. However, proponents highlight Toyota's financial discipline: The company's 9.98% operating margin and $70 billion R&D investment over the next decade position it to sustain profitability during the transition Toyota's Financial Strategy & Goals Over the Years[ 11 ]. Moreover, Toyota's focus on solid-state battery technology and renewable energy integration—such as its goal to use 100% renewable electricity in global plants by 2035—suggests long-term innovation potential Toyota's Environmental Challenge 2050[ 12 ].

Financial Performance and Analyst Insights

Toyota's fiscal 2025 results reveal a mixed picture. Despite a 37% drop in net profit due to U.S. tariffs and rising material costs, the company raised its operating profit forecast to $18 billion, reflecting confidence in hybrid-driven sales Toyota's Value Looks Tempting Even As EV Risks Loom[ 13 ].

Risks and Long-Term Outlook

Toyota's EV transition is not without risks. The company's reliance on hybrids exposes it to regulatory pressures in markets like the EU, where stricter emissions targets may favor full BEVs Trends in Electric Car Markets – Global EV Outlook 2025[ 18 ]. Additionally, U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports and currency volatility could erode profit margins Toyota's Value Looks Tempting Even As EV Risks Loom[ 19 ]. However, Toyota's diversified strategy—combining hybrids, BEVs, and hydrogen—provides a buffer against these headwinds.

For traditional automakers, the path to electrification is increasingly defined by adaptability. While Toyota's approach may appear cautious, its emphasis on hybrid technology, renewable energy, and localized production offers a blueprint for sustainable growth. As the global EV market matures, investors must weigh the risks of slow EV adoption against the rewards of a company with a proven track record of innovation and operational efficiency.

Conclusion

Toyota's strategic shift to electric SUV production in Kentucky is a calculated step toward electrification, reflecting the automaker's commitment to balancing innovation with profitability. While its hybrid-first approach may lag behind the aggressive EV strategies of some peers, Toyota's financial resilience, global scale, and focus on localized production position it as a compelling long-term investment.

Moreover, it has already confirmed orders for all of its 4GW solar cell production capacity across its plants through the first half of 2026, with the US a key customer for its cells.
Toyo Solar acquires VSUN brand Toyo Solar also announced that it had acquired the VSUN brand from its sister company, the Vietnam Sunergy Joint Stock Company, as it looks to “consolidate the VSUN brand” under the Toyo Solar brand, according to chairman and CEO Junsei Ryu.
The deal did not involve the issuance of new equity by Toyo Solar, and will look to unite two brands that are both controlled by majority shareholder the Abalance Corporation.
The news follows a lawsuit filed by leading Chinese module manufacturer JinkoSolar against VSUN Solar USA, its subsidiary in the country, and Toyo Solar in December.","Over the past 18 months, the company has seen stronger financial and production performance in the first half of the year, as shown in the graph below. Toyo Solar attributed much of this growth to the development of its Ethiopian cell manufacturing plant, which began commercial operation in April.

The company expects to add a further 2GW of annual nameplate cell capacity at the Vietnam facility by October of this year.

Moreover, it has already confirmed orders for all of its 4GW solar cell production capacity across its plants through the first half of 2026, with the US a key customer for its cells.

In its financial results, Toyo Solar noted that Ethiopia is exempt from US tariffs for bifacial solar cells, and in November last year, the company acquired a 2.5GW module assembly plant in Texas, at which 1GW of trial production has started.

The emphasis on US and Ethiopian production marks a shift away from Vietnam, where the company first began cell production in 2023, with a 2GW facility. The US’ imposition of antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) tariffs on solar cells imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam has made selling cells produced in these countries in the US all but impossible; Toyo Solar notes that the preliminary antidumping rate for cell shipments from Vietnam to the US could be as high as 271.28%.

As a result, the company plans to use its Vietnam plant to meet demand from the “non-US market”, namely India and Taiwan, and expects its Vietnamese manufacturing plant to break even this year.

Other forecasts include a significant increase in cell shipments – Toyo Solar expects to sell 4.2-4.4GW of cells this year – and revenue growth to US$375-400 million by the end of 2025, reflecting considerable optimism for the company’s operations in Ethiopia and the US.

Toyo Solar acquires VSUN brand

Toyo Solar also announced that it had acquired the VSUN brand from its sister company, the Vietnam Sunergy Joint Stock Company, as it looks to “consolidate the VSUN brand” under the Toyo Solar brand, according to chairman and CEO Junsei Ryu.

The deal did not involve the issuance of new equity by Toyo Solar, and will look to unite two brands that are both controlled by majority shareholder the Abalance Corporation. VSUN has sold 8GW of modules to the US since 2018, and looks set to feature prominently in Toyo Solar’s plans for US expansion.

The news follows a lawsuit filed by leading Chinese module manufacturer JinkoSolar against VSUN Solar USA, its subsidiary in the country, and Toyo Solar in December. While JinkoSolar did not specify which of its patents Toyo Solar and its associates had allegedly infringed upon, it noted that it owns 462 patents related to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology, the same technology used by Toyo in its cell manufacturing.

While Toyo Solar did not discuss this lawsuit in its latest results, the incident is the latest in a growing series of patent battles within the global solar industry, with many centred on TOPCon technology in particular as it becomes more common in the solar sector.

“A technology often has to reach critical mass, where either the potential recovery from enforcement or the potential risk of non-enforcement outweighs the investment that it takes to enforce the patents,” Eagle Robinson, head of Patents, US, at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, told PV Tech Premium last year. “I suspect that’s what we’re seeing with TOPCon technology.”

“With the newly acquired VSUN brand, we intend to build on its relationships with many of North America’s leading utility‑scale developers,” said Ryu. “We will continue to collaborate closely with our industry partners in our efforts to migrate key components to the US.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/toyo-solar.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 12:03:38.497540

As a Lutheran pastor who is committed to caring for God’s creation, I was deeply disappointed in the recent tax and spending bill passed by Congress.Amid many harmful and short-sighted effects (such as throwing millions of children, seniors and families off Medicaid and food assistance), this bill phases out tax credits for electric vehicles and wind and solar power, which will drive up consumer costs and increase climate pollution. That is in addition to proposed budget cuts for agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that monitor extreme weather. Reduced funding would leave communities more vulnerable. None of these policies reflect care for creation or love for the neighbor.

In positive contrast to this, on Sept. 21 there will be a nationwide celebration of clean-energy progress and a chance to stand up for the solar and wind power that’s making communities healthier, quieter and more affordable. Reformation Lutheran Church in Reiffton will be holding an event from noon to 2 p.m. We’ll have our building’s solar array on display as well as electric vehicles, e-bikes and solar ovens.

These changes are reshaping the competitive landscape for clean transportation technology companies and fleet electrification infrastructure providers, creating both opportunities and challenges for investors.

Strategic Shifts in HVIP 2025: Policy and Funding Dynamics

The 2025 revisions to HVIP reflect a dual focus on equity and scalability. For small fleets—defined as public or nonprofit entities with 20 or fewer vehicles or private fleets with annual revenue under $15 million—the base voucher value has been doubled, with a cap of five vouchers per fleetPolicy Changes for FY24-25 and Closure of Standard HVIP and Drayage Set-Aside, [https://californiahvip.org/news/policy-changes-for-fy24-25-and-closure-of-standard-hvip-and-drayage-set-aside/][ 2 ].

However, the policy landscape is not without constraints. Starting January 1, 2025, private fleets with 50 or more vehicles lost eligibility for new voucher requests, a move designed to prioritize smaller fleets and public entitiesPolicy Changes for FY24-25 and Closure of Standard HVIP and Drayage Set-Aside, [https://californiahvip.org/news/policy-changes-for-fy24-25-and-closure-of-standard-hvip-and-drayage-set-aside/][ 2 ]. Exceptions remain for fuel cell vehicle purchases, signaling continued support for nascent technologies. Meanwhile, the closure of programs like the Public School Bus Set-Aside and the Zero Emission School Bus and Infrastructure (ZESBI) project has redirected focus to remaining initiatives, such as the Drayage Truck Set-Aside and the reopening of the Innovative Small E-Fleet (ISEF) pilot in mid-2025 with $15 million in fundingSouthern California Stays the Course on Clean Transportation Innovation, [https://www.act-news.com/news/southern-california-stays-the-course-on-clean-transportation-innovation/][ 4 ].

The market reaction to these changes has been mixed. While HVIP's expanded incentives have bolstered demand for qualifying vehicles, broader macroeconomic factors—such as high interest rates and federal policy shifts—have introduced headwinds.

Analyst Perspectives and Investment Considerations

Analysts remain divided on the long-term outlook for HVIP-eligible companies. On one hand, the program's emphasis on disadvantaged communities and innovative ownership models aligns with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment trends, which have historically driven growth in clean energy sectorsCrux 2025 Mid-Year Market Intelligence Report Shows Resilient Growth in Clean Energy Finance Market Amid Policy Shifts, [https://fox2now.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/846505944/crux-2025-mid-year-market-intelligence-report-shows-resilient-growth-in-clean-energy-finance-market-amid-policy-shifts][ 10 ]. On the other, the Trump administration's rollback of federal climate policies and the phase-out of tax credits have created regulatory uncertainty, prompting some investors to adopt a cautious stanceTrump-fueled backlash 'intensified' flight from ESG funds, [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/28/trump-esg-funds-backlash.html][ 8 ].

For investors, the key differentiator lies in a company's ability to navigate these dual pressures. Firms like Bollinger and RIZON, which have secured HVIP eligibility and diversified into as-a-service models, are better positioned to capitalize on state-level incentives. Conversely, companies reliant on federal subsidies or large fleet contracts may face headwinds as policy priorities shift.

Conclusion: A Balancing Act for Investors

California's HVIP 2025 represents a pivotal moment for clean transportation innovation, offering both financial incentives and regulatory clarity for early adopters. While the program's focus on small fleets and disadvantaged communities underscores its equity-driven mission, the evolving policy landscape demands strategic agility from companies and investors alike. For tech stocks like BINI and RIZON, the path forward hinges on leveraging HVIP's expanded incentives while mitigating risks from federal policy shifts and market volatility.

As the ISEF program reopens in mid-2025 and the implementation workgroup convenes in May, stakeholders will be watching closely for signals of sustained momentum in the clean transportation sector. For now, the interplay between state-level innovation and federal uncertainty ensures that HVIP-eligible companies will remain a focal point for investors seeking to align portfolios with the decarbonization agenda.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 14:01:28.371316

There seems to be no new headline in the news these days that doesn’t hammer home the evolution of EVs.

The federal tax credit is about to go down the drain, sales of EVs are definitely not where they once were, and several automakers are backpedaling on their original EV roadmaps. Some are even dusting off old internal combustion technology. Even Canada, known for its progressive ideas and socialist-leaning politics, has put a hold on its EV Availability Standard.

And with the current administration in the White House, one that’s been rather vocal about its opinion of electric cars, to say nothing of its recent bill to thwart their progress, it really feels as though EVs are about to hit a dead end in America.

Are EVs doomed?

I obviously don’t have a crystal ball to answer that question. But the auto industry isn’t in its first crisis. And like all objects that consumers spend money on, it’s the market and the products inside it that will dictate where things will head next.

If you remove the noise and focus on that alone, you quickly realize that what we’re witnessing is all but a minor bump in the road. EVs are about to come roaring back — maybe less roar and more electronic hum.

Politically Driven, For All the Wrong Reasons

In the not-too-distant future, we’ll look back at that crucial moment in history when electric vehicles (EVs) became political weapons.

How on Earth did humanity use an automobile as a way to identify in which direction a political party is leaning? Drive an EV, and you’re a Democrat. Burn gasoline, and you’re a Republican. Drive a Tesla, and uhm, I’m not exactly sure what you’re supposed to be these days. It has all become so weird.

I’m well aware that no matter how I phrase this, a few tomatoes will be flying my way. But, EVs were never put here to please anyone. They were put here by necessity, to help us all collectively reduce our CO2 emissions directly linked to climate change.

No, EVs are not the solution to our carbon problem. They’re part of the solution. And, for now at least, they’re the best idea we’ve come up with, at least as far as light-duty transportation is concerned.

Now, I don’t want you to feel bad about not owning an electric car. I don’t own one myself. That’s not the point here. I’m well aware that EVs could be either too costly or too worrisome due to range or charging. Maybe you just don’t want things to change and would prefer sticking to gasoline for now. It’s more convenient. And that’s quite all right.

But would the right thing to do — for us, humans, I mean — be to continue burning fossil fuels and warming up the planet? I’m not sure we want that.

The Good, Cheap EVs Are Coming

Political pressures and government legislation aside, there’s a cold, hard truth happening at the dealership level right now. Cars are too expensive, slowing consumers down, and causing them to reconsider the purchase of that brand-new car. This is not just attributable to EVs, but also to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

Such a phenomenon has spawned a new vocabulary at automakers lately. Words like “affordable,” “cheap,” and “cost-effective” have all been included in their latest announcements, speeches, and press releases.

Ford is about to unleash an electric platform that’ll supposedly bring down costs. Volkswagen is working with Rivian to include its technology to increase profit margins. And, if Slate Autos succeeds, we could soon witness the return of the truly affordable small truck.

Automakers are not going to let themselves die. If some decide to keep their heads in the sand, it’s just a matter of time before the market catches up with them.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe recently said in a podcast with Doug DeMuro that for the sake of competitiveness against China, America’s automakers need to continue investing in EV technology. That’s because China is not only ahead of us in that regard, but electric propulsion has also become the country’s main source of locomotion.

Cheap EV More Likely Than a Cheap ICE Vehicle

Building a truly affordable car that American consumers actually want to own is no easy task. While the U.S. is the world’s largest consumer vehicle market, it’s also the most difficult one to penetrate.

Consumers now want it all. And when it comes to cars, they not only want it all, but they also don’t want to pay the price for it. The premise of “yes, but you’re getting that many screens for that price!” no longer stands. The next cheap car will need to be affordable and very different than what’s currently available.

And that’s the thing. In order for that to happen, the only logical way out for automakers is through EVs. Because as the technology evolves, as battery manufacturing scales, and costs begin to shrink, EVs will likely end up costing less to build than an ICE equivalent. We’re actually already nearing parity in that regard.

In the early 1980s, not long after the oil crisis, while we were all locked in deep within the Cold War, the luxury car market was not doing too well. To reinvigorate sales, Mercedes-Benz spent more than $3 billion (in today’s money) developing a revolutionary type of luxury automobile: smaller, more efficient, more affordable, and over-engineered. The 190E redefined the very definition of a luxury car and attracted a whole new demographic to the brand.

The reason I’m mentioning this car is that it is a concrete example of an automaker releasing a category-changing model that alters the course of automotive history. I predict that we’re on the verge of witnessing something similar in the EV space.

It’s not yet clear who will get there first. But the day a truly cheap EV with compelling range, fast charging times, and loaded with value hits the market, no legislation or political pressure will stop it. Here’s to hoping America gets there first, but China is well ahead in this race currently.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/GFV_3721.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 14:01:43.339437

“New solar projects account for more than half of the new generating capacity expected to come online this year,” EIA said.
Growing international demand and increases in U.S. exports that are outpacing new gas production are in large part driving up natural gas prices.
Utilities and hyperscalers looking to meet energy demand from data centers are seeking new gas generation, but the lead time to bring a gas plant online has increased over the last few years.","Generation by the electric power sector is expected to grow 2.3% this year and 3% in 2026, exceeding a January forecast of 1.5% growth per year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

“Electricity generation has been growing rapidly this year as a result of growing demand for power from data centers and industrial customers,” EIA said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook, released Tuesday. “The higher growth in generation reflects colder-than-expected weather earlier in 2025 along with the incorporation of load growth assessments by grid operators in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and PJM systems.”

Meeting that increased demand are increases in generation from “most energy sources” this year, EIA said. The agency forecasts that utility-scale solar will grow the most in 2025, “generating 33%, or 72 billion kilowatthours (BkWh), more electricity this year compared with 2024.”

U.S. electricity generation totaled 4,300 BkWh in 2024. EIA expects it to total 4,400 BkWh in 2025 and to rise to 4,530 BkWh in 2026.

“New solar projects account for more than half of the new generating capacity expected to come online this year,” EIA said. “Wind, hydropower, and nuclear all grow this year as well. We expect wind will generate 4% more electricity in 2025 than it did in 2024, while we expect hydropower generation will grow by 2%. Nuclear generation will rise slightly this year and about 2% next year with the restart of the Palisades plant in Michigan.”

Natural gas generation, on the other hand, is not expected to grow this year – despite record consumption. Natural gas fuel prices are about 40% higher this year than last year, “which is encouraging more coal-fired generation but is also reducing the amount of electricity produced by natural gas-fired generators,” EIA said.

Growing international demand and increases in U.S. exports that are outpacing new gas production are in large part driving up natural gas prices. Utilities and hyperscalers looking to meet energy demand from data centers are seeking new gas generation, but the lead time to bring a gas plant online has increased over the last few years.

Hyundai's Ioniq 5 scores well for its attractive design, flexible and practical interior, and broad range of attributes. The base price kicks off at just over the $40K mark, but for the road warriors in the audience, the rear-wheel-drive SE with the big battery pack is the way to go. If you take delivery in time to apply the full $7500 credit, you're getting 318 miles of pure electric potential range for roughly the price of a plug-in hybrid Tucson.

2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV, for sale on the Car and Driver Marketplace.

Something like this black-over-gray 2025 SE would fill the bill perfectly: comfortable and unfussy transportation for racking up clean miles. The SE is pretty well equipped with comforts like standard heated seats and dual-zone climate control, as well as all the tech you really need with a 12.3-inch touchscreen display and standard wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay functionality.

However, Hyundai does provide the Ioniq 5 in a spicier flavor, and while tracking one down can be a bit tricky, we turned up this 2025 Ioniq 5N in appropriately scorching Soultronic Orange. With 641 horsepower on tap—more than you get out of a Lamborghini Huracán—it's a barn burner of a Hyundai, and scored a 10/10 pick.

Working Hard

While you won't find a Rivian R1T on the rebate list, as it exceeds the MSRP cap, you can apply that $7500 toward an electrified pickup truck. Ideal for a small business with hauling duties, a Ford F-150 Lightning also makes for the perfect helper for the DIY crowd.

While you can step up to the fancier Platinum grade trim for the urban cowboys out there, we found this ready-to-roll-up-its-sleeves XLT for under $50K before applying the federal EV rebate. As is typical for America's bestselling full-size pickup, Ford has plenty of finance incentives on top of the tax break for being an EV.

Family Matters

Three-row kid haulers are the other type of workhorse automobile that so many families depend upon. If you're feeding and clothing a brood, getting your hands on that rebate will sure help out with the weekly grocery bill.

One high-scoring option on the list is Kia's EV9, which is practical, pragmatic, and well priced for the segment. While the top-of-the-range GT-Line has all the bells and whistles and looks handsomely futuristic on its 21-inch wheels, the one-step-down Land trim is still crammed with tech and has middle-row captain's chairs for your kids to fight over.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-kia-ev9-land-awd-123-1-664ca7bc84133.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.161xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-09-10 12:03:19.637203

So coupling the soon-to-be expired EV tax credits with a forecasted drop in EV sales upon credit expiration creates a predictable situation.
This growth is jettisoned by EV sales and China is at the forefront.
The risk of falling further behind Chinese EV producers for the still-growing EV market across the world should be enough for the U.S. automakers to remain active in EV investments.
While the rate of investment in U.S. EV production capacity has admittedly slipped, a too-sudden exit may not be amenable to compete across the globe.","The phasing out of federal tax credits for EVs is creating a predictable rush for consumers, dealers and automakers alike, but as this occurs real time one must ponder, what next?

Nobody should have been surprised when President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress eventually ended the federal $7500 tax credit. And now that we are within a month of its completion, nobody should be surprised with the fire-sale-like atmosphere to take advantage of it before it ends, as August 2025 is expected to reveal a record month for EV sales once the tally is complete.

However, this fire sale is more of a fire lease, as the incentives are heavier for leases. Per the research firm Edmunds, the average lease price for EVs in August 2025 was $624 per month versus $670 per month for an internal combustion vehicle. This is no accident, as stipulations in the language of the incentive allow the dealer, not the purchaser, to be considered the owner allowing the lessee ability to gain the benefit of the credit regardless of income. For the most part, EV purchases do not generate the same discount rates as leases since the dealership would no longer be able to claim the full credit regardless of vehicle price, assembly location, battery sourcing, or lessee income. Therefore leases offer more dealership flexibility. The result is not surprising, in July EV leases accounted for about 75% of EV transactions compared to 16% of gas-powered vehicle transactions.

This is a compelling approach, as the lessor traditionally owns residual risk in an automotive lease transaction. Automotive OEMs will use captive finance arms (even if legally separate) as a strategic tool to drive sales. Since leases are a specific transaction where the dealer buys the vehicle, marketing incentives from the OEM may be necessary to address the marketability of slower moving vehicles.

So coupling the soon-to-be expired EV tax credits with a forecasted drop in EV sales upon credit expiration creates a predictable situation. Vehicles once thought out of reach are priced to move. In some hot spots, like Colorado, one can find $40 per month leases on a Kiro Niro EV, a $189 per month lease on a EV9 that has a $65,000 sticker price and a $169 per month lease on a Nissan Ariya with a $57,000 sticker.

But once September 30 is behind us, what happens next?

A recent dip at the end of 2024 cut short a consistent rise in EV share of overall new U.S. vehicle sales which had been intact since COVID. The sales outlook for EVs in the U.S. is looking bleak as domestic policy headwinds have taken the tax credit away along with the relaxation of regulatory pressures on internal combustion powered vehicles. These headlines dominate the EV news landscape domestically but there are positive signs to consider.

Many states are poised to fund their own EV tax credits. A total of at least 20 offer some form of tax break for EV purchases and leases. Additionally EV buyers tend to be sticky, staying loyal to EVs after making the initial shift.

But these are more anecdotal signals which do not reveal a high confidence that EV sales will maintain any resemblance of what they are projected to be in the last months of the U.S. tax credit. It is true that the domestic automakers have pulled planned investments for EV production and battery production, but perhaps there are some “green shoots” to show there will be significant domestic EV production beyond the tax credit.

When the focus switches from the United States to the world, the share of vehicles doubles from 10% of new sales to 20%. This growth is jettisoned by EV sales and China is at the forefront. In 2023, China surpassed Japan as the world’s largest automotive exporter. In 2024, Chinese automakers produced over 31 million units, with EVs accounting for 41% of that figure. (For comparison, the U.S. domestic auto market was roughly 16 million). BYD, the Chinese EV juggernaut, edged out Tesla in 2024 to produce the largest number of EVs globally. So while the momentum for EV sales and leases may be slowing in the U.S., the momentum around the globe seems to march on.

Perhaps this is what Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, had in mind when he stated he has a Chinese-made EV and loves it. Specifically, he was speaking of the Xiaomi SU7. While this company is not BYD, it does benefit from being well-positioned with the economic forces that allow Chinese companies to excel in the global EV market ‒ low labor costs, simpler battery supply chains thanks to domestic access to rare earth minerals and government-subsidized research and development. Experts believe China is poised to dominate the global EV market and believe we are only seeing “the beginning.”

So Ford’s decision to invest almost $2 billion in a Louisville-based factory to produce a mid-sized EV truck with a $30,000 sticker price should not be surprising when considering this global perspective. The risk of falling further behind Chinese EV producers for the still-growing EV market across the world should be enough for the U.S. automakers to remain active in EV investments.

This model has potential but faces several obstacles.

Smart tech, clear incentives and supportive policies are key to scaling opportunities for flexumers to participate in the energy transition.

In today’s world, electricity consumers are largely treated as passive recipients of power. But in tomorrow’s system, they will be recognized as agents of flexibility.

In truth, different buildings and sites can actively support the grid, including houses, schools, hospitals, restaurants, shops, e-charging stations, depots, factories and data centres. By adjusting when and where electricity is used, such participants can, for example, ease pressure on the system by avoiding congestion, making it smoother for variable renewables to be integrated. In turn, this accelerates the clean energy transition and reduces the overall cost of electricity.

We simply must start to design for participation, transforming these complex interactions in user-friendly exchanges. Digital tools are making it easier – even effortless – for users to automate their energy use, tap into flexibility markets and contribute to grid stability.

Why flexumers matter now

We all know electricity grids are under pressure. To cite Rome as an example, grid demand in the city is expected to rise from 2,200 MW to 3,300 MW by 2032. At the same time, new renewable generation must be accommodated. This will add to volatility, congestion and connection delays.

What if, instead of simply expanding supply, we shifted the focus to how electricity is used?

Demand-side flexibility, enabled by smart technologies to reduce, shift or modulate electricity use, can improve utilization of existing grid infrastructure by up to 20%. According to a recent case study in the Netherlands, TenneT was able to unlock 9 GW of grid capacity by working with flexible users while helping them save up to 65% on tariffs.

As households, vehicles and businesses become more digitized and electrified, the opportunity grows. Unlocking that potential will not happen on its own. It requires deliberate design, collaboration and leadership from across the energy ecosystem. This will require action from all of us in the energy industry.

Barriers to broader participation

Despite its potential, the flexumer model faces several obstacles. Cost remains a key concern. This includes the upfront investment in smart devices, the complex onboarding process and ongoing operational risks. Many consumers lack the knowledge or incentive to engage. They’re discouraged by obscure pricing models and unclear value propositions. So too, cultural resistance also plays a role as many consumers find it hard to kick old energy habits with shifts “feeling” too complex.

Technical hurdles, such as device compatibility or lack of automation, also slow adoption. For businesses, concerns around interference with core operations, such as maintaining indoor climate or production schedules, are a big issue too.

Alongside breaking down these barriers, scaling flexumer models is also critical. For the energy transition to succeed, stakeholders must move beyond pilot programmes and commit to fully integrating flexumers into market structures, business models and operational planning.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

What it will take to unlock the revolution

To accelerate the transition from consumer to flexumer, three enablers must come together.

Value propositions must be clear and attractive. Participants need guaranteed savings or revenues delivered without compromising their comfort, business continuity, or control.

Seamless digital experiences are essential. Participation must be automated through smart meters, devices, apps and platforms that make flexibility easy (even invisible) for users.

Awareness and education are key. Campaigns that demystify participation and build trust are critical to change mindsets, particularly where regulation is shifting quickly.

What success looks like

RomeFlex, a pioneering pilot for local flexibility markets in Italy, offers a glimpse into what the energy future could look like. Spearheaded by Areti, the city’s Distribution System Operator (DSO), the initiative is designed to unlock flexibility from distributed energy resources through market-based auctions. The most recent auction in June 2025 drew over 1,300 flexumers (representing 21 MW). This is more than triple the participation seen just four months before. In total, the grid is expected to request 250 GWh of flexibility services in Rome by 2032.

RomeFlex’s predictive analytics and market-based procurement model align with the European Commission’s recommendations. The project shows how distributed flexibility, once harnessed, can scale rapidly and deliver measurable value.

Other cities are following suit. In Munich, Germany, electric vehicles could offer up to 1.2 GW of flexible grid capacity by 2030. Buildings equipped with AI are already cutting HVAC electricity use by nearly 16% in pilot programmes.

These examples show that the tools exist and that when stakeholders align, change can happen fast.

Everyone has a role to play

We often talk about energy users as the end point. In reality, they may be the most underutilised resource we have. Flexumers are enabled by an entire ecosystem.

DSOs like Areti, must develop grid services that can accommodate flexible demand. Technology providers play a role in delivering the digital tools and platforms that simplify participation and policy-makers and regulators must set clear rules that reward flexibility, modernize tariffs and streamline participation. Energy retailers must act as intermediaries, aggregating demand and translating it into market opportunities. Consumers, from households to businesses, must be empowered and incentivized to act.

Ultimately, it is a complex coordinated effort. Success will only be achieved through alignment of modern grid infrastructure, dynamic pricing, supportive regulation, innovative finance models and trusted digital platforms.

From passive to active

It’s a bold step towards more flexible, decentralized and sustainable energy systems. But it requires coordinated action. Consumers must be given the tools, incentives and knowledge to participate. This may involve adjusting energy use, connecting distributed assets, or joining local flexibility markets. Importantly, flexibility should not just be accessible but automatic. This is how we will move from ambition to adoption – and from consumer to flexumer.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_8B_9mxZjfH4j_i3VKwp15saLXg7-L0c5B5jMHOM8FE8.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 12:03:46.490981

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WASHINGTON — Today, the House Committee on Natural Resources is holding a hearing for the proposed Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. The bill prioritizes the interests of the fossil fuel and mining industries at the expense of essential protections for clean air, water, public health, and access to justice.

In response, community leaders living on the frontlines of fossil fuels and mining issued the following statements:

Anna Darian, Executive Director, Patagonia Area Resource Alliance, said:

“As a frontline community in Patagonia, AZ, downhill from an industrial mine, and encircled by mountains with mining claims on nearly every square inch, we are calling on all representatives to stand firm on environmental protections and vote NO on the SPEED Act. It is imperative that our agencies consider the cumulative impacts of projects in a desert community already suffering under decades of mega-drought conditions.”

Roishetta Sibley Ozane, Founder and Executive Director, The Vessel Project of Louisiana, said:

“The proposed SPEED Act represents a significant step backward for environmental protections and public participation in our democratic processes. By undermining the National Environmental Policy Act, this legislation not only silences communities but also prioritizes corporate interests over the health of our planet and the voices of those most affected. We must stand firm against this bill to ensure that our environmental standards remain robust and that all stakeholders, especially our communities, have a say in decisions that impact our lives and environment.”

James Hiatt, Founder and Executive Director, For a Better Bayou, said:

“NEPA isn’t red tape, it’s our seat at the table and our right to protect our homes. The SPEED Act would strip that away, handing corporations a blank check to move faster while leaving the rest of us to pay the price. When public review is cut off, when independent science is ignored, and when courts are closed to communities, corporations get to externalize every cost (polluted air, poisoned water, destroyed lives and livelihoods) onto families who had no say in the first place. I’ve watched industry make billions while my community shoulders the sickness, the flooding, and the loss of our way of life. This bill isn’t about efficiency; it’s about shielding corporate profits from accountability. Communities like mine have already paid too high a price. Please reject this bill.”

Manning Rollerson, Founder and Executive Director, Freeport Haven Project, said:

“As a resident of Freeport, Texas and a veteran who took an oath to serve my country, I disagree with the SPEED Act because it loosens protections for communities and costs me my future, my children’s future, and now my grandchildren’s future. America does not protect the health and safety of its citizens. Human beings are being sacrificed for the global industry by its own United States government. When I say enough is enough, that’s because people are fed up with loved ones dying early because of somebody else’s reckless and dangerous ways that they process chemicals in our communities and no one is held accountable. Enough is enough.”

Fermina Stevens, Executive Director, Western Shoshone Defense Project, said:

“The United States is a government of immigrants without cultural or spiritual ties to the land that makes laws destroying biodiversity for their own benefit. This is not new though. For hundreds of years the United States government has been breaking their laws at the expense of others. The Western Shoshone Nation is very aware of the broken rules and processes that lead to the violation of our human rights, land rights, and treaty rights. The SPEED Act is just another way to line the pockets of a few because following NEPA takes too long for insatiable greed. Their lack of consideration for the environment, people, and communities shows us their priorities and their lack of morality concerning the well-being of our earth mother. Speeding up mineral extraction without strong safeguards may lead to decades or even centuries of environmental degradation, diminished biodiversity, compromised water security, and lasting harm to Indigenous and rural communities. If our country is going to see real change, it begins with the protection of our most precious life sources. Land, Air, Water, Sun/Spirit (LAWS) is where lawmaking priorities should be, which is beneficial for all.”

Faron Owl, Tribal Council Member of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe said:

“The Quechan Tribe has successfully defended our sacred sites from destruction by mining companies for decades. We rely on NEPA to be informed of mining project impacts and consult with federal agencies on protecting our tribal cultural resources. I am opposed to the SPEED Act because it would limit tribal participation in the permitting process, and leave our ancestral lands open to exploitation by mining companies.”

Kathy Bancroft, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, Lone Pine Paiute and Shoshone Tribe, said:

“My peoples’ ancestral homeland of Payahuunadü, the land of flowing water, is constantly under threat from mining companies. These companies hope to build open-pit gold mines that would damage important Joshua Tree habitat, drain our scarce water resources, and irreversibly harm our tribal culture. Federal agencies are already skimping on the NEPA process. They don’t need any excuses to skimp further. I oppose the SPEED Act because we need tribal participation in the permitting process to protect our sacred lands from being destroyed by mining companies.”",https://earthworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Earthworks-Mission.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 14:02:05.152933

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) announced today a public comment period for its Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program Final Proposal, which outlines plans to bring high-speed internet to approximately 1,800 locations across the state. The draft Final Proposal can be found on DEEP’s website. The public comment period runs through September 16, 2025.

The draft Final Proposal details Connecticut's roadmap to connect 724 homes and businesses, as well as approximately 1,100 Community Anchor Institutions—including schools, libraries, and hospitals—that currently lack adequate internet service. This document is a critical step in securing federal BEAD funds allocated by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

“The BEAD Final Proposal is a strong plan to reach Connecticut locations that are still in need of broadband. It builds on the State’s existing efforts and accomplishments, significantly expanding broadband access to residents across the state through efficient federal fund management, stakeholder engagement, and community collaboration,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes. “We are encouraging everyone, including residents, local leaders, and internet service providers, to review the Proposal and share feedback. The Proposal outlines a path for a stronger, better-connected Connecticut and together, we will make this plan a reality.”

Connecticut's broadband expansion efforts have been enabled by strong cooperation among communities, local leaders, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This public comment period offers an opportunity for businesses, individuals, municipalities, tribal governments, and community organizations to share how expanded internet access impacts them.

“Access to reliable and affordable broadband is crucial -- from education, healthcare, and connecting with loved ones, internet access opens doors,” said Kevin Pisacich, Director of DEEP’s Office of Telecommunications and Broadband. “We invite everyone to review Connecticut’s Final Proposal and make their voices heard.”

The state has already made significant progress in expanding broadband access. As of the end of 2024, Connecticut has:

Expanded gigabit-speed broadband availability to nearly 850,000 locations statewide

Increased basic broadband access to 99.6% of Connecticut locations

Awarded ConneCTed Communities Grant Program (CCGP) funding to connect 4,293 previously unserved or underserved locations

The draft Final Proposal identifies which ISPs will provide service to each location and details what DEEP has already done to support the expansion of access to fast, affordable, and reliable internet service to every community in Connecticut. Award funding by the NTIA will be based upon review and approval of the Final Proposal.

The draft Final Proposal is available.

The agency will accept comments on the draft plan through September 16, 2025 at 5:00 pm. Comments must be submitted via email to DEEP.Broadband@ct.gov, or by mail to DEEP's Office of Telecommunications and Broadband, Bureau of Energy and Technology Policy, 10 Franklin Square, New Britain, CT 06051.

The ZEC program, originally established in 2016, has helped keep these plants operating.
If we allow these plants to shut down, New York won’t just lose reliable energy—we’ll pay the price and lose livelihoods and a substantial source of our safe, reliable energy.
Extending the ZEC program is a common-sense move that would send a clear signal: that New York values clean energy, working families, and energy security.
Renewing the ZEC program isn’t just good policy.","For decades, three nuclear plants along the shores of Lake Ontario have been running and powering New York with clean, reliable, safe electricity. These plants are not only the backbone of our energy grid – they are a pillar for the upstate New York economy. Now more than ever, we can’t afford to lose these essential nuclear plants.

That’s why we, as representatives of labor and upstate New York communities, are proud to be a member of the Carbon Free New York coalition and support the extensions of the Zero-Emission Credit (ZEC) program.

Our three nuclear plants generate nearly half of New York’s carbon-free electricity and 20% of the state’s total power supply. According to a new report release from our coalition, extending the ZEC program will save ratepayers $50 billion by 2050, add $38 billion to the state’s economy, support 14,400 good-paying jobs, and preserve $10 billion in tax revenues.

These plants are more than just power producers—they are economic lifelines. They anchor local communities through union jobs, charitable investments, and stable tax revenue. In 2024 alone, they avoided 16.4 million tons of carbon emissions—the equivalent of taking 3.5 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.

The ZEC program, originally established in 2016, has helped keep these plants operating. But with the program nearing renewal, their future is once again uncertain. If we allow these plants to shut down, New York won’t just lose reliable energy—we’ll pay the price and lose livelihoods and a substantial source of our safe, reliable energy.

Extending the ZEC program is a common-sense move that would send a clear signal: that New York values clean energy, working families, and energy security. The program has already proven effective. It’s time to renew and build on that success.

The Carbon Free New York coalition brings together labor, business, environmental groups, and economic development organizations from across the state. We may come from different places, but we’re united by a shared goal: keeping New York on the path to a cleaner, stronger energy future.

Renewing the ZEC program isn’t just good policy. It’s the right thing to do for workers, for our communities, and for the planet.

Let’s protect what works. Let’s invest in our future. Let’s keep nuclear power—and New York—strong.

What the new Tesla Megapack does differently Tesla says the Megablock design will allow developers to deploy 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of storage in just 20 business days.","LAS VEGAS — On Monday night in a subterranean hall under the Las Vegas Convention Center, Tesla released an upgraded version of its grid-battery product that will allow developers to build bigger energy-storage projects faster. That kind of acceleration is sorely needed as the storage industry positions itself to meet historic grid demand in the next few years.

While better known for its pioneering electric-car business, and the polarizing antics of CEO Elon Musk, the company is also a pacesetter in the fast-growing U.S. energy-storage industry.

Tesla’s white boxy Megapack product, which stitches together lithium-ion batteries inside a large container, has been a top competitor for years. Around the U.S., Megapacks play a crucial role in keeping the lights on: In Oahu, they enabled the safe retirement of Hawaii’s last coal plant; in Oxnard, California, they allowed the city to avoid building a gas plant on its coastline; across Texas, they’re helping lower electricity prices and avoid shortfalls during record heat waves, as are batteries from companies like Fluence and Wärtsilä.

But the storage industry is still young, with plenty of room to streamline operations and bring down costs. That’s what Tesla hopes to do with the new Megablock, which packages four Megapacks around one transformer.

One of these blocks holds 20 megawatt-hours of power, which can be discharged for up to four hours at peak capacity. Scaled up for a large project, 248 megawatt-hours can fit into an acre (for comparison, the Oxnard project packed in about 200 megawatt-hours per acre using earlier-generation Megapacks back in 2021).

Tesla is taking orders for Megablocks now and expects to ship starting in late 2026. The firm will manufacture them near Houston, with lithium-iron-phosphate batteries from multiple sources, including a 7-gigawatt-hour-per-year manufacturing line planned to be completed at the company’s Nevada Gigafactory in early 2026.

The timing is no coincidence. Tesla’s new announcement comes as AI computing gobbles up electricity in unfathomable quantities. The rapid construction of new power sources has emerged as a defining imperative for America’s tech industry as it races to achieve what it sees as the transformative benefits of advanced AI. President Donald Trump has claimed that global AI supremacy is a key priority, even as his administration has taken aggressive steps to choke off development of the nation’s fastest-growing sources of energy.

What the new Tesla Megapack does differently

Tesla says the Megablock design will allow developers to deploy 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of storage in just 20 business days. That’s an astonishing rate, if borne out in real-world conditions. The firm has made bold claims in the past that have failed to materialize on time if at all, like its visions of a widely adopted solar roof or a huge autonomous taxi fleet. But the Megablock doesn’t hinge on a fundamentally new product; it’s another step in the steady evolution of a flagship technology.

The Megablock’s main innovations are that it reduces the amount of electrical work required in the field while also packing in battery cells as densely as possible without going over the weight limit that triggers expensive specialized shipping protocols.

“For us, one of the key metrics was, what’s the maximum percent cell mass you can get?” said Mike Snyder, Tesla’s VP of energy and charging, in an interview after his presentation. ​“Because the cells are what matters. So we made sure we increased that. It’s an 86,000-pound box, and 75% of that is cell.”

A giant battery installation requires thousands of perfectly executed electrical connections, and mishaps can cause major problems. Megapacks come with their batteries pre-wired, allowing for factory-grade quality controls. But currently, each pack then needs to be connected to a medium-voltage transformer to ship power in and out, which takes up to 24 individual connections per pack.

“That’s just a lot of labor in the field, and it’s a lot of places where something can go wrong,” Snyder said. ​“One of those bolts, one of those cables, it causes downtime and you have to go fix it.”

The new Megablock, in contrast, needs just three connections per pack.

Notes from the battery underground

Tesla timed the unveiling for the opening night of RE+, the bustling solar and clean energy industry conference, but hosted it on Musk-affiliated turf: a station for his side project boring holes under the Las Vegas Convention Center. Attendees were invited to experience the thrill of being chauffeured in a manually driven Tesla through a one-lane tunnel — not necessarily a harbinger of the future of transport, but it was lit by colorful LEDs.

Musk himself was not on hand, but Snyder addressed the crowd from a stage that was also lit by LEDs and flanked by Cybertrucks and Tesla’s new humanoid automatons. The screen behind him lit up with sharply produced drone footage of massive Megapack installations in lush locales.

The spectacle offered an implicit riposte to the Trump Department of Energy, which a few days earlier had tweeted, ​“Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.” The claim reflected either a remarkable ignorance of energy storage, a longtime research and deployment priority of that very same department, or a desire to pretend batteries don’t exist.

Batteries accounted for 23% of new grid-scale capacity built in the U.S. last year, compared to just 4% of new capacity that came from the fossil-gas plants much admired by the Trump administration.

How to make a better battery

While Tesla’s CEO spent hundreds of millions getting Trump elected and a few months slashing the federal civil service, Tesla’s engineers kept hacking away at the problem of making better batteries.

The attention to detail goes down to the paint job.

If you look at enough photos of grid battery projects, they blur into beige anonymity. But seeing the Megablock up close, the coat of white paint held more allure than it does from afar, more of a pearlescent sheen. A Tesla tour guide told me the shade was selected to maximize reflection of heat from the sun, thus reducing the energy needed to keep the batteries cool. The central chamber of the Megapack features a supercharged version of a Model Y heat pump, borrowed from colleagues on the automotive side of the company to chill liquid cooling streams that keep Megapack batteries and inverters safe.

Also taking in the sight was Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral student and leading researcher on how the U.S. might power its data-center boom. He noted that speed to market has become the premium that large energy customers are clamoring for.

“The U.S. is just in a major capacity crunch right now,” Norris said. ​“We’re going to need all sources of peaking capacity that we can get, and battery storage and the Megapack solutions are a critical option.”

The U.S. is expected to build 18 GW of batteries this year, per federal data, up from 13 GW last year, with California and Texas continuing to lead the way. Trump’s actions have injected deeper uncertainty into the market in 2025, with tariff fluctuations and new anti-China regulations. But the big tax-and-spending law passed by Republicans in July kept energy-storage tax incentives in place for years to come, even as it gutted wind and solar tax credits, meaning the outlook for storage is less muted than it is for the renewables it’s often paired with.

Meanwhile, data centers haven’t yet become big installers of on-site batteries, Norris added, but that could start to happen in the next couple of years. The typical four-hour duration of commercially available batteries today doesn’t lend itself to a round-the-clock power supply, so data-center developers are still figuring out how best to slot batteries into their energy portfolios.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Megablock_sun-2025.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=07c058afbd0fcf2066c9a91e2ed2acbf,N,,2025-09-10 12:04:34.875021

OPINION – As the federal government turns its back on the clean energy transition—gutting decades of progress with the passage of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”—California now stands alone at a critical crossroads. With federal incentives slashed and funding for renewable projects drying up, the burden of clean energy leadership has shifted squarely onto Sacramento.

The Governor, State Legislature, and the renewable energy industry, now face perhaps their most consequential challenge yet: to deliver clean, affordable, and resilient energy for California in a time of growing national retreat and global uncertainty. We have many tools available to us. Just one opportunity – leveraging batteries and smart thermostats that are already in people’s homes — could create $13.7 Billion in energy savings in California, according to a Gridlab Study. The question is whether we will rise to meet this moment and set an example for the rest of the nation or let it pass us by.

California needs to think strategically about its electric grid and how it can be redesigned to reduce costs while maximizing clean energy abundance. In California, clean energy is increasingly cheaper because the state benefits from abundant sunshine, strong wind resources, and years of investment in renewable infrastructure. Falling costs for solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage, combined with the absence of fuel expenses, mean that new renewable projects can deliver power at lower prices. In today’s market, this makes clean energy the most sustainable and cost-effective option for California’s grid.

My legislative colleagues and I are leading this charge and have identified realistic and effective solutions for energy efficiency and affordability. Three of my bills this year are focused on expanding grid capabilities quickly and safely while cutting costs.

Senate Bill 254 tackles electricity affordability by streamlining the planning process and tackling the costs of wildfire prevention efforts, applying innovative financing approaches to reduce the cost of new grid investments, scrutinizing utility spending and rate proposals more rigorously compared to an inflation benchmark, making it faster and cheaper to build more clean energy resources, and directing more assistance to low-income utility customers through CARE and FERA.

Senate Bill 540 enables California to join other Western states in launching a multi-state energy market that will lower electricity costs, reduce the risk of rolling blackouts, and cut greenhouse gas emissions. By sharing resources with neighboring states, California can export some of its extra renewable energy on mild days instead of it going to waste and rely on energy from our neighbors on the hottest summer evenings when our grid is stressed.

We can also save money and reduce fossil fuel usage by reducing peak demand and efficiently using distribution grid infrastructure. Senate Bill 541 focuses on these opportunities to leverage demand-side flexibility, enabling homes and businesses to adjust electricity usage in real time. With the right policies, technologies like distributed batteries, smart thermostats, and EV chargers empower consumers to contribute to grid stability, lowering peak demand so we don’t have to turn on the dirtiest and most expensive peaker plants to meet the highest demand peaks. This is how we capture those $13.7 billion in annual savings that Gridlab identified.

Summer heat waves routinely expose the fragility of California’s aging energy grid, reminding us that work to strengthen the grid must continue. The state faces surging electricity bills, worsening grid instability, and escalating risks from extreme weather events. From the Central Valley to Los Angeles, families face painful tradeoffs between paying for groceries or electricity.

Meanwhile, energy-intensive industries like artificial intelligence push demand ever higher. Unless Sacramento steps up now, Californians risk planning their summers around rolling blackouts instead of family vacations.

Over two decades, California has proven clean energy leadership and economic growth can go hand in hand. The state has boldly proven that it’s possible to reduce emissions while growing the economy. But today’s goal is broader and more pressing: affordable power, a grid Californians can count on, and infrastructure built to support tomorrow’s economy without sacrificing reliability today.

The partnership, which began in 2022, has now deployed over 850 public fast charging stalls at more than 200 Pilot and Flying J travel centres across nearly 40 states. Addressing the lack of charging infrastructure along key travel routes was a major driver for the partnership, with the aim of enabling seamless coast-to-coast EV travel in the US.

The network’s rapid expansion will likely be felt most in rural areas, where charging options have historically been limited. At the start of 2025, only 45% of rural counties in the US had at least one fast charging option. The addition of new locations in states such as Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming will help bridge this gap between rural and urban locales. Significant expansions have also been made in high-demand states like Texas, Missouri, and Florida, ensuring that urban users won’t be left behind in the expansion.

The charging stations are equipped with EVgo’s 350kW fast chargers, which can add around 150-200 miles of range in as little as 15-20 minutes, while overhead canopies at many locations protect drivers from harsh weather, and pull-through stalls accommodate larger vehicles such as electric vans or those towing trailers.

Plug and Charge technology allows compatible EV models to automatically initiate and pay for a charging session simply by plugging in, eliminating the need for additional apps or third-party payment methods.

Pilot and Flying J locations are keen to point out that while charging, facilities, such as free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurants and convenience stores will help to while away the (significantly shorter) charging times.

Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot, highlighted the importance of the initiative: “Our fast-charging network raises the bar for convenience, reliability and exceptional service by offering an experience designed to show EV drivers that they matter.”

Simplifying EV charging

The EV industry is seeing a push to make charging as convenient and accessible as traditional refuelling. As a significant barrier to EV entry for many, this is particularly important as EV adoption continues to grow, and more drivers rely on public charging networks for long-distance travel. US fast-charging is currently deploying at a record pace, according to figures from data analysis firm Paren, which predicts the US will surpass 100,000 fast-charging ports in 2027.

Badar Khan, CEO of EVgo, emphasised the cultural significance of this development: “Hitting the open road is a natural emblem of American culture, and travelling by car means drivers can set their own schedule to stop and charge when and where they want.”

The network’s focus on interstate travel corridors is also noteworthy. These corridors carry over 20% of America’s total traffic, making them a key area for infrastructure development.

But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity.
“Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”","The Trump administration has been slashing green energy incentives, freezing the construction of wind farms and ordering coal-burning power plants to keep running longer than planned. And yet, more American homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

In June, almost one-quarter of U.S. power generation was green, up from 18% in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The question now is whether the trend continues with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The recent growth in renewables usage is almost certainly tied to investments made prior to Trump’s election in November. Under former President Joe Biden, the United States backed roughly $100 billion of investments in clean energy. Now, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to those efforts by opposing offshore wind farms and eliminating incentives for electric vehicles and solar power.

Still, Texas is a prime example of how the energy markets have changed. In early March, the state’s grid set a record for wind generation; in mid-June, it registered a new peak for electricity produced from renewable resources; and a month later, Texas notched new highs for battery storage and solar generation.

Similar records are popping up across the country on an almost weekly basis, as utilities harvest a windfall from new solar and wind farms that can be built faster and more affordably than fossil fuel-based power plants.

Here are five charts that capture a bit of the size and scope of America’s recent wave of green energy, showing where and how it’s happening, and what the landscape looks like going forward.

Nearly one-third

For utilities and folks operating the nation’s power grids, the wave of green energy couldn’t come at a better time because volatile weather, electric vehicles and a rash of AI-focused data centers are all driving up demand.

In April, as grid operators were girding for heat waves, nearly one-third of U.S. power was generated from renewable sources. And the green energy boom is spreading beyond the Sun and Wind belts. The New York grid hit a renewable record on June 24. New England recorded new highs for both wind and solar power this summer and the grid in the Mid-Atlantic states reported a record renewable harvest in late June.

“We’re in an entirely new landscape for load growth, so this is none too soon,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility policy director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Every solution available will need to be called on.”

What good is the dawn?

If all of the utility-owned solar panels in California were considered one facility, it would have ranked at the end of July as the second-largest power plant in the world. At noon on July 30, solar generation on the state’s CAISO grid hit 21.7 megawatts, second only to the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam on China’s Yangtze River.

For much of that day, the sun accounted for roughly two-thirds of the power Californians were using and the panels fed into batteries that, once the sun went down, juiced nearly one-third of the state.

Charge baby charge

The Texas power market is truly the Wild West of electricity.

As a deregulated, wholesale market, the state’s consumers can choose their provider and plants are only paid for what they produce. In this eat-what-you-kill energy world, utilities have turned en masse to a novel tool: big batteries.

These so-called storage facilities let power players sock away electrons when demand (read: prices) are low and discharge the juice when usage peaks. Often, the most economical strategy is storing solar power during the day and releasing it in the evening when the lights and TVs switch on and air conditioners are still humming.

A rash of new storage facilities have been switched on in Texas this year, shoring up the grid with record amounts of reserve power.

A mighty wind

In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the United States, it’s common for tractor trailers to get blown over onto their sides. Such is the power of the wind on the Great Plains. And it’s steady as well as strong.

On the Southwest Power Pool grid, which stretches from the Dakotas south to Texas, new records for wind power were reached twice in August alone. At one point on Aug. 16, almost two of every three electrons in the system were coming from turbines.

Clicking the boxes

Good, cheap or fast? Typically, one only gets to choose two of those things. But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity. So-called green energy is currently the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy power generator in the United States, even without incentives, according to research from Lazard Inc.

Given Trump’s attacks on green power, the decisions made by utilities have become more fraught than usual and a bit more complicated than just choosing the cheapest plant to build. In May, Gordon van Welie, chief executive officer of the ISO New England grid, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that his organization was counting on large quantities of offshore wind to meet rising demand. Three months later, the Trump administration ordered crews to stop working on a project off the coast of Rhode Island where 45 of 65 planned turbines have already been installed, a directive that it now has to defend in court.

The facility was expected to power roughly 350,000 homes. Administration officials say solar and wind is unreliable and too connected to China-based supply chains. Trump’s term, however, will likely be over long before any new coal-fired or nuclear plant can be built to replace that capacity.

“We need more electrons in this country and the industry seems to have an agnostic view,” said Lazard Managing Director Samuel Scroggins, referring to where electrons originate. “Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/PDTN/86073358007-bizusrenewableenergyget.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y308&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-10 11:02:34.891467

The world continues to ramp up production of electric vehicles (EVs) and related infrastructure, shipping over 3.2 million EVs globally in 2024. China comprised 40 percent of these exports, dominating the global market. The United States, which imposed an effective 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in May 2024, remained a net importer of EVs, largely from Mexico through US original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The United States’ main export market was Canada. Considering the substantial changes made so far in 2025 by the Trump administration, from raising tariffs on Canada and Mexico to the removal of EV tax credits, which incentivized domestic production, the calculus for a US strategic economic outlook has undergone a drastic transformation. Additionally, the United States is engaged, both rhetorically and practically, in an economic competition with China regarding global market control and influence, although it does not have to be this way.

US-China Competition

As the two economies have, each in its own way, sought to gain a competitive edge over global supply chains, the United States currently lags in its efforts to engage in the growing EV and battery sector. China has made significant advancements in offshoring some of its manufacturing, securing domestic footholds in both India and Europe. This was likely the context of a reported deal between Chinese Hithium Energy Co, one of the world’s biggest stationary battery manufacturers, in which the Chinese government is invested, and India’s largest company, Reliance Industries. This deal would see the export of key Chinese tech to India, where Chinese batteries would be produced in the first indication of a technology transfer between China and another global economic power.

Trump’s Energy-Focused Trade Strategy

The Trump administration has sought to compete in its own way by negotiating successful energy deals for oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). For example, the European Union (EU) agreed to purchase over $750 billion of LNG over the course of three years, and the United States has accepted the purchase of US oil as a concession to tariffs in numerous bilateral agreements coming in the aftermath of Trump’s Liberation Day. These deals mask the serious vulnerabilities of US global energy exports, failing to account for fundamentally changing supply chains and consumer demand.

Furthermore, many US manufacturers who were expanding capacity domestically have now cancelled their plans for new factories, due to the changes in market incentives. Battery manufacturers and lithium suppliers have been left with even greater uncertainty as downstream market effects have yet to materialize. Bloomberg recently reported that the United States is at risk of battery oversupply as purchases and production of EVs decline. Interestingly, this can be contrasted with China’s oversupply of solar panels.

China’s Renewable Energy Expansion

China’s role in global energy market competition has been advantaged not only by EV sales, but also by its success in solar panel manufacturing. Oversupply has led Chinese companies to find new markets in key developing regions, particularly in Africa. In fact, solar panel imports to Africa have nearly tripled in the last three years, with an increase of Chinese imports of 60 percent in only the last twelve months. Africa still relies heavily on imports of oil and natural gas; however, the huge growth in the installation of alternative energy generation shows the beginning of a permanent change. Chinese solar panel exports will undermine the United States’ energy-dominant exports, oil and natural gas, in the long run. As the United States seeks to expand its energy exports, particularly to countries like South Africa, which now faces 30 percent tariff rates, it may jeopardize the long-term sustainability of its export market.

US battery manufacturers, however, could learn from Chinese solar panel companies by finding new export markets. If the United States were to utilize its battery production and expand to exports, it could avoid permanent loss in its trade war with China. US battery inventories will need markets as EV sales decline in the United States. Considering that African countries are already transitioning to greater solar panel usage, those markets will need greater battery storage capacity. As China has already done in Africa, the United States could competitively enter alternative markets, supplying long-term and high-capacity energy storage units. In other words, the United States could use its oversupply of batteries to secure markets with untapped potential that will need battery capacity in the long run. While oil exports are expected to eventually decline, the United States can substitute the loss in oil demand with the increase in demand for energy storage.

Path Forward for US Energy Competition

This crucial strategic step could be a game-changer for US energy competition with China. Trump’s policies have led to uncertainty about the viability of manufacturing growth for the domestic battery and EV sectors. Nonetheless, an oversupply of batteries could be the key to successfully securing foreign export markets, leveling the playing field for the US in its competitive economic balancing efforts with China. US manufacturing has further struggled to meet the demands of the Trump administration by cutting its dependency on Chinese-made goods. A change in strategy with regard to batteries could be one method for meeting Trump’s agenda while still expanding growth.

“Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel.”

Expanding this network from 25+ states to nearly 40 in under a year, the companies continue to add charging availability across our nation’s countryside, where only 45% of rural counties had at least one fast charging stall available at the start of 2025.

Kemp has courted foreign investment to his state but also once offered to use his own pickup truck to round up ""criminal illegals."" Those two stances collided this past week when immigration authorities raided a battery plant and detained foreign workers, putting Kemp in a tough spot.

Some 475 people were held in the raid, including more than 300 South Koreans, at the construction site for a battery plant that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution slated to open next year. The battery plant is part of a $7.6 billion complex planned to eventually employ 8,500 people. It was announced and then expanded after trips by Kemp to South Korea to court officials at Hyundai and other firms.

The detentions sparked questions in South Korea about its relationship with the United States, especially when Hyundai and its partners. Hyundai has said it's investing $26 billion in the United States from 2025 to 2028. That includes not only the plant in Ellabell, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group makes electric vehicles, but a separate $5 billion battery joint venture in Cartersville, Georgia, a steel mill in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, a robotics hub and expansion of the Hyundai plant in Montgomery, Alabama and the Kia Corp. plant in West Point, Georgia.

Kemp has voiced support for immigration enforcement but been restrained in the raid's aftermath.

""In Georgia, we will always enforce the law, including all state and federal immigration laws. All companies operating within the state must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation,"" the governor's office said Friday in a written statement.

Kemp can't run again for governor in 2026 and passed up a U.S. Senate race, but has entertained talk of a 2028 run for president. He hasn't yet said anything about whether the raid will have a long-term impact on Hyundai's investments. On Friday, his office said only that the state Department of Public Safety had coordinated with ICE to support the raid.

Kemp's office didn't immediately respond to further questions Tuesday.

This is his second term as governor and he's declared a goal of making Georgia the "" electric mobility capital of America. "" But the Republican has also talked tough on illegal immigration, saying in a 2018 ad that ""I've got a big truck, just in case I've got to round up some criminal illegals and take them home myself,"" and backing a state law that requires local jails to check the immigration status of prisoners.

The raid comes as Kemp has been aligning more closely with President Donald Trump's administration on immigration enforcement and other issues. The governor has a long history of asserting his independence from Trump, which has at times led to headline-grabbing conflict. But Kemp last month announced he would mobilize 75 National Guard soldiers to provide support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Georgia. He followed that by announcing he would send more than 300 National Guard members to take part in Trump's law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.

Like most governors, Kemp seeks foreign investment, which has built up most of the auto industry in the South. Kemp has journeyed twice to South Korea to meet with Hyundai and other big investors in Georgia, including electric battery maker LG Group.

Kemp disputes claims that tax dollars were subsidizing the jobs of those detained. His administration says none of the $2.1 billion in projected state and local incentives for the Hyundai complex directly benefits subcontractors who employ detainees.

""Without exception, the Department of Economic Development expects anyone doing business in Georgia to follow federal and state laws,"" the department said.

Kemp has welcomed green energy investment and jobs, but has clashed with Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff over who should get credit for Georgia's green energy boom.

Kemp sharply disputes that incentives signed by President Joe Biden spurred investment, saying industries were already coming to Georgia before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022. But if anything, the rush accelerated after Biden signed his climate law.

The 33 additional projects announced by the end of 2024 were the most nationwide, according to E2, an environmental business group. Exact figures differ, but projects in Georgia top $20 billion, pledging more than 25,000 jobs.

Researchers will study the project’s performance over time, while a new initiative led by California universities and the company Solar Aquagrid will push to fast-track the deployment of solar canals across the state.
The purpose of these early arrays is primarily to power on-site canal equipment like pumps and gates.
Elevating solar panels over canals is more expensive and technically complex than installing conventional ground-mounted solar arrays on trackers, and it can involve using more concrete and steel.
DeJong said that construction is 90% complete on the tribal community’s second solar-canal project, a nearly 0.9-MW array built in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is slated to go online later this year.","A novel solar power project just went online in California’s Central Valley, with panels that span across canals in the vast agricultural region.

The 1.6-megawatt installation, called Project Nexus, was fully completed late last month. The $20 million state-funded pilot has turned stretches of the Turlock Irrigation District’s canals into hubs of clean electricity generation in a remote area where cotton, tomatoes, almonds, and hundreds of other crops are grown.

Project Nexus is only the second canal-based solar array to operate in the United States — and one of just a handful in the world. America’s first solar-canal project started producing power in October 2024 for the Pima and Maricopa tribes, known together as the Gila River Indian Community, on their reservation near Phoenix, Arizona. Two more canal-top arrays are already in the works there.

In California, the solar-canal system was built in two phases, with a 20-foot-wide stretch completed in March and a roughly 110-foot-wide portion finished at the end of August. Researchers will study the project’s performance over time, while a new initiative led by California universities and the company Solar Aquagrid will push to fast-track the deployment of solar canals across the state.

Proponents of this emerging approach say it can provide overlapping benefits.

Early research suggests that, along with producing power in land-constrained areas, putting solar arrays above water can help keep panels cool, in turn improving their efficiency and electricity output. Shade from the panels can also prevent water loss through evaporation in drought-prone regions and can limit algae growth in waterways.

Plus, solar canals could offer a faster path to clean energy development than utility-scale solar farms, especially in rural parts of the U.S. where big renewables projects increasingly face community opposition. Placing solar panels atop existing infrastructure doesn’t require altering the landscape, and the relatively small installations can be plugged into nearby distribution lines, avoiding the cumbersome process of connecting to the higher-voltage wires required for bigger undertakings.

“Why disturb land that has sacred value when we could just put the solar panels over a canal and generate more efficient power?” said David DeJong, director of the Pima-Maricopa Irrigation Project, which is developing a water-delivery system for the Gila River Indian Community.

The purpose of these early arrays is primarily to power on-site canal equipment like pumps and gates. But such projects could eventually help clean up the larger grid, too. A coalition of U.S. environmental groups previously estimated that putting panels over 8,000 miles of federally owned canals and aqueducts could generate over 25 gigawatts of renewable energy — enough to power nearly 20 million homes — and reduce water evaporation by possibly tens of billions of gallons.

Still, the technology isn’t an obvious choice for many canal operators.

Elevating solar panels over canals is more expensive and technically complex than installing conventional ground-mounted solar arrays on trackers, and it can involve using more concrete and steel. Wider canals may also require support structures for panels within the waterway, which can disrupt the flow of water.

Earlier this year, a senior engineer at Arizona’s Salt River Project recommended that the power and water utility not pursue a solar-canal pilot ​“based on cost estimates and project concerns,” after comparing the unique design to both rooftop and utility-scale solar alternatives.

Solar-canal developers are hoping they can still gain a toehold in irrigation districts that are grappling with high electricity costs and have limited options for generating cheap power, said Ben Lepley, the founder of engineering firm Tectonicus, which designed the Gila River Indian Community’s 1.3-MW system south of Phoenix.

The initial costs are ​“definitely higher … but it can actually be really fast as a project,” Lepley said. ​“By the next year, you can have really cheap electricity, and that gives [irrigation districts] stability over the 30-year life of the project.”

For its part, the Gila River Indian Community is building solar-canal projects as part of its broader mission to ​“generate enough renewable energy to completely offset the electrical use by the irrigation district,” said DeJong. He noted the district pays about $3 million a year for the 27 million kilowatt-hours of electricity it needs to pump, move, and store water.

The community built its first solar-canal project over the Casa Blanca Canal with a nearly $5.7 million grant provided by the Inflation Reduction Act — part of a $25 million provision that supplied funding for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to design, study, and deploy projects that put panels over waterways. Irrigation districts in California, Oregon, and Utah received the remaining funds to develop their own installations.

The Trump administration is unlikely to support future programs, given its focus on gutting clean energy incentives, but a handful of projects are already moving forward without such grants.

DeJong said that construction is 90% complete on the tribal community’s second solar-canal project, a nearly 0.9-MW array built in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is slated to go online later this year. The community is self-funding a similar-sized project over the Santan Canal and is developing a floating solar array on one of its reservoirs, with both systems set to be up and running by early 2026. All told, the installations will provide 4 MW in local clean energy generation, he said.

“We have become really familiar with the economics of building these [canal] projects,” said Lepley, whose firm also worked on the Gila River Indian Community’s second and third solar-canal systems. ​“We have a pretty good playbook of how to continue these projects going forward, even without any grant funding from the federal government.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Project-Nexus-wide.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1919238f7ccf7b27402e22c2c94b52ca,N,,2025-09-10 13:00:48.574222

“Fifty years of global Enhanced Geothermal Systems development have brought us to a turning point,” said Terra Rogers, Program Director for Superhot Rock Geothermal.
The report also examines the potential of emerging superhot rock EGS systems, which would access supercritical reservoirs above 375°C to deliver exponentially greater energy output per well.
Realizing this potential will require targeted research, development, and demonstration to close key technological gaps, which CATF has previously detailed.
Rogers continued: “The steady rise in EGS production temperatures shows encouraging progress, but at the current pace we risk leaving opportunities like superhot rock on the table.","A new report from Clean Air Task Force (CATF) finds that Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are closer than ever to large-scale commercialization after more than five decades of development. Drawing on a database of 103 historical and current EGS projects, the report documents steady improvement alongside recent step-change innovations that could enable EGS to scale rapidly and at lower cost if supported by sustained policy action, investment, and research.

“Fifty years of global Enhanced Geothermal Systems development have brought us to a turning point,” said Terra Rogers, Program Director for Superhot Rock Geothermal. “The progress documented in this report shows EGS advancing beyond the research phase toward becoming a commercially viable, scalable source of clean, reliable power and laying the groundwork for even higher-output superhot rock geothermal.”

“The data make the opportunity clear. With the right policy support, sustained investment, and continued research, EGS can deliver around-the-clock low-carbon energy in more places than ever before while opening new revenue streams from direct heat for industry and buildings, valuable minerals like lithium, and other co-production opportunities,” said Angela Seligman, Senior Geoscientist for Superhot Rock Geothermal at CATF.

Powering the Future: What 50 Years of Enhanced Geothermal Teaches Us Today compiles over 60 technical, operational, and financial characteristics from projects in 23 countries, the most extensive public record of EGS progress to date. The findings show that continued advancements in drilling performance, reservoir productivity, and cost reduction are positioning EGS to compete in more markets and geographies, though further development and demonstration will be needed to prove long-term performance at scale.

Key takeaways include:

Increasing production temperatures: Over time, projects are getting hotter, averaging approximately 10°C increases per decade.

Dramatic improvements in drilling performance: Recent projects have achieved drilling costs less than 20% of historical averages, with record-breaking penetration rates in commercial and research wells.

Higher production output: Flow rates in some projects exceed the widely cited commercial benchmark of 80 liters per second, alongside higher average production temperatures.

Scale and market confidence: EGS power purchase agreements signed since 2022 total more than ten times the combined capacity of all previous projects, suggesting increased confidence from offtakers in the technology’s near-term potential.

Diverse revenue streams: Many projects are incorporating direct heat, lithium extraction, and other co-production opportunities, which could strengthen commercial viability.

The report also examines the potential of emerging superhot rock EGS systems, which would access supercritical reservoirs above 375°C to deliver exponentially greater energy output per well. Earlier analysis by CATF and the University of Twente found that just 1% of global superhot rock resources could generate 63 terawatts of clean, firm power — more than eight times today’s total electricity generation. Realizing this potential will require targeted research, development, and demonstration to close key technological gaps, which CATF has previously detailed.

Rogers continued:

“The steady rise in EGS production temperatures shows encouraging progress, but at the current pace we risk leaving opportunities like superhot rock on the table. Faster innovation and investment to lower costs will be essential to bringing next-generation geothermal online in time to meet growing demand from data infrastructure, electrification, and energy access in the Global South.”

With continued technical progress, supportive policies, and greater market engagement, EGS could become a major source of affordable firm, low-carbon power, complementing wind, solar, and other clean energy resources to strengthen grid reliability worldwide.

The three plants owned by LG Chem in South Korea have a total production capacity of 80,000 tonnes of cathode material per year.
With a capacity for producing over 60,000 tonnes, Gumi is by far LG Chem’s largest plant producing cathode materials.
LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol said, “Toyota Tsusho’s equity participation marks a pivotal turning point as LG Chem strengthens its cathode supply competitiveness under the U.S. IRA framework.
We will further solidify our leadership in the battery materials market on the strength of world-class products and powerful global partnerships.”","Toyota Tsusho is the general trading company of the Japanese automotive giant, Toyota Group, playing a crucial role in the procurement of raw materials for Toyota Motor. As Toyota Tsusho is purchasing Huayou Cobalt’s 25 per cent stake in the South Korean cathode material plant, the Chinese company’s shareholding will be reduced from 49 per cent to 24 per cent. This will enable the plant’s products to comply with newly redefined US stipulations regarding foreign entities (PFE), demanding that entities with more than 25% ownership by restricted parties (here, China) may be excluded from relevant tax credits in the USA.

The other major stakeholder in the plant, South Korean battery giant LG Chem, has announced that it is joining forces with the Toyota Group to intensify its market strategy for cathode materials. In September 2024, LG Chem signed a supply agreement for cathode active materials (CAM) for electric vehicle batteries with Prime Planet Energy & Solutions (PPES), the battery joint venture between Toyota and Panasonic.

To ensure that battery materials brought into the USA stay in battery loops (and avoid PFE limitations, LG Energy Solution (LGES) and Toyota Tsusho have established a joint venture called Green Metals Battery Innovations for battery recycling in the USA. A pre-processing plant in North Carolina is to be built and is scheduled to go into operation in 2026.

Pakistan, for example, imported more solar panels in that period than the whole African continent.
Tadesse said financial institutions “fixate too much on debt”, with more than 30 African countries in, or at high risk of debt distress, seen as limiting their ability to repay loans.
Africa currently receives just 2% of global clean energy investments, according to the International Energy Agency.
“We need to start to build up capacity within Africa” to boost local demand and bring costs down, she told a discussion at the energy investment report launch.","Leading finance experts at this week’s Africa Climate Summit have called on banks and other financial institutions to take on more risk when considering investments in clean energy projects in Africa to help meet goals to deploy more renewables on the continent and boost green growth.

Speaking at an event on the sidelines of the summit in Addis Ababa, Admassu Tadesse, president of the Eastern and Southern African Trade & Development Bank (TDB), said financial institutions should consider backing projects that would not traditionally have been seen as bankable. A different approach is needed because business as usual “is not going to get us to scale”, he added.

The World Bank estimates that around 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to electricity. To close this gap and increase productivity, African leaders have pledged to deploy 300 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030 as part of the 2023 Nairobi Declaration.

That represents a large jump from the 56 GW recorded in 2022, requiring growth of 23% per year, according to a new report on African renewables investment released at the summit. It notes that since 2022, annual growth has hovered at just above 6%, with more investment still going into fossil fuels.

Another recent report from energy think-tank Ember shows that solar energy is experiencing a boom on the continent, with solar panel imports from China jumping 60% in the year to June 2025, measured by capacity. But Africa’s growth is still lagging behind some other parts of the world. Pakistan, for example, imported more solar panels in that period than the whole African continent.

Tadesse said financial institutions “fixate too much on debt”, with more than 30 African countries in, or at high risk of debt distress, seen as limiting their ability to repay loans. But to get the ball rolling in the region, financial institutions need to take on more risk, he argued, pointing to blended private-public finance as a potential solution, as well as financial guarantees and other instruments to mitigate risk.

“We are taking some very bold decisions now to put that kind of capital up there to support the [project] developers and promoters who are actually taking a lot of risk,” Tadesse said.

Kenya’s Lake Turkana Wind Power Project – which boasts 365 wind turbines with a combined capacity of 310 megawatts – for example, was frozen after early problems caused key investors to pull out. But thanks to the provision of hybrid debt and equity capital from a range of public and private investors, including a €20 million partial risk guarantee from the African Development Bank (AfDB), it managed to get off the ground. Ten years on, it is cited as a successful case study, Tadesse noted.

Attractive projects for investors

Kevin Kariuki, vice president for power, energy, climate and green growth at the AfDB, said that while derisking is important to expand energy access in Africa, countries still need to develop well-structured projects that can draw in investors.

“A reformed sector plus capital equals well-structured projects,” Kariuki told an event to launch the renewables investment report, adding that to attract private finance, countries need to “make good policies – then investors can start looking at Africa as a viable investment destination”.

China on course to peak fossil fuel power as soon as this year, reports say

The AfDB’s Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa seeks to raise $500 million in blended finance capital for bankable projects on the continent, with the AfDB providing resources for project preparation and development, Kariuki said.

Africa currently receives just 2% of global clean energy investments, according to the International Energy Agency. This is as a result of uncertainties and perceived high risks, including political and regulatory instabilities as well as economic volatility.

Citing successful projects – including the Turkana wind farm, Africa’s largest, and Morocco’s utility-scale solar farm – the new investment report shows how they benefited from blended finance and public-private partnerships. African governments need to prepare the ground for increased capital inflows by reducing financial risk and strengthening domestic policy and institutional frameworks, it adds.

Wangari Muchiri, director for Africa at the Global Wind Energy Council, said policies are central to attracting investments and African countries should make sure they are “clear, predictable, and easy to understand to give investors confidence to bring in large capital into the continent”.

At climate summit, African leaders call for a bigger role in energy transition

Boosting demand in Africa

Muchiri said African countries also need to work to boost demand for renewable energy to crowd in more investment. While Chinese firms want to manufacture in Africa, less than 1% of global demand for clean power equipment comes from Africa, with South Africa accounting for half of that – which acts as a disincentive, she added.

“We need to start to build up capacity within Africa” to boost local demand and bring costs down, she told a discussion at the energy investment report launch.

Elsewhere, at a side event on Mission 300, an initiative to provide electricity access to 300 million Africans by 2030, William Asiko, vice president for Africa at The Rockefeller Foundation, pointed to how cellphone companies had taken on investment risk by setting up communications towers to commercialise the sector, making it investable. “How can we do that with [power] transmission lines?” he asked.

He said that while individual consumers will not meet the needs of the cost of putting electricity grid infrastructure in place as with the telecoms industry, the Africa Green Industrialisation Initiative – a continent-wide programme aimed at growing clean energy investment and green industry hubs – “can be a big demand driver for Mission 300 and help bring down the cost of putting up the infrastructure”.

Second Africa Climate Summit seeks to jump hurdles to green industrialisation

Africa’s potential has to be packaged properly to demonstrate the competitive price advantage of manufacturing on the continent using clean energy, Asiko said.

Philanthropy, he added, can play a part “in terms of thinking about innovative finance, bringing companies together to talk about what the opportunities are [and] hosting road shows so that countries that now have low-carbon electricity production can take advantage of attracting some of these”.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/KENYA-WIND-ENERGY-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:58:52.776201

Koloma, a natural hydrogen company that does business in Idaho as Cascade Exploration, is looking for naturally occurring underground hydrogen gas in Canyon County. It has submitted applications for two test wells near Notus, one of which has been endorsed for approval by the Idaho Department of Lands.

If approved, the permits would allow the company to analyze the subsurface with sonic waves and drilling. The company has yet to disclose financial details of the projects, and so far has requested drilling on small footprints totaling 280 acres.

Underground hydrogen was discovered by chance when crews were digging a well in Mali in the 1980s, according to reporting from Science. Kristen Delano, a spokesperson for Koloma, told the Idaho Statesman in an interview that the discovery shocked scientists, many of whom thought hydrogen molecules were too small to collect underground.

“Scientists flocked from all over the world and studied it for about a decade, and it completely flipped science on its head,” Delano said.

An oil and gas businessman began exploring the well as an energy source in 2007, according to Science. Proponents say it could be a breakthrough renewable energy source that replaces carbon-based energy for uses like aviation fuel, manufacturing, and energy production and storage.

Koloma Senior Regulatory & Permitting Coordinator Lauren Morahan told the Idaho Oil and Gas Commission during an informational presentation in August that southwest Idaho could be an ideal spot to search for hydrogen because of the presence of basalt, a volcanic rock that’s common on the landscape.

The type of hydrogen the company is searching for is created by water that seeps through the earth’s surface or rises through the core and interacts with iron-rich rock – like basalt – underground, creating gas that collects there. Unlike carbon-based energy sources, hydrogen regenerates much more quickly.

The industry is still in its infancy. Right now, the well in Mali remains the only viable hydrogen well in the world. Koloma is backed by investors like Amazon, United Airlines and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures and has about $400 million in fundraising, according to financial reports. It’s currently also looking for hydrogen in Kansas and Iowa.

Delano said the search for hydrogen is “the new gold rush.”

“Everybody is after what we would call a ‘commercially viable well,’ so can we find the resource in a large enough quantity to where we could actually bring it to market and put it to use,” Delano said.

Delano said hydrogen drilling rigs look similar to oil and gas drilling equipment, but she and Morahan noted that there is no horizontal drilling or fracking – fracturing rock by injecting high-pressure fluids – involved in their process.

Morahan told commissioners that it could take years for the company to do tests, deal with regulations and move forward with more development.

“We are truly in exploration mode,” she said. “We are where oil and gas was a century ago.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-09-10 09:58:59.726323

Indiana is well suited for carbon sequestration because it holds large areas of subsurface strata, in particular the Mt.
The area to which injected carbon dioxide migrates over time is known as a plume.
Like other real estate, pore space rights may be acquired by purchase, lease or easement.
Indiana’s carbon sequestration statute Indiana’s carbon sequestration framework, codified chiefly in Indiana Code Article 14-39, represents one of the more fully developed state regimes for reconciling traditional property concepts with the emerging needs of large-scale geologic carbon dioxide storage.","Carbon capture and sequestration, commonly referred to as CCS, is relatively new to Indiana.

Carbon dioxide is captured at an industrial site, compressed to a supercritical form, and transported by pipeline to an injection well where it is permanently sequestered in deep underground rock. The transportation and sequestration parts of CCS rely on real estate rights and therefore many Indiana attorneys will be asked to represent clients impacted by it.

Facilities that process corn to make ethanol for blending into vehicle fuel are a common industry looking to utilize CCS. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that ethanol production significantly increases the price of corn, a leading Indiana agricultural product.

Indiana is well suited for carbon sequestration because it holds large areas of subsurface strata, in particular the Mt. Simon formation, which has characteristics desirable for sequestration. It is very deep, well below the formations for oil and gas production in Indiana, has impermeable caprock above it, and has excellent porosity and permeability, characteristics of stone that allow it to accept and hold carbon dioxide.

The carbon dioxide is pumped under high pressure into the microscopic voids in the rock—pore space —where it is irretrievable and eventually becomes a carbonate solid.

The area to which injected carbon dioxide migrates over time is known as a plume. After over a century of experience with oilfield water flooding and other injection-induced oil recovery, geologists are surprisingly good at predicting the plume, thus identifying the area where pore space rights must be acquired by the CCS developer.

Like other real estate, pore space rights may be acquired by purchase, lease or easement. Each method has particular attributes but leasing the pore space is currently the most common.

Due to the CCS process and regulations pertaining to it, a pore space lease has many characteristics not often seen in commercial real estate leases. For example, since a CCS developer cannot put a CCS permit, known as an EPA Class VI Injection Well Permit, into operation without long-term, pore space rights, and since CCS regulations require 50-year post injection monitoring (40 CFR §146.93(b)(1)), the leases are typically non-cancellable for any reason.

Indiana’s carbon sequestration statute

Indiana’s carbon sequestration framework, codified chiefly in Indiana Code Article 14-39, represents one of the more fully developed state regimes for reconciling traditional property concepts with the emerging needs of large-scale geologic carbon dioxide storage.

At the center of the statute is a bright-line rule that pore space belongs to the surface owner unless expressly severed from the surface in a recorded instrument. By vesting ownership of pore space in the surface estate (§14-39-2-3), the General Assembly eliminated the uncertainty that can arise where mineral rights have been severed, thereby allowing project developers to concentrate negotiations on a single class of interest holders rather than litigating whether the mineral estate or the surface estate controls storage rights.

The statute overlays a pragmatic, oil-and-gas-style “unitization” mechanism that allows a developer holding voluntary agreements from owners of at least 70 percent of the projected plume to petition the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to integrate the remaining interests (§14-39-2-4).

To obtain a unitization order, the developer must (1) secure a final Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI permit, (2) demonstrate a good-faith effort to contract with every pore-space owner inside the project boundary, and (3) ensure that non-consenting owners receive equitable economic value.

Requiring a completed Class VI permit as a condition precedent ensures that only technically and environmentally sound projects can invoke compulsory integration, while the 70 percent threshold balances private property autonomy against the practical necessity of assembling contiguous storage reservoirs large enough to be commercially and geologically viable.

Critically, the Legislature insulated both surface and mineral owners from unintended encroachments. A unitization order does not confer a right of surface use unless expressly authorized in the DNR’s integration order, thereby preserving the traditional trespass protections enjoyed by landowners (§14-39-2-4(d)). Moreover, all rights under Chapter 14-39 are expressly subordinate to oil, gas, and coal interests (§14-39-2-1).

This subordination clause ensures that ongoing or future extraction of hydrocarbons and coal will not be impaired except to the limited extent “strictly necessary” to construct and maintain a permanent carbon dioxide storage facility.

Taken together, Indiana’s approach supplies the three ingredients most often cited as prerequisites for a durable sequestration legal regime: clear title to the storage medium, a workable mechanism for assembling large subsurface tracts without excessive hold-out risk, and explicit safeguards for competing resource interests.

By streamlining pore-space aggregation while embedding robust protections for surface and mineral estates, the statute aims to encourage private investment in geologic carbon sequestration, advance state-level decarbonization goals, and position Indiana as a jurisdiction where carbon capture projects can move from concept to injection with fewer legal unknowns.

The Indiana Legislature has also provided CCS developers with the power of condemnation for carbon dioxide pipeline rights-of-way via eminent domain where the CCS developer and landowners are unable to agree on a pipeline easement (Ind. Code § 14-39-1-9). Various regulations providing robust protection for landowners are now pending.

Conclusion

With the Indiana Legislature’s clear nod of support for the CCS industry through the adoption of Ind. Code § 14-39 et al., and the Indiana Natural Resources Commission’s recent adoption of regulations for the underground storage of carbon dioxide, Indiana is well-positioned to become a leader in an emerging industry that not only reduces carbon emissions, but creates new well-paying jobs for Hoosiers and provides landowners with a previously unknown asset.•

Los Angeles, California–(September 10, 2025) – Eco Wave Power (NASDAQ: WAVE), a global leader in onshore wave energy technology, has achieved a major breakthrough for renewable energy in the United States: the successful launch of its first U.S. wave energy project at the Port of Los Angeles, developed in collaboration with AltaSea and Shell Marine Renewable Energy (MRE).

This historic project marks the first onshore wave energy installation in the U.S., showcasing Eco Wave Power’s patented, award-winning technology and setting the stage for large-scale wave energy deployment along America’s coastlines and worldwide.

The demonstration site features floaters, which capture the motion of ocean waves to generate renewable electricity – proving the technology’s potential to deliver reliable and clean power. While still in demonstration mode, this project provides a key foundation for commercial-scale operations, positioning Eco Wave Power as the frontrunner in the emerging U.S. wave energy sector.

The launch comes at a pivotal time for California, aligning with the state’s bold climate policies and Senate Bill 605, which calls for the creation of a comprehensive wave energy roadmap. Federal support is also growing, led by Congresswoman Nanette Díaz Barragán, who recently introduced the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act, a $1 billion initiative to scale marine energy across the nation.

Giving opening remarks, Congresswoman Nanette Díaz Barragán stated:

“Eco Wave Power made history by deploying its innovative wave energy technology into U.S. waters for the very first time. This milestone shows incredible potential for wave energy to power our communities with clean, renewable electricity, while creating jobs and protecting our environment. I am proud to support Eco Wave Power and to lead the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act in Congress, so we can accelerate wave energy development across the country. Congratulations to Eco Wave Power on this groundbreaking achievement!”

Inna Braverman, Founder and CEO of Eco Wave Power, emphasized the importance of this moment:

“California has been a pioneer for climate policy, and we are proud to see wave energy included in Senate Bill 605, calling for a full roadmap for wave energy in California. At the federal level, we applaud the leadership of Congresswoman Barragán for introducing the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act, a $1 billion initiative to scale marine energy nationwide. This project shows that with the right policy, we can turn innovation into reality. And we’re just getting started.

Today, I’m excited to announce that our next projects are already being prepared in Taiwan, India, and Portugal. Wave energy has enormous potential – it is predictable, reliable, and available right here on our coastlines. With projects like this, we are proving that wave energy is not just the future – it is here, now. So, let’s celebrate this milestone together. Because today, we are not just cutting a ribbon – we are opening the door to a new era of clean energy for California and for the world.”

Terry Tamminen, President and CEO of AltaSea said: “AltaSea is a blue economy. We support researchers that are creating intellectual property, like Eco Wave Power, to make sure that they can scale up these technologies and make them practical and successful all over the world. Eco Wave Power is one of those exciting technologies that is ready to scale. It’s already around the world, and it’s only going to get bigger because it has solved many of the problems that other technologies has come up against, for harnessing something as challenging as wave energy. It takes a real clever technology, and I want to say genius, to be able to figure this out.”

Michael J. Galvin, Director of Waterfront and Commercial Real Estate at the Port of Los Angeles, emphasized the local significance:

“The San Pedro Bay Port Complex has big goals to get to zero emissions in the next decade. We can only do this with significantly scaled-up local energy generation. Projects like this are super important to get us there. We can’t do it without localized energy sources, and this project provides us the ability to get there – to make this port the cleanest it can be. That’s a critical component of the port’s goals over the next decade.

We really applaud AltaSea, and we applaud Eco Wave Power’s adaptive reuse of a very old port structure that is not used for anything else and now will be used to demonstrate how energy can be generated out of the ocean. We are really happy to be using the power of the ocean to continue the efforts here and bring the technologies and solutions that we need at the Port of Los Angeles to get to zero emissions in our port complex.”

Laura Richardson, Member of the Senate, 35th District, California State Legislature, presented a certificate of recognition to Inna Braverman, stating:

“In honor of your Grand Opening Ceremony at AltaSea and in recognition of achieving the first wave power station in the United States, we celebrate your commitment to energy innovation and wish you continued growth and success.”

Tim McOsker, Council Member, 15th District, also presented Eco Wave Power with a certificate, noting:

“On behalf of the City of Los Angeles and the One-Five, congratulations on the grand opening of your first wave power station in the United States! This is a remarkable milestone – not just for your team, but for the future of clean energy. As you expand your groundbreaking technology across the globe, we look forward to seeing the powerful impact you will continue to make in shaping a brighter, greener future.”

The event drew a global audience, with Eco Wave Power’s partners traveling from Taiwan, Africa, and other parts of the world, underscoring the international momentum for wave energy development.

Sandra Lee, speaking on behalf of CY Huang, Chairman of I-Ke, shared details of Eco Wave Power’s upcoming project in Taiwan:

“Taiwan offers a unique combination: a strong wave climate, a sophisticated marine and power-electronics manufacturing base, and one of Asia’s most ambitious net-zero policy commitments by 2050. This makes it an ideal environment for wave energy commercialization. That is why I-KE has completed a detailed feasibility study and is now preparing to launch a pilot at Suao Port, with a roadmap to grow to 400 MW in the near future.

Wave energy also provides reliable, local, and sustainable power for energy-intensive industries, such as data centers, supporting the growing demand for cloud computing and AI-driven services. Just as the LA pilot turns that port into a living laboratory, Suao will become a blueprint for replication across Taiwan’s working harbors – and eventually across the region. From Los Angeles to Suao, we share the same mission: turning the energy of the ocean into dependable, scalable, and bankable power. We look forward to welcoming the EWP team to Taiwan and celebrating the commissioning of our pilot as the next step toward large-scale deployment.”

Wilfred Emmanuel, CEO of Africa Great Future Development, highlighted Africa’s growing role:

“Africa faces critical energy challenges. In South Africa alone, over 80% of electricity is still generated from coal-fired power plants, and communities and industries continue to experience power shortages. At the same time, our continent has tremendous untapped renewable resources. With more than 2,800 kilometers of coastline, South Africa has enormous wave energy potential to diversify the energy mix, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and provide sustainable, reliable electricity to underserved communities and industries.

That is why Africa Great Future Development is proud to partner with Eco Wave Power to conduct a feasibility study for a potential wave energy power station at the Port of Ngqura in the Eastern Cape Province. The port’s deep-water infrastructure and exposure to strong ocean waves make it an ideal location to demonstrate the value of wave energy on the African continent.

To promote this vision, we have plans to expand to other ports in South Africa, and a new location in Kenya is already at an advanced stage. Our collaboration with Eco Wave Power is focused on delivering long-term, practical impact. Wave energy can play a transformative role in Africa’s renewable energy future – supporting economic growth, sustainability, and energy security. Together, we are taking the first steps toward a project that could bring measurable benefits to communities, industries, and the broader energy system.

The global expansion of Eco Wave Power – from Israel to the United States, Portugal, Taiwan, and India – demonstrates that wave energy is ready to move from pilot projects to real-world solutions. Africa is next, and we are proud to be part of this journey.”

The launch generated national media attention, with coverage from Good Morning America, CNN, the Los Angeles Times, and the Associated Press, all highlighting the significance of U.S.-based wave energy deployment and its potential to contribute to California’s clean energy goals.

Expanding clean energy in Illinois This announcement builds on Digital Realty’s first community solar agreement in Illinois, unveiled late last year.
Data centre operations and renewable energy Digital Realty already achieves full renewable matching for electricity used at its 11 data centres across Illinois.
Globally, Digital Realty reports that 75% of the electricity used across its portfolio of more than 300 data centres is matched with renewable energy.
For Digital Realty, community solar projects contribute both to operational decarbonisation and to the wider decarbonisation of power systems.","Digital Realty, a global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data centres, has announced an expansion of its renewable energy commitments in Illinois.

The company has confirmed additional contracts with Soltage, a US-based Independent Power Producer, to deliver a larger portfolio of local community solar projects across the state with a combined expected capacity of 33.5MWdc.

From this portfolio, Digital Realty secures 13.4MWdc of locally sourced solar energy that will feed directly into Illinois power grids and provide benefits to surrounding communities.

The company frames this move as part of its broader strategy to integrate clean power into its data centre operations and to ensure surrounding communities benefit directly.

""We’re proud to deepen our investment in Illinois and advance our mission to be a responsible steward of the environment,” says Aaron Binkley, Vice President of Sustainability at Digital Realty. “By investing in community solar, we’re not only decarbonising our operations, but also supporting clean, reliable power for the communities and regions where we operate.""

Expanding clean energy in Illinois

This announcement builds on Digital Realty’s first community solar agreement in Illinois, unveiled late last year. That earlier project set the foundation for the expansion and confirmed the potential of state-level initiatives to support local grids while offering clean power access to residents.

The extended agreement with Soltage sees a marked increase in capacity and scope, taking the total project pipeline in Illinois to 33.5MWdc.

Digital Realty’s allocated share of 13.4MWdc demonstrates how a major data centre operator can contribute directly to local renewable energy growth, rather than sourcing credits or power from distant regions.

Alongside environmental benefits, these solar projects are designed to create tangible economic value.

Estimates suggest that around 88 local jobs will be generated through the build-out and operation of the projects. Digital Realty emphasises the importance of balancing its operational sustainability goals with community development outcomes, reinforcing its role as both a technology provider and a local partner.

Data centre operations and renewable energy

Digital Realty already achieves full renewable matching for electricity used at its 11 data centres across Illinois. This matching covers both renewable and carbon-free sources, procured within the state and through broader national programmes.

The new projects specifically target Lake, Will and Stephenson counties, increasing the proportion of renewable power that is sourced and consumed within Illinois itself.

Globally, Digital Realty reports that 75% of the electricity used across its portfolio of more than 300 data centres is matched with renewable energy. This makes Illinois a showcase for the company’s integrated approach, combining global commitments with region-specific projects that provide measurable benefits to customers and communities.

Data centres are among the most power-intensive facilities in modern infrastructure, requiring continuous electricity for servers, cooling and connectivity.

Matching these energy needs with renewable sources has become a core priority for operators seeking to balance rising demand for digital services with sustainability obligations.

Digital Realty’s expansion of community solar demonstrates how large-scale facilities can operate in step with state-level renewable initiatives.

A global sustainability strategy

This development aligns with Digital Realty’s wider climate goals. The company has committed to a science-based target of reducing direct emissions from owned operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 68% and reducing emissions linked to its supply chain and customers (Scope 3) by 24% by 2030. These targets reflect the international Science Based Targets initiative, which provides corporate pathways for aligning with global climate objectives.

In April, as grid operators were girding for heat waves, nearly one-third of U.S. power was generated from renewable sources.
But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity.
So-called green energy is currently the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy power generator in the U.S., even without incentives, according to research from Lazard.
“Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”","The Trump administration has been slashing green energy incentives, freezing the construction of wind farms and ordering coal-burning power plants to keep running longer than planned. And yet, more American homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

In June, almost one-quarter of U.S. power generation was green, up from 18% in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The question now is whether the trend continues with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The recent growth in renewables usage is almost certainly tied to investments made prior to Trump’s election in November. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. backed roughly $100 billion of investments in clean energy. Now, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to those efforts by opposing offshore wind farms and eliminating incentives for electric vehicles and solar power.

Still, Texas is a prime example of how the energy markets have changed. In early March, the state’s grid set a record for wind generation; in mid-June, it registered a new peak for electricity produced from renewable resources; and a month later, Texas notched new highs for battery storage and solar generation.

Similar records are popping up across the country on an almost weekly basis, as utilities harvest a windfall from new solar and wind farms that can be built faster and more affordably than fossil fuel-based power plants.

For utilities and folks operating the nation’s power grids, the wave of green energy couldn’t come at a better time because volatile weather, electric vehicles and a rash of AI-focused data centers are all driving up demand.

In April, as grid operators were girding for heat waves, nearly one-third of U.S. power was generated from renewable sources. And the green energy boom is spreading beyond the sun and wind belts. The New York grid hit a renewable record on June 24. New England recorded new highs for both wind and solar power this summer and the grid in the Mid-Atlantic states reported a record renewable harvest in late June.

“We’re in an entirely new landscape for load growth, so this is none too soon,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility policy director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Every solution available will need to be called on.”

If all of the utility-owned solar panels in California were considered one facility, it would have ranked at the end of July as the second-largest power plant in the world. At noon on July 30, solar generation on the state’s CAISO grid hit 21.7 megawatts, second only to the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam on China’s Yangtze River.

For much of that day, the sun accounted for roughly two-thirds of the power Californians were using and the panels fed into batteries that, once the sun went down, juiced nearly one-third of the state.

The Texas power market is truly the Wild West of electricity.

As a deregulated, wholesale market, the state’s consumers can choose their provider and plants are only paid for what they produce. In this eat-what-you-kill energy world, utilities have turned en masse to a novel tool: big batteries.

These so-called storage facilities let power players sock away electrons when demand (read: prices) are low and discharge the juice when usage peaks. Often, the most economical strategy is storing solar power during the day and releasing it in the evening when the lights and TVs switch on and air conditioners are still humming.

A rash of new storage facilities have been switched on in Texas this year, shoring up the grid with record amounts of reserve power.

In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the U.S., it’s common for tractor trailers to get blown over onto their sides. Such is the power of the wind on the Great Plains. And it’s steady as well as strong.

On the Southwest Power Pool grid, which stretches from the Dakotas south to Texas, new records for wind power were reached twice in August alone. At one point on Aug. 16, almost two of every three electrons in the system were coming from turbines.

Good, cheap or fast? Typically, one only gets to choose two of those things. But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity. So-called green energy is currently the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy power generator in the U.S., even without incentives, according to research from Lazard.

Given President Donald Trump’s attacks on green power, the decisions made by utilities have become more fraught than usual and a bit more complicated than just choosing the cheapest plant to build. In May, Gordon van Welie, chief executive officer of the ISO New England grid, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that his organization was counting on large quantities of offshore wind to meet rising demand. Three months later, the Trump administration ordered crews to stop working on a project off the coast of Rhode Island where 45 of 65 planned turbines have already been installed, a directive that it now has to defend in court.

The facility was expected to power roughly 350,000 homes. Administration officials say solar and wind is unreliable and too connected to China-based supply chains. Trump’s term, however, will likely be over long before any new coal-fired or nuclear plant can be built to replace that capacity.

“We need more electrons in this country and the industry seems to have an agnostic view,” said Lazard Managing Director Samuel Scroggins, referring to where electrons originate. “Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86c215f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5816x3053+0+174/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F97%2Feaadb521422cb66cc2a05a883da6%2F1509363-me-iconic-places-wind-farm-3-gmf.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:02:07.389271

Federal Rollbacks Challenge Wind and Solar

For example, EPA moved to suspend a Biden-era requirement for oil and gas operations to plug methane leaks, but meanwhile, nine states are working on policies to require capturing and using more methane from landfills, including a draft Colorado rule on which hearings were held in late August. Capturing more landfill methane has the potential to cut US emissions and boost renewables significantly, even as other forms of GHG reduction and clean energy get rolled back.

President Trump has signaled animosity for renewables, vowing no windmills will be built and issuing an executive order ending “so-called ‘green’ subsidies” for “expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” claiming they “threaten national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries.”

Trump’s FY26 budget phases out Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar within one year. That could prevent half of planned new wind and solar capacity from coming online over the next decade. Without the credits, only about 30% of planned solar and 57% of planned wind projects will be able to compete. Meanwhile, an Interior Department directive requires Secretary Doug Burgum to personally sign off on any solar and wind permitting on federal lands to “level the playing field for oil and gas.” That could take hundreds of millions of sun-drenched, windswept acres off the table for renewables development.

Where Renewables Still Compete

In such a policy environment, renewables projects can’t rely on federal subsidies and need a compelling business case. At the same time, while the budget law rapidly sunsets IRA tax credits for intermittent renewables like wind and solar, it preserves them for other baseload renewables, including hydroelectric dams, geothermal plants, and battery storage, and extends the 45Z Clean Fuels Production tax credit through 2029. This technology-neutral credit for low-emissions transportation fuels helps incentivize a growing market for biomethane/renewable natural gas (RNG), among other fuels.

Methane Capture and RNG’s Untapped Potential

RNG, like fossil natural gas, is almost pure methane, which is at least 86 times more powerful a warming agent than carbon dioxide over 20 years. Methane has already caused a third of modern global warming and counting, so cutting it is key to slowing near-term temperature rise.

70% of the methane in US RNG comes from landfills, the third largest methane emitter after the agriculture and energy sectors. Recent satellite data shows methane emissions from landfills were previously underestimated by as much as 50%. Tightening up on these emissions is a cost-effective way to abate methane, and there is a strong business case for it, because landfills already supply most of the feedstock for the RNG market, and could supply a lot more.

Advanced Landfill Tech Strengthens the Business Case

Advanced landfill technologies (ALT) such as real-time monitoring and control systems make compliance with proposed stricter landfill rules much easier. The rules don’t mandate ALT systems, but they effectively encourage them. ALT systems automate what would otherwise be labor-intensive monitoring and reporting, and boost quantity and quality of captured methane, raising it well above the threshold where landfill RNG operations become profitable.

For example, across a portfolio of ten landfills using LoCI Controls’ ALT systems, gas collection increased 17%. In one case, it increased 32%, generating an additional $3.8 million in gross annual revenue. This suggests a huge opportunity for landfills to adopt ALT and become engines of renewable energy and methane abatement, and for landfill operators to make good money doing it, even in the current policy environment.

Nationwide Impact and Market Growth

A new Energy Vision report studies the potential of advanced landfill tech, including earlier installation of gas collection and control systems (GCCS). It found that deploying them at high-emitting landfills (nearly 900 landfills nationwide are clear candidates, while another 140 could be considered “stretch goals”) could cut US methane emissions 7.2-8.6% (49.4-59.2 million MT CO2e), for just $8.35-9.58 per MT. Compare that to plugging methane leaks in low-output oil and gas “stripper wells,” which costs approximately $19 per MT.

The study found that if the 900 best candidate landfills adopted ALT, they’d capture enough methane to produce an additional 93 million MMBTU of RNG each year, boosting RNG production (135 million MMBTU in 2024) by nearly 70%. Selling this RNG would enable landfill operators to recoup their investment fast and generate $1.86 billion a year industry-wide.

So although the era of federal policy support for wind and solar may be ending, there are still big, untapped opportunities for competitive projects and creative approaches like advanced landfill tech that can deliver cost-effective GHG reductions and renewable energy generation. State policies can lower barriers to entry and help drive them forward, but fundamentally, it’s their strong business case and their ability to make money for investors that will allow them to scale.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250907-144655-5d2-Michael%20Lerner.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 09:59:20.277047

For example, Massachusetts’ Solar Renewable Target (SMART) program adjusts incentive levels based on installation pricing and electricity savings. As electricity prices rose in recent years, the SMART II program stopped paying incentives in some regions. The updated SMART III program has since increased incentives to reflect higher solar costs, including tariffs and interconnection fees.

In Illinois, attorney Michael R. Strong of Fox, Swibel, Levin & Carroll, LLP filed a “Verified Emergency Petition” requesting the reopening of the Illinois Power Agency’s (IPA) 2024 Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan. The filing includes a schedule of recommended actions.

The petition was filed on behalf of the Solar Energy Industries Association, the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the Illinois Solar Energy Association, and Advanced Energy United. It argues that the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act’s clean energy goals risk being undermined by the new federal legislation, and urges the Commission to act quickly to preserve Illinois’ solar momentum.

The filing contends that Illinois has a chance to take “strong and decisive action in the face of hostile legislation at the federal level.” It cites the Illinois Power Agency’s June 2025 draft of the Adjustable Block Program CREST model, which states:

While the ITC tax credit value for a particular system is based on federal law regarding what may be in the tax basis, the Adjustable Block Program CREST model for 2025-26 that the IPA put out for public comment calculates approximately $1.1 million in ITC value for a project with approximately $6.1 million in installed costs and nearly $2.5 million in ITC value for a project with approximately $13.75 million in installed costs (2.0 MWac and 5.0 MWac systems, respectively).

Strong noted that the CREST models show the ITC portion of a project’s cost stack is substantial relative to development and installation costs. The filing goes on to state that the state’s primary support mechanism, the Renewable Energy Credit (REC) program, is “specifically calibrated to set REC prices based on the difference between the IPA’s assessment of typical costs and revenues.”

The petition proposes six actions, summarized as follows:

Expand Adjustable Block Program (ABP)

Add up to 100% of current program size.

EEC Block expansion: +64 MW (Group A), +169 MW (Group B).

Effective upon Final Order on Reopening.

Pull forward Solar for All funds

Up to $20M from Renewable Energy Resources Fund.

For subprograms that allow ITC monetization.

Reallocate unused ABP capacity

On April 1, 2026, reallocate 50% of unused capacity.

Apply to waitlisted projects per LTRRPP §7.3.4.

Adjust competitive REC procurements

Allow solar–wind split flexibility.

Fill shortfalls with cost-effective bids from other categories.

Expand and retime large-scale procurements

Utility-scale and brownfield REC procurements.

Expanded capacity, results required before May 1, 2026.

Update REC contract language

Amend standard and existing REC contracts.

Address risks from the Federal Act, including Summer 2025 procurements.

The petition also notes that Equity Eligible Contractors may propose an adder to REC contracts, and specifies that brownfield REC procurements should be limited to sites regulated under EPA or Illinois remediation programs.

But to reach that conclusion, the agency skipped basic practices it routinely uses when projecting the effects of new regulations. It did not do any new modeling that would have informed its projections about how repealing the rules would impact the economy, pollution levels, public health and employment, according to environmental advocates and former EPA officials.

Instead, the agency made the case in its written analysis that the nation would be enriched by the administration’s moves to cancel the regulations — the opposite finding of the Biden EPA, which estimated that the rules would lower climate pollution, reduce illness and prevent premature deaths among Americans.

The Trump administration’s conclusions can be hard to square.

In one section of the so-called regulatory impact analysis, EPA concedes that the rollback and other Trump policies would lead to slightly higher gasoline prices. But then it concludes that the cost of gas would actually be $1 lower compared to Biden-era projections. The agency, which didn’t provide data showing how it arrived at that number, argued that President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” policies would reduce costs.

“It’s a lot of funny math,” said Kathy Harris, director of the clean vehicles program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It is sometimes migraine-inducing trying to understand some of the circular logic they’re using behind some of these justifications.”

Congress required agencies to weigh the costs and benefits of major new regulations. EPA’s regulatory impact analysis, or RIA, fulfills that obligation by showing the impacts of its July proposal to jettison the endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions and climate standards for cars and trucks.

The two repeals are possibly the most consequential climate policy EPA has undertaken. The scientific finding has made Clean Air Act climate rules legally possible for 16 years. The Biden-era tailpipe rules curb carbon from the highest-emitting sector of the U.S. economy: motor vehicles.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the package the “largest deregulatory action” in the agency’s history when he rolled it out this summer at a truck dealership in Indiana.

EPA claims the dual proposal would save the U.S. economy up to $444 billion annually through 2055, overwhelming the $5 billion to $8 billion in losses it projects would occur from rolling back the rules, like increased car congestion and additional particulate pollution.

These analyses typically span hundreds of pages and contain new modeling to show how a proposed action would change the U.S. economy, pollution levels, public health and other factors.

But the analysis for EPA’s draft repeal of the endangerment finding and the climate rules for vehicles is just 63 pages. Altogether, the RIA is about 3.5 percent as long as the Biden EPA’s two regulatory analyses for the tailpipe emissions rules for passenger vehicles and long-haul trucks.

Trump’s EPA borrows from the Biden-era modeling outputs and then tweaks them to reflect new assumptions about its own proposal.

“They basically just flip the columns so that costs are now benefits, and benefits are now costs,” said James Goodwin, policy director for the Center for Progressive Reform.

“What this analysis is focused on is taking apart the original numbers for the 2024 cost-benefit analysis to try to make that [Biden-era] rule look like it had negative net costs, so that its rescission would then have net benefits,” he added.

The document owes its staggeringly low page count to conspicuous omissions. It doesn’t include analyses for a wide range of factors that past administrations have modeled and analyzed as a matter of course.

It’s unclear whether that will change before the proposal becomes final — which EPA says it aims to do by the end of this year. The agency is taking public comment now.

When finalized, the repeal of the car rules and endangerment finding are likely to be litigated, and some attorneys say a slim regulatory analysis could be a liability for the Trump administration.

“I think it’s a huge risk,” said Jason Schwartz, legal director at the Institute for Policy Integrity. “A document like this makes it so clear that they have not done the work in thinking through the actual effects of their deregulation, and that is legally required.”

EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran responded to queries from POLITICO’S E&E News by pointing to language in the draft rule asserting that “EPA has not relied upon any aspect of the draft RIA as justification for this proposed rulemaking.”

Not much climate change

The analysis covers proposals to repeal both the endangerment finding and standards for carbon emissions from light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. But it doesn’t say anything about the potential impact of removing the endangerment finding, which has been used to justify numerous climate regulations, including carbon standards for power generation and oil and gas development.

That’s not unprecedented. The Obama EPA didn’t analyze the costs and benefits of the rules that could follow from the original finding, arguing that the Clean Air Act directed the agency to make the determination on the basis of science alone. Regulatory costs and benefits would be weighed later as rules were proposed.

Holran, the EPA spokesperson, pointed to the Obama-era precedent to explain why the agency didn’t analyze costs and benefits when proposing to repeal the endangerment finding. But one of the Trump administration’s chief criticisms of the finding has been that the Obama-era EPA failed to do just that.

“The EPA has never meaningfully considered or invited public comment on the cost, effectiveness, and continued propriety of its [greenhouse gas] regulatory program,” EPA argued in its July repeal proposal. “We propose that these considerations should have been taken into account when the 2009 endangerment finding intentionally triggered a ‘duty to regulate’ vehicle emissions.”

Repealing the finding would take EPA out of the game of regulating climate pollution permanently, except in a handful of instances where Congress has given EPA explicit directions to do so, such as phasing out climate-forcing refrigerants.

If the Obama EPA should have considered the societal impacts of regulations that stemmed from the 2009 endangerment finding, some experts say, the Trump administration should have done the same for their removal.

“It’s notable that they didn’t really follow their own advice here,” said Schwartz of the Institute for Policy Integrity.

The document also ignores the climate impacts of scrapping greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks. That’s a departure from the first Trump administration, during which EPA applied a greatly-reduced “social cost of carbon” as a metric for climate damages.

It’s also different from what EPA did in its June draft repealing the greenhouse gas standards on power plants. In that proposal, EPA grappled with the climate impact of scrapping the standards, if only to conclude the effect would be limited.

Its new analysis for the endangerment finding mentions “climate” only six times. In two of those instances, it appears as part of the name of the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard University, whose research EPA cites.

“They’re repealing rules relating to greenhouse gases, and there is barely a mention of climate at all,” said Schwartz.

EPA didn’t monetize the societal benefits of avoiding climate change. But it asserts that “any reliable estimate of that value would be orders of magnitude less than the benefits of the proposed action.”

The Trump administration’s analysis effectively values the harm of climate change at zero. The Biden EPA estimated that its rules for light- and medium-duty vehicles, finalized last year, would have delivered $150 billion in annual benefits from avoided warming through 2055.

Omitted impacts on pollution and health

EPA’s analysis also sharply reduces estimates for the health impacts of lowering particulate matter — a toxic form of pollution that’s linked to respiratory and pulmonary disease and death.

The Biden-era rule for light- and medium-duty vehicles showed $10 billion in annualized health benefits from reductions in particulate pollution averaged over the life of the rule. The repeal’s analysis lowers that to between $2 billion and $4 billion annually, arguing that the Biden administration underestimated “emissions offsets” associated with electric vehicles. That includes increased fossil-fuel-based power that it said would be needed to power an electric vehicle fleet.

EPA also noted that its proposal would leave standards in place for non-climate pollutants — called “criteria pollutants” — that cause smog and soot.

Undoing the vehicle rules for carbon could result in “incidental” increases in fossil fuels costs of between $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion annually through 2055 compared with the Biden-era baseline, EPA said.

No modeling

Another departure from past practice is how EPA arrived at the conclusions in its analysis.

“They basically took previous modeling results and then just did some calculations — some rough approximations — without doing any modeling,” said Joshua Linn, an economist at the University of Maryland.

One example is EPA’s conclusions about fuel costs. It assumes that in a scenario where the vehicle rules are repealed diesel and gasoline will cost more in the future than the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected in 2024. It’s the result of Congress curtailing EV tax credits and the loss of California’s clean vehicle standards, not just the repeal of the EPA rules.

But then the agency concludes that gasoline will cost $1 less per gallon than EIA projected in its 2023 outlook — an assertion EPA doesn’t fully explain or provide a citation for.

The lack of new model runs — which typically take months — could mean that EPA isn’t providing reliable projections for technology adoption and other outcomes that would flow from the rule, Linn said.

EPA didn’t respond to questions about why it opted not to do new modeling ahead of releasing the draft. Linn said it might have something to do with EPA’s expedited release of the draft just six months into Trump’s second term.

In other sections, EPA relies on research from academia to support some of its assumptions. For example, it cites an analysis by Linn and other researchers to explain why it chose to count only 2.5 years in cost savings from reduced fuel consumption under the Biden rules. That substantially lowered the financial benefits of the Biden-era standards — and thus the cost of the Trump proposal to repeal them.

But Linn said his research supported EPA counting fuel savings for seven years instead.

“Roughly speaking, using the longer payback period would increase the costs of revoking the standards — that is, forgone fuel cost savings — by a factor of three,” he said.

Elaine Buckberg, who helped write a Salata Institute report that showed how the loss of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits would impact EV adoption and affordability, said EPA’s characterization of that analysis “is, in fact, accurate.”

“Take away policy support for EVs and EV adoption still advances, but not as fast as it would have had the policies remained in place,” she said in an email.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/dc/72/18ff68d34d7e9e1336cee13f8d3c/u-s-congress-53218.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 08:01:32.789090

Basically, under Trump’s bill, wind power developers have until July 2026 to submit applications for projects underway, which must be completed before 2028.
Tax credits have helped build a thriving wind energy industry in Iowa.
So, you’d think Trump’s effort to kneecap the wind energy industry would draw a strong rebuke from Iowa’s congressional delegation.","There is something President Donald Trump despises almost as much as truth, justice and LED light bulbs.

“I hate wind,” Trump told oil and gas industry executives at a fundraiser in April 2024, according to the Washington Post.

“If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75% in value. And they say the noise causes cancer. And of course it’s like a graveyard for birds,” Trump said in 2020. Not to mention wind’s effect on his hair.

Windmill cancer is not really a thing. Also, cats and tall buildings kill far more birds than wind turbines.

Hating wind is one way to show Trump loyalty. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum says offshore wind turbines would disrupt our radar, allowing an undersea drone attack. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. argues that turbines create electromagnetic waves harmful to wildlife and humans.

The Department of Energy recently posted on X that solar and wind are “worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.” Apparently, these experts have never heard of battery storage.

So, in Trump’s Huge Beastly Bulging Bill, there are provisions for shutting down federal tax credits for the construction of wind and solar energy infrastructure. It will slow our march toward a clean energy future. Trump prefers coal.

Under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, wind tax credit availability was extended to 2032. Basically, under Trump’s bill, wind power developers have until July 2026 to submit applications for projects underway, which must be completed before 2028.

“One thing that the big, beautiful Bill has done is it's almost created like a gold rush,” said Steve Guyer, senior energy policy counsel for the Iowa Environmental Council. “As far as wind and solar, you're going to have an awful lot of entities trying to move very quickly, securing contracts, trying to basically move these things forward.”

Eliminating tax credits will not halt wind energy development, it will just make it more expensive. It’s a feature, not a flaw. Utilities will still build wind farms because they need power. But it will cost them more, and who do you think will ultimately pay more? Customers.

Tax credits have helped build a thriving wind energy industry in Iowa. We get roughly 60% of our electric power from the wind. According to Power Up Iowa, $30 billion has been invested in renewable energy in Iowa, 14,500 jobs are supported by clean power and no other state generates as much of its electricity from clean sources.

So, you’d think Trump’s effort to kneecap the wind energy industry would draw a strong rebuke from Iowa’s congressional delegation. Nah.

“This is transformational legislation,” U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who is running for the U.S. Senate and has been endorsed by Trump, told reporters. “ … By advancing smart permitting reform, ensuring tax certainty for energy producers and rejecting harmful mandates, we can and will secure an affordable, reliable American-made energy future.”

Aside from that word salad, Hinson favors an “all of the above” energy strategy.

“Trump's policy is not an all of the above policy,” said Josh Mandelbaum, senior attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center “Trump's policy is actively hostile and trying to put a thumb on the scale against wind. So, if you're in favor of all of the above, you should be speaking up.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright came to Iowa and said wind energy must stand on its own two feet without federal help. Members of Iowa’s congressional delegation meekly agreed. What about tax credits and a federally mandated market for ethanol? No comment.

So, Iowa Republicans are coddling the wind hater in chief at the expense of their own state. It’s almost as if their principles are determined by which way Trump’s hair blows.

“Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.","The Trump administration has been slashing green energy incentives, freezing the construction of wind farms and ordering coal-burning power plants to keep running longer than planned. And yet, more American homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

In June, almost one-quarter of U.S. power generation was green, up from 18% in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The question now is whether the trend continues with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The recent growth in renewables usage is almost certainly tied to investments made prior to Trump’s election in November. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. backed roughly $100 billion of investments in clean energy. Now, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to those efforts by opposing offshore wind farms and eliminating incentives for electric vehicles and solar power.

Still, Texas is a prime example of how the energy markets have changed. In early March, the state’s grid set a record for wind generation; in mid-June, it registered a new peak for electricity produced from renewable resources; and a month later, Texas notched new highs for battery storage and solar generation.

Similar records are popping up across the country on an almost weekly basis, as utilities harvest a windfall from new solar and wind farms that can be built faster and more affordably than fossil fuel-based power plants.

Here are five charts that capture a bit of the size and scope of America’s recent wave of green energy, showing where and how it’s happening, and what the landscape looks like going forward.

Nearly one-third

For utilities and folks operating the nation’s power grids, the wave of green energy couldn’t come at a better time because volatile weather, electric vehicles and a rash of AI-focused data centers are all driving up demand.

In April, as grid operators were girding for heat waves, nearly one-third of U.S. power was generated from renewable sources. And the green energy boom is spreading beyond the Sun and Wind belts. The New York grid hit a renewable record on June 24. New England recorded new highs for both wind and solar power this summer and the grid in the Mid-Atlantic states reported a record renewable harvest in late June.

“We’re in an entirely new landscape for load growth, so this is none too soon,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility policy director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Every solution available will need to be called on.”

What good is the dawn?

If all of the utility-owned solar panels in California were considered one facility, it would have ranked at the end of July as the second-largest power plant in the world. At noon on July 30, solar generation on the state’s CAISO grid hit 21.7 megawatts, second only to the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam on China’s Yangtze River.

For much of that day, the sun accounted for roughly two-thirds of the power Californians were using and the panels fed into batteries that, once the sun went down, juiced nearly one-third of the state.

Charge baby charge

The Texas power market is truly the Wild West of electricity.

As a deregulated, wholesale market, the state’s consumers can choose their provider and plants are only paid for what they produce. In this eat-what-you-kill energy world, utilities have turned en masse to a novel tool: big batteries.

These so-called storage facilities let power players sock away electrons when demand (read: prices) are low and discharge the juice when usage peaks. Often, the most economical strategy is storing solar power during the day and releasing it in the evening when the lights and TVs switch on and air conditioners are still humming.

A rash of new storage facilities have been switched on in Texas this year, shoring up the grid with record amounts of reserve power.

A mighty wind

In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the U.S., it’s common for tractor trailers to get blown over onto their sides. Such is the power of the wind on the Great Plains. And it’s steady as well as strong.

On the Southwest Power Pool grid, which stretches from the Dakotas south to Texas, new records for wind power were reached twice in August alone. At one point on Aug. 16, almost two of every three electrons in the system were coming from turbines.

Clicking the boxes

Good, cheap or fast? Typically, one only gets to choose two of those things. But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity. So-called green energy is currently the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy power generator in the U.S., even without incentives, according to research from Lazard Inc.

Given President Donald Trump’s attacks on green power, the decisions made by utilities have become more fraught than usual and a bit more complicated than just choosing the cheapest plant to build. In May, Gordon van Welie, chief executive officer of the ISO New England grid, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that his organization was counting on large quantities of offshore wind to meet rising demand. Three months later, the Trump administration ordered crews to stop working on a project off the coast of Rhode Island where 45 of 65 planned turbines have already been installed, a directive that it now has to defend in court.

The facility was expected to power roughly 350,000 homes. Administration officials say solar and wind is unreliable and too connected to China-based supply chains. Trump’s term, however, will likely be over long before any new coal-fired or nuclear plant can be built to replace that capacity.

“We need more electrons in this country and the industry seems to have an agnostic view,” said Lazard Managing Director Samuel Scroggins, referring to where electrons originate. “Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”

However, the president's sweeping January executive order geared toward ""unleashing American energy"" named hydropower as a potential future source of domestic energy, and wave energy proponents are hoping that includes them.
Recent state legislation, Senate Bill 605, directs California to create a comprehensive roadmap for wave energy.","Along a rocky wharf at the Port of Los Angeles on Tuesday, seven blue steel structures bobbed in the gentle wake of a Catalina Island ferry. The bouncing floaters marked a moment for clean energy — the first onshore wave power project in the country.

The floaters belong to Eco Wave Power, a Swedish company behind the pilot project located at AltaSea, a nonprofit ocean institute at the port. They harness the natural rise and fall of the ocean to create clean electricity 24 hours a day.

The pilot project will generate a modest 100 kilowatts of power — enough for about 100 homes — but company officials said the ultimate goal is to install steel floaters along the port's 8-mile breakwater to generate about 60 megawatts of power, or enough for about 60,000 homes.

Such an achievement could be replicated along other parts of the U.S. coastline, according to Inna Braverman, Eco Wave Power's co-founder and chief executive. She noted that the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that wave power has the potential to provide more than 60% of the country's energy needs.

""This pilot is more than a project — it's a milestone,"" Braverman said. ""It shows that wave energy can be deployed right here, along existing port infrastructure, without harming the ocean, without taking up valuable space and in a scalable way.""

The technology uses the bobbing floaters to compress pistons, which push hydraulic fluid into storage tanks located nearby on land. As the pressure increases inside the tanks, it spins a motor, which turns a generator that makes clean electricity.

This is different from wave technology offshore, which can be more expensive to install, harder to repair and more difficult to connect to a grid because it's farther from land, Braverman said. Capturing the energy at the shore enables Eco Wave Power to keep the ""expensive parts"" on dry land and avoid disturbing the seabed or marine environment.

And unlike other renewables such as wind and solar power, which cannot produce electricity around the clock unless accompanied by batteries, wave energy is 24/7.

The two-year pilot at the Port of L.A. is one of several efforts from Eco Wave Power, which is also pursuing projects in Taiwan, India, Portugal and New Jersey, and already has connected a wave energy project to the grid in Israel. Its total project pipeline is more than 404 megawatts.

""I think what they're doing is an incredibly important stepping stone toward a proper full-scale deployment in the ocean,"" said Bryson Robertson, director of the Pacific Marine Energy Center and a professor at Oregon State University, who is not involved with the project.

""Any time people are testing and developing novel technologies — particularly those that harness the renewable power of the ocean — that's a fantastic situation,"" Robertson said. ""I think it's great to see this technology move forward.""

Indeed, the pilot could help the city and state reach their ambitious climate goals, including L.A.'s plan to reach 100% clean energy in L.A. by 2035, and California's plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2045.

It could also help clean up the port, which has long struggled with pollution issues linked to ship engines, diesel trucks and other freight equipment that spews particulate matter into the air. Communities near the port, such as Wilmington and Carson, suffer from some of the worst air in the area.

Projects like Eco Wave Power are ""critical for us in our long-term strategy to become the first zero-emission port complex in the world,"" said Michael Galvin, the port's director of waterfront and commercial real estate. The complex, which includes the Port of L.A. and the adjoining Port of Long Beach, aims to convert all cargo-handling equipment to zero emissions by 2030, and all short-haul trucks to zero emissions by 2035.

Scaling onshore wave energy is not without challenges, however. While the U.S. has a lot of potential, the country's entire coastline would never be covered in wave energy devices, Robertson said.

Instead, researchers are studying the best ways to deploy the technology, including taking advantage of existing infrastructure, as Eco Wave Power has done. The wharf at AltaSea had not been used in about 20 years.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been slashing federal funding for renewable energy projects, including wind and solar, while clearing the path for fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. However, the president's sweeping January executive order geared toward ""unleashing American energy"" named hydropower as a potential future source of domestic energy, and wave energy proponents are hoping that includes them.

""No country in the world owns the marine energy sector,"" Robertson said. ""The U.S. still has a very unique opportunity to be a global leader in this sector and sell that technology to the rest of the world.""

The pilot project at AltaSea cost less than $1 million, about half of which was funded by Eco Wave Power and half by the oil and gas company Shell, according to Braverman, the chief executive. She said the company recently did a feasibility study and identified an initial 77 sites in the U.S. that would be suitable for the commercial wave energy.

At scale, she said the cost is comparable to onshore wind, and less than offshore wind.

Many of the biggest barriers for wave energy so far have been logistical, including a lack of regulatory framework and licensing pathways. The project at AltaSea needed licenses from the Port of L.A. and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which took about two years, she said.

Key Highlights

The collaborative fast charging network now includes over 200 locations nationwide.

Drivers have access to approximately 850 new EV fast charging stalls.

The network has expanded its reach to nearly 40 states.

The partnership between Pilot, GM, and EVgo aims to enable coast-to-coast EV travel.

The ultimate goal is to build up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at 500 Pilot and Flying J locations.

Expanding National EV Infrastructure

In just over two years, the partnership has worked to bridge charging gaps along essential travel routes. The network’s growth has been rapid, expanding from just over 25 states to nearly 40 in less than a year. This effort specifically addresses the need for charging infrastructure in less-populated areas, noting that only 45% of rural counties had at least one fast charging stall at the start of 2025.

Some of the newest states to join the network include Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Significant expansion has also occurred across Texas, Missouri, and Florida. The strategic placement of these chargers along interstate corridors carries more than 20 percent of the total traffic in the U.S., directly supporting drivers on the nation’s busiest highways.

Enhancing the Driver Experience

The charging stations are designed to offer a seamless and convenient experience for EV drivers. Located at Pilot and Flying J travel centers, the sites provide access to a wide array of amenities, including free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurants, and convenience items. The chargers themselves are EVgo’s 350kW fast-chargers, capable of quickly refilling an EV’s range to get drivers back on their journey.

Many locations feature overhead canopies to protect drivers from the elements, and several include pull-through stalls that allow vehicles towing trailers to charge easily. To further streamline the process, the Plug and Charge feature is available throughout the network. This technology allows drivers with compatible EV models to automatically initiate and pay for a charging session simply by plugging in their vehicle. According to Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy, this collaboration helps ensure that charging access does not get in the way of an EV journey.

A Collaborative Vision for Future Travel

First announced in 2022, the collaboration between Pilot, General Motors, and EVgo is nearly halfway to its goal of installing up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J locations across the country. The companies project that they will reach the milestone of 1,000 stalls across 40 states by the end of 2025. This ongoing investment in critical charging infrastructure is designed to give EV drivers the freedom and confidence to travel anywhere, anytime.

Many of the biggest barriers for wave energy so far have been logistical, including a lack of regulatory framework and licensing pathways.
Recent state legislation, Senate Bill 605, directs California to create a comprehensive roadmap for wave energy.","Along a rocky wharf at the Port of Los Angeles on Tuesday, seven blue steel structures bobbed in the gentle wake of a Catalina Island ferry. The bouncing floaters marked a moment for clean energy — the first onshore wave power project in the country.

The floaters belong to Eco Wave Power, a Swedish company behind the pilot project located at AltaSea, a nonprofit ocean institute at the port. They harness the natural rise and fall of the ocean to create clean electricity 24 hours a day.

The pilot project will generate a modest 100 kilowatts of power — enough for about 100 homes — but company officials said the ultimate goal is to install steel floaters along the port’s 8-mile breakwater to generate about 60 megawatts of power, or enough for about 60,000 homes.

Such an achievement could be replicated along other parts of the U.S. coastline, according to Inna Braverman, Eco Wave Power’s co-founder and chief executive. She noted that the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that wave power has the potential to provide more than 60% of the country’s energy needs.

“This pilot is more than a project — it’s a milestone,” Braverman said. “It shows that wave energy can be deployed right here, along existing port infrastructure, without harming the ocean, without taking up valuable space and in a scalable way.”

The technology uses the bobbing floaters to compress pistons, which push hydraulic fluid into storage tanks located nearby on land. As the pressure increases inside the tanks, it spins a motor, which turns a generator that makes clean electricity.

This is different from wave technology offshore, which can be more expensive to install, harder to repair and more difficult to connect to a grid because it’s farther from land, Braverman said. Capturing the energy at the shore enables Eco Wave Power to keep the “expensive parts” on dry land and avoid disturbing the seabed or marine environment.

And unlike other renewables such as wind and solar power, which cannot produce electricity around the clock unless accompanied by batteries, wave energy is 24/7.

The two-year pilot at the Port of L.A. is one of several efforts from Eco Wave Power, which is also pursuing projects in Taiwan, India, Portugal and New Jersey, and already has connected a wave energy project to the grid in Israel. Its total project pipeline is more than 404 megawatts.

“I think what they’re doing is an incredibly important stepping stone toward a proper full-scale deployment in the ocean,” said Bryson Robertson, director of the Pacific Marine Energy Center and a professor at Oregon State University, who is not involved with the project.

“Any time people are testing and developing novel technologies — particularly those that harness the renewable power of the ocean — that’s a fantastic situation,” Robertson said. “I think it’s great to see this technology move forward.”

Indeed, the pilot could help the city and state reach their ambitious climate goals, including L.A.’s plan to reach 100% clean energy in L.A. by 2035, and California’s plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2045.

It could also help clean up the port, which has long struggled with pollution issues linked to ship engines, diesel trucks and other freight equipment that spews particulate matter into the air. Communities near the port, such as Wilmington and Carson, suffer from some of the worst air in the area.

Projects like Eco Wave Power are “critical for us in our long-term strategy to become the first zero-emission port complex in the world,” said Michael Galvin, the port’s director of waterfront and commercial real estate. The complex, which includes the Port of L.A. and the adjoining Port of Long Beach, aims to convert all cargo-handling equipment to zero emissions by 2030, and all short-haul trucks to zero emissions by 2035.

Scaling onshore wave energy is not without challenges, however. While the U.S. has a lot of potential, the country’s entire coastline would never be covered in wave energy devices, Robertson said.

Instead, researchers are studying the best ways to deploy the technology, including taking advantage of existing infrastructure, as Eco Wave Power has done. The wharf at AltaSea had not been used in about 20 years.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been slashing federal funding for renewable energy projects, including wind and solar, while clearing the path for fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. However, the president’s sweeping January executive order geared toward “unleashing American energy” named hydropower as a potential future source of domestic energy, and wave energy proponents are hoping that includes them.

“No country in the world owns the marine energy sector,” Robertson said. “The U.S. still has a very unique opportunity to be a global leader in this sector and sell that technology to the rest of the world.”

The pilot project at AltaSea cost less than $1 million, about half of which was funded by Eco Wave Power and half by the oil and gas company Shell, according to Braverman, the chief executive. She said the company recently did a feasibility study and identified an initial 77 sites in the U.S. that would be suitable for the commercial wave energy.

At scale, she said the cost is comparable to onshore wind, and less than offshore wind.

The industrial sector is a major contributor to this environmental challenge.

According to Capgemini, the sector is responsible for more than 35% of greenhouse gas emissions, with Scope 3 emissions accounting for 70% of this figure.

Capgemini’s 'Building Sustainable Value Chains' report states that without intervention, rising emissions could lead to a global temperature increase of 4.1–4.8°C by 2100, which far surpasses the 1.5–2°C target set by the Paris Agreement.

However, this push for sustainable transformation also offers a considerable opportunity for businesses to improve cost efficiency, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

The complexities of corporate decarbonisation

While sustainability is a priority for many corporations, executing a successful strategy remains a substantial challenge.

Half of all companies acknowledge they are not on schedule with their Scope 3 decarbonisation targets and 67% report having low confidence in their ability to create and implement mature roadmaps for change.

Several barriers contribute to this difficulty, including:

difficulty in making a strong business case for long-term sustainability investments.

complexity in tracking and accurately reporting carbon emissions.

obstacles in decarbonising supply chains.

limited scalability of low-carbon technologies.

The challenge is further complicated by variations between sectors. In industries such as cement, steel and mining, Scope 1 emissions are the primary concern.

In contrast, for sectors like chemicals, electronics and food, the main issue lies with Scope 3 emissions, necessitating deep collaboration with suppliers, manufacturers and consumer brands.

“Building a sustainable value chain is an iterative process,” explain Cyril Garcia, Group Executive Board Member and Head of Sustainability at Capgemini and Charlotte Pierron-Perlès, Global Head of Intelligent Industry at Capgemini Invent, in the report.

“It requires a balanced approach between short-term quick wins, such as energy efficiency and sustainable product design improvements and long-term action, such as strategising on the product portfolio, sustainable asset investment and supply chain redesign.”

The business case for sustainability

Despite these obstacles, there is strong evidence supporting the advantages of developing sustainable value chains.

Sustainable practices can directly improve cost efficiency by lowering energy consumption, reducing carbon taxes and optimising operational processes.

For instance, a packaging redesign guided by a life-cycle assessment cut a product's carbon footprint from 10 to three kgCO₂e while also reducing costs.

In another case, an automotive project successfully lowered Scope 1 emissions by 27% and Scope 2 emissions by 13% across 17 different sites.

Circular business models have also shown impressive results, with the water and automotive sectors demonstrating material savings of up to 50% and cost reductions of 70%.

Furthermore, the use of digital twins and AI models enabled one heavy industry client to decrease its kiln energy consumption by 15% and shorten development cycles by 70%.

A framework for successful transformation

Capgemini has outlined three core pillars that underpin a successful value chain transformation.

The first is sustainable product design, which involves integrating eco-friendly materials, energy efficiency and circularity from the initial design phase to lower costs, extend product life and enhance competitiveness.

The second pillar, sustainable manufacturing, focuses on moving to low-carbon energy sources, improving water and waste efficiency and adopting circular production models to reduce both emissions and operational expenses.

The final pillar, sustainable supply chains, involves responsible sourcing, logistics optimisation and ESG transparency to minimise reliance on vulnerable resources and bolster resilience against market volatility.

Data, digitalisation and AI are crucial in expediting this sustainable transformation.

These technologies facilitate predictive modelling, improved decision-making and traceability throughout the value chain.

For example, one manufacturer with 8,000 suppliers and 350,000 product references used an automated product carbon footprint system to develop a thorough decarbonisation roadmap. “Digital transformation and AI are a formidable opportunity to get faster and improve decision-making throughout this transformation as they help achieve better designs, more productive assets and more flexible supply chains,” say Cyril and Charlotte in the report.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/390a472582df92980380e0c739298e65:d348d3787c6624b7085c581ca8de0bac/cap-energy.webp.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 06:59:47.679875

Singapore plans to mandate a 1% SAF blend in 2026, increasing to 3-5% by 2030, and charge a SAF levy to fund supply chain development.
Global SAF production in 2024 stood at just 1.3 billion litres, barely 0.3% of total jet fuel demand.
India’s SAF imperative The country has taken early steps.","Aviation contributes barely 2–3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, yet it is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Unlike road transport, where electrification is well underway, the physics of long-haul flight leave batteries too heavy and hydrogen still a decade away from commercial viability. Jet fuel, with its unmatched energy density and compatibility with global infrastructure, continues to dominate.

This is why Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) matters. As a “drop-in” fuel compatible with existing aircraft and refueling infrastructure, SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80% depending on the production pathway. While future technologies will take years to mature, SAF can begin cutting aviation’s carbon footprint today.

The world takes off

Globally, SAF is gathering pace. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires all EU airports to blend 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050. The United States, under the Inflation Reduction Act, offers tax credits of $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF, tied to emissions reductions of at least 50%. Singapore plans to mandate a 1% SAF blend in 2026, increasing to 3-5% by 2030, and charge a SAF levy to fund supply chain development. Japan targets 10% SAF use by 2030, while South Korea mandates 1% for international flights by 2027.

Airlines are responding. Many carriers have signed multi-year offtake agreements. Corporate travel programmes are also investing in SAF purchases, reflecting a growing willingness to pay for climate-conscious flying.

Yet the challenge looms. Global SAF production in 2024 stood at just 1.3 billion litres, barely 0.3% of total jet fuel demand. Even with 2024 volumes doubling, output remains far short due to weak airline margins and limited incentives. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aviation requires 450 billion litres of SAF annually by 2050 to meet net-zero goals, with SAF delivering 65% of emission reduction. Meeting this target would require investments of nearly $128 billion per year

India’s edge

India is the world’s third-largest aviation market, with more than 350 million passengers annually. Domestic air travel is growing at 10–12% per year, and fleet expansions at Air India and IndiGo will significantly increase aviation emissions within a decade. Efficiency gains from newer aircraft and better operations will help, but not nearly enough.

Here, SAF offers a realistic bridge between growth and sustainability. Unlike many countries, India enjoys a natural feedstock advantage. It produces around 680 million tonnes of agricultural residue annually, of which 180 million tonnes is surplus. Add to this used cooking oil, non-edible oilseeds, sugarcane by-products like bagasse and press mud, and organic municipal waste, and the potential is significant. With these pathways— Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet—India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF each year, enough to meet a 50% blend by 2030.

India’s successful ethanol blending programme offers valuable lessons. Rising from 1.5% in 2014 to more than 19% in July 2025, it has built supply chains, policies, and production facilities that could provide a springboard for SAF.

India’s SAF imperative

The country has taken early steps. Recently, one of India’s leading largest oil and gas enterprises’ s Panipat refinery Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery secured international certification to produce SAF from used cooking oil targeting 35,000 tonnes annually. The mandate requires 1% blending for international flights by 2027, rising to 2% by 2028. But production remains negligible, despite abundant feedstock and growing private interest.

To move from pilots to commercial scale, India needs a clear roadmap:

Production-linked incentives (PLIs) to de-risk early investments.

Carbon credit mechanisms to monetize emission reductions.

Feedstock aggregation and airport blending infrastructure.

Long-term offtake agreements between producers and airlines to stabilize demand.

Green travel levies and CSR/ ESG capital by India Inc. to decarbonize aviation.

Positioning India as a SAF exporter to Asia-pacific and Middle east, where demand is high, but feedstock is scarce.

Equally important is choosing the right pathway to technology. Quick wins can come from HEFA leveraging waste oils and fats, scaling Alcohol-to-Jet, integrating with the ethanol supply chain, investing in Fischer-Tropsch to use residues and waste, and developing Power-to-Liquids technology for synthetic fuel.

From potential to leadership

India’s SAF story is a classic paradox – abundant feedstock and rising demand on one side, but negligible production and weak incentives on the other. With the right mix of policy clarity, investment support, technology choices, and global partnerships, India can not only decarbonise its domestic skies but also emerge as a global hub for SAF supply.

The US is still expected to reduce its planet-heat emissions by between 26% and 35% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to the report.
In the worst case, in which clean energy is severely constrained by economic and political factors, US emissions could even tick up slightly at the end of 2030s, the report states.
“The US was already off-track in meeting its contribution to emissions cuts and this is now a fairly big step in the wrong direction.
“We won’t see the impacts of the Trump administration in the emissions data for a couple of years, I think,” said King.","A jump in greenhouse gas pollution in the US helped push global emissions higher in the first half of this year. This could be an omen of what’s to come, with Donald Trump’s pro-fossil fuel agenda set to significantly slow down the emissions cuts required to avoid disastrous climate impacts, a new forecast has found.

The “most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory” that has occurred since Trump re-entered the White House will have profound consequences for the global climate crisis by slowing the pace of US emissions cuts by as much as half the rate achieved over the past two decades, the Rhodium Group forecast states.

The US is still expected to reduce its planet-heat emissions by between 26% and 35% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to the report. But this is well down from a 38% to 56% reduction by 2035, which Rhodium forecast just last year during Joe Biden’s presidency.

None of these scenarios will be sufficient to allow the US, the world’s largest historic emitter of carbon pollution, to play its full part in helping the world avert a worsening climate breakdown coming from 2C (3.6F) or more in global heating.

The US and other governments agreed a decade ago in Paris to avoid this threshold but are badly off-track in required emissions reductions, ahead of a key UN climate meeting in Brazil in November to thrash out new targets.

Even under the best-case scenario, whereby fossil fuels become much more expensive and cheap renewable energy is swiftly deployed, the US will cut its emissions by just 43% by 2040, Rhodium found – well below Biden’s own pledged target, since jettisoned by Trump.

In the worst case, in which clean energy is severely constrained by economic and political factors, US emissions could even tick up slightly at the end of 2030s, the report states.

“That is very different to where we were before; it’s more than halving the pace of decarbonization we’ve had over the last two decades,” said Ben King, a director at Rhodium.

“The US was already off-track in meeting its contribution to emissions cuts and this is now a fairly big step in the wrong direction. The emissions trajectory is now a lot worse because of this policy whiplash.”

Under Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda, the federal government has thrown open vast areas of land and waters to drilling and mining, ditched the Paris targets and shredded almost all regulations that aim to limit greenhouse gas pollution and the emissions of other air toxins that harm people’s health.

Trump has sought to hobble the clean energy sector in the US, signing a Republican spending bill that kills off incentives for new solar, wind and battery projects and instructing his administration to halt new renewables facilities, even if they were previously approved and nearly completed.

“We don’t allow windmills and we don’t want the solar panels,” the president said recently. Trump, who has a longstanding animus towards wind after objecting to viewing “ugly” wind turbines from his Scottish golf course, has conversely praised “beautiful clean coal” and encouraged fossil fuel producers to bypass pollution rules.

This stance towards renewables, despite the administration demanding more supply to meet growing electricity demand, has already had a tangible impact. Offshore wind farms have been halted, while plans for a battery factory in North Carolina have been canceled and a plant in Michigan has recently been closed.

In all, nearly 65,000 clean energy jobs have been lost or stalled since Trump’s election, according to the Climate Power group, with household power bills rising as a result of the cuts to cheaper renewables.

“Unfortunately, federal policy obstacles and restrictive mandates are threatening hundreds of billions in planned energy investment,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, which last week reported solar installations had plummeted by a quarter in the first half of 2025.

“The uncertainty created by new bureaucratic delays and unclear demands is having a chilling effect on the pipeline for future energy projects, stalling growth precisely when our nation needs more energy to power a growing economy.”

The emissions impact of all of this will become obvious over the next couple of years, Rhodium’s King said. A preview of this can be seen in the first six months of the year, during which US emissions rose by 1.4% compared with the same period last year, according to Climate Trace.

This bump in emissions, aided by a similar rise in Brazil, ensured that global emissions were slightly higher than the first half of 2024, a stark sign of the task ahead for governments in tackling the climate crisis without the leadership of the US, the world’s second largest emitter.

“We won’t see the impacts of the Trump administration in the emissions data for a couple of years, I think,” said King.

“But we are already seeing a slowdown in renewables installations and, to be honest, even a flatlining of emissions is a pretty bad indicator of the trajectory we need to be on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e195d90d0a87664850db2a2b13fead241d4f9bc5/457_0_3334_2667/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75a8208f9f6b0f3bde8137587d75e727",N,,2025-09-10 06:59:51.913502

The economic model for building strong communities: Union jobs do more than construct buildings. They build careers, strengthen local economies and ensure that tax dollars stay in the region. In short, they offer a strategic launch pad for a better life, providing livable wages and strong union benefits that enable workers to support their families, purchase homes and invest in their communities. This ripple effect, involving union carpenters and other trades, benefits not just the bottom line, but also local communities.

These are the kinds of investments that change lives. It's much more than just about data centers. With union support and participation, working-class people have a real-world opportunity for a middle-class career with dignity, pride and a future.

Responsible construction that lasts: Union labor doesn't cut corners. From safety standards and training to apprenticeship programs and project oversight, the union model ensures quality construction done right the first time. Whether it's concrete forming, steel framing, interior systems or clean energy retrofits, union trades bring experience, professionalism and accountability to every phase of a project.

Google recognizes the value of union labor: It is easy to talk about economic development. However, Google's investment, backed by a commitment to union labor and project labor agreements, demonstrates that it can work successfully for investors, labor and the communities it serves.

The partnership between Google and organized labor symbolizes a powerful economic force for progress that benefits the company, unions and communities throughout Pennsylvania.

Training the next generation: The Carpenters Union is already prepared to meet this moment. With training centers across Pennsylvania — including in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Lebanon, Duncansville and Allentown — the union is developing the next generation of workers to fill these in-demand careers. From apprenticeships to continuing education in green building practices, union apprenticeship and continuing education programs ensure workers are ready for the jobs of tomorrow.

Clean energy, clean jobs: Part of Google's plan includes a $3 billion upgrade to its hydropower facilities, aiming to provide 100% carbon-free electricity for its operations. Union labor will be central to these upgrades, which demand the precision, safety and long-term durability that only trained union professionals deliver.

Union labor is the future: The Google announcement has the potential to elevate Pennsylvania to a national leadership position in AI infrastructure and clean energy. And we expect that organized labor will be front and center in these efforts. What is at stake is more than just jobs. They represent real-world pathways to the middle-class, supported by family-sustaining wages and skills that will build the artificial intelligence infrastructure for decades.

However, policy headwinds from the Trump administration, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1) and recent executive actions, have led to sharply reduced deployment forecasts. This policy reversal is also resulting in rising uncertainty across the solar sector.

Policy Headwinds Threaten Solar Growth

Key provisions in HR1 and other recent federal actions have triggered the most significant downturn in US solar outlooks since the boom of recent years, warn industry analysts.

The low-case scenario in the latest SEIA/Wood Mackenzie report predicts the United States could lose 44 GW of new solar deployment by 2030, an 18 percent decline from current forecasts. Compared to pre-HR1 projections, the deployment shortfall could reach 55 GW or 21 percent by the end of the decade.

Interestingly, one of the report highlights is that 77 percent of solar capacity installed so far in 2025 occurred in states carried by President Trump in the last election. These include Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas, all among the top 10 for new projects.

SEIA President Abigail Ross Hopper emphasised, “Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, supplying the majority of new power at the lowest cost. Federal policy changes are stifling investment, raising energy costs, and putting grid reliability at risk. Yet demand for reliable, affordable energy continues to drive industry growth.”

Manufacturing and Market Momentum at Risk

The US added 13 GW of new solar module manufacturing capacity in the first half of 2025, bringing the national total to 55 GW. But no new upstream manufacturing investments were made in Q2. This is because the manufacturers and investors awaited clarity on federal policies, with billions in private capital said to be at risk of stalling.

Analysts also note that while near-term deployments are supported by projects already in motion and a rush to beat tax credit deadlines, long-term prospects are shadowed by permitting slowdowns and regulatory changes that threaten major new projects, especially in Arizona, California, and Nevada.

Policy Changes Affecting Future Growth

The solar industry is navigating significant federal policy shifts, notably the OBBBA’s phaseout of key tax credits for solar and residential systems after 2027 and 2025, respectively.

Additionally, new permitting requirements from the Department of the Interior and altered Treasury definitions on tax credit eligibility have introduced further uncertainty.

These factors are integrated into SEIA’s base and low-case forecasts projecting 246 GWdc and 202 GWdc of solar deployment, respectively, from 2025 to 2030, reflecting decreases of 4 percent and 18 percent compared to pre-OBBBA expectations. This raises serious concerns regarding the energy future of one of the top energy-consuming countries in the world.

Industry Alarm

SEIA and Wood Mackenzie caution that if current trends persist, US grid reliability and economic competitiveness could suffer, and the administration’s ambitions in emerging technologies like AI may falter.

Industry leaders have called on Congress and the administration to reverse new executive actions, warning of higher electricity prices, lost jobs, and diminished investment in America’s growing clean energy sector.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/09/10/crushing-us-solar-adds-18-gw-in-h1-2025-as-policy-clouds-darken-industry-outlook-2025-09-10-13-52-49.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 11:02:55.216767

A DfT spokesperson said: “We’re powering up an EV revolution in the UK and delivering £381 million to install over 100,000 chargepoints across the country, including in Brighton and Hove, so that local people can confidently make the switch to electric.

“More chargepoints on our streets will make it easier and cheaper to own an electric vehicle, meaning people can charge up cheaply no matter where they live and no matter where they travel.”

Taxpayers foot 63 percent of crop insurance payouts, on average, while farmer premiums cover the rest.","“He said he’d starve to death if he didn’t do something else,” McCormick said.

McCormick stuck with the land, and now, at age 71, he grows corn, wheat, soybeans, peaches, and cover crops like rye grass, turnips, and clover. He also raises 40 head of cattle and runs a duck-hunting business on wetlands he restored.

Flooding is an ongoing a challenge for his farm, nestled between the White and Wabash rivers in the flood-prone Mississippi River basin—and climate change is making it worse. Intensive rains magnify flooding or leave fields too wet for much of the season, lowering yields. For McCormick and the many other American farmers who now face extreme precipitation, this adds stress to an already difficult industry. And the scant resources available to help producers adapt to climate change are only shrinking under the Trump administration.

“The fact is that it floods more frequently now, and it rises quicker,” McCormick said. This April, for example, the White River rose 27 feet—a full 11 feet above flood stage—inundating McCormick’s lower farm fields, but luckily before spring planting. “You can imagine the force of that river coming down, [as if] you chisel-plowed your ground,” McCormick said. “[The river] rips off a lot of soil.”

To lessen the impacts of flooding and extreme rainfall on his farm, McCormick implements a variety of conservation practices. He doesn’t till his fields, leaving them undisturbed to help build soil organic matter and structure and lessen erosion. That, plus the spiderweb of clover and rye planted among last year’s corn stalks, kept his soil from washing away this spring.

Experts say that such conservation measures are critical for building resilience to climate change as farmers increasingly grapple with flooding, drought, and other climate impacts. As these risks continue to mount, however, conservation resources are harder to come by.

Increased Spending, but ‘For the Wrong Things’

Moreover, crop insurance reform is badly needed to incentivize sustainable farming practices and better cover all farmers facing extreme weather losses.

“Crop insurance is getting more expensive because of climate change, [yet] spending more money on climate resilience practices could lower [those] costs.”

“Crop insurance is getting more expensive because of climate change, [yet] spending more money on climate resilience practices could lower [those] costs,” said Anne Schechinger, Midwest director at the Environmental Working Group, who authored a recent study on farm funding.

Also, far more taxpayer dollars are spent on crop insurance subsidies, often propping up unsustainable farming practices, than on conservation programs. Taxpayers foot 63 percent of crop insurance payouts, on average, while farmer premiums cover the rest.

“We’re spending money for the wrong things,” Schechinger said.

EWG’s study found that the USDA paid $11 billion for crop losses from flooding and excess precipitation in the 13-state Mississippi River Critical Conservation Area (MRCCA) between 2017 and 2024, while the agency allocated only $745 million for climate resilience measures through its flagship conservation initiative, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP.

That imbalance generally holds nationwide, even for farmers who aren’t operating in a 100-year floodplain like the MRCCA, Schechinger said. (A 100-year floodplain is defined as having a 1 percent chance of flooding every year.) Knox County, Indiana, for example, isn’t classified as one, but crop insurance payments for excess rain and flooding there totaled $21.5 million from 2017 to 2024, while EQIP payments for climate resilience were just $2.3 million.",https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/as-extreme-weather-increases-flooding-on-farms-federal-support-for-climate-resilience-evaporates-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 07:01:07.963616

A new study published today in Nature has, for the first time, directly tied hundreds of heat waves to these so-called carbon major entities.
“Now we do.” The new study examined 213 heat waves that took place across 63 countries between 2000 and 2023, all of which caused significant human or economic losses.
For instance, they found that emissions from the former Soviet Union made 53 heat waves since 2000 at least 10,000 times more likely.
Even the smallest emitter in the database, a Russian coal company called Elgaugol, made 16 heat waves possible that otherwise would have been virtually impossible.","One hundred and eighty of the world’s largest oil, gas, coal, and cement producers are collectively responsible for the heat waves that have killed hundreds of thousands of people over the past two decades. A new study published today in Nature has, for the first time, directly tied hundreds of heat waves to these so-called carbon major entities.

Although communities and activists have long pointed to these entities’ role in driving extreme heat, few judicial cases have held any company accountable. Courts often dismiss lawsuits for lack of evidence. This new study provides crucial data that could help make justice possible.

The carbon majors “have long claimed that the impacts of climate change are too far removed from emissions for any principle of accountability to apply,” said climate scientist Dr. Christopher Callahan at Indiana University Bloomington, who was not involved in the research. This study, he said, “shows that that claim is false.”

Until recently, extreme weather attribution has mostly focused on single disasters. Such studies typically assess whether climate change made a given event more likely, but they do not identify who was responsible for the emissions that drove those changes.

That gap is what led climate scientist Dr. Yann Quilcaille and his team from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich to look for the culprits.

By tracing emissions back to their producers, Quilcaille said, attribution science can support communities seeking damages or stronger climate action. “We didn’t have that information before,” Quilcaille said. “Now we do.”

The new study examined 213 heat waves that took place across 63 countries between 2000 and 2023, all of which caused significant human or economic losses. The researchers compared the probability and intensity of each heat wave under today’s conditions with a hypothetical scenario in which global temperatures remained at preindustrial levels. The analysis showed that, compared with preindustrial conditions, climate change made heat waves 20 times more likely between 2000 and 2009, and up to 200 times more likely between 2010 and 2019.

The researchers then compiled historical records to estimate emissions dating back to the mid-19th century for 180 carbon majors, including 174 companies like ExxonMobil and six nation-state producers like China. Using simulations, they approximated how much heat could be linked to each entity. For instance, they found that emissions from the former Soviet Union made 53 heat waves since 2000 at least 10,000 times more likely. Even the smallest emitter in the database, a Russian coal company called Elgaugol, made 16 heat waves possible that otherwise would have been virtually impossible.

Climate change on average has made heat waves 2.2 degrees Celsius hotter—or 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit—the study finds, and half of that can be attributed directly to carbon majors. The 14 biggest entities, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and China’s coal industry, were responsible for about as much warming as all the other 166 carbon majors combined.

The results are “solid” and “make a good job connecting the dots” that are necessary to hold companies accountable, said Dr. Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at the nonprofit Climate Central. These types of studies can be used as evidence in court cases. For example, a county in Oregon sued ExxonMobil and other firms in 2023 for their role in worsening the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave.

“Attribution science is an important part of these cases by showing that there is a direct connection between greenhouse gas emissions and local climate change impacts,” Callahan said. Yet so far, none of these lawsuits has been resolved, and they are advancing slowly.

In April 2025, Callahan published a study in Nature showing that emissions linked to oil giant Chevron likely caused between $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in heat-related losses between 1991 and 2020. Still, he said, “we are years away from a successful damages case against a fossil fuel producer.”

Another major barrier to reparations in the U.S. is the rollback of climate policy under President Donald Trump. His administration recently announced plans to revoke the EPA’s 2009 endangerment finding, the longstanding determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and the legal foundation for federal climate regulation. If successful, the move could erase existing emissions limits on vehicles, factories, and power plants.

“Current decision-makers are not relying on the best available science to make those decisions,” Callahan said, “and are instead taking advantage of shoddy scientific work that downplays many of the risks of climate change.”

In response, researchers at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine are conducting a rapid scientific review evaluating new evidence on climate change and health risks. The report will be published this month and aims to deliver conclusions that can endure political scrutiny and support existing climate protections.

“We live in a world that has been shaped by the fossil fuel industry,” Dahl said, “If we want to minimize future harms from that warming, we need to be steeply and drastically cutting our carbon emissions.”",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/deadly-heat-waves-hose-man-hor-1280x719.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 07:01:25.611996

The duo, along with other congressmen and congresswomen, all wrote a letter advocating for three specific initiatives to change in the 2026-2027 Renewable Volume Obligations proposed rule, according to the press release:

Align RVO volumes with market realities and ensure standards can be met with available domestic feedstocks;

Prevent the reallocation of regulatory compliance burdens to larger refiners when Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) are granted; and

Maintain a 100% Renewable Identification Number (RIN) value for imported renewable fuels and feedstocks to preserve the competitiveness of American manufacturers

The ramp-up in the production of American energy comes in response to President Donald Trump’s mission to increase domestic energy and less dependence on importing foreign energy, which the letter addressed:

“[We] commend your effective leadership in implementing President Trump’s mission to ‘Unleash American Energy’ by swiftly reversing the Biden administration’s all-out assault on domestic energy production…To maintain the viability of the liquid fuel manufacturing industry and keep energy costs low for American consumers and businesses, it is critical the EPA modifies its June 2025 proposed rule on Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) established under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2026 and 2027.”

Driven by the imperative to phase out Russian gas by 2027 and secure energy security amid geopolitical volatility, the EU has locked in long-term procurement agreements with American suppliers. These contracts, underpinned by a $750 billion U.S. energy purchase commitment over three yearsThe U.S.-EU Energy Deal: A Strategic Win For Europe?[ 3 ], are reshaping the competitive landscape for energy majors like ExxonMobil, while accelerating market consolidation in the LNG sector.

Strategic Rationale for EU-U.S. LNG Ties

The EU's reliance on Russian gas plummeted from 45% in early 2022 to just 13% by 2025Working to Deliver the Energy Europe Needs[ 2 ], a transformation fueled by the REPowerEU Plan and the July 2025 U.S.-EU trade agreement. U.S. LNG now accounts for 58% of European importsUS LNG Exports to Europe Hit Record Levels in February 2025[ 4 ], a figure expected to rise as infrastructure like the Plaquemines LNG terminal in Louisiana ramps up capacityUS LNG Exports to Europe Hit Record Levels in February 2025[ 4 ]. For the EU, this shift is not merely economic but geopolitical: diversifying supply chains to insulate against future disruptions and aligning with U.S. strategic interests in countering Russian influence.

Energy majors like ExxonMobil are central to this transition. The company anticipates multi-decade contracts with the EU, leveraging its dominance in U.S. shale production and infrastructure.

has also taken proactive steps to align with European decarbonization goals, reducing its own gas consumption in European manufacturing by 65%Working to Deliver the Energy Europe Needs[ 2 ] and advancing a carbon capture project in Antwerp, Belgium, targeting 8 million metric tons of CO₂ annually by 2030Working to Deliver the Energy Europe Needs[ 2 ]. These moves position Exxon as both a supplier and a partner in the EU's energy transition.

Market Consolidation and Competitive Dynamics

The U.S. LNG sector is undergoing rapid consolidation, with majors like ExxonMobil and

acquiring smaller players (e.g., Pioneer, Hess, Endeavor) to dominate production and export infrastructureM&A trends in energy, natural resources, and chemicals[ 5 ]. This trend has reduced market fragmentation, creating a more concentrated industry structure. Meanwhile, the EU's procurement strategy—prioritizing long-term, fixed-price contracts—has incentivized U.S. firms to secure export permits and expand facilities, as seen with the Trump-era lifting of Biden's LNG export moratoriumM&A trends in energy, natural resources, and chemicals[ 5 ].

Globally, LNG markets are evolving toward more flexible contracts indexed to hubs rather than oil pricesFuture of LNG: Global strategy and supply outlook[ 1 ], a shift that could enhance liquidity but also expose buyers to price volatility. For the EU, this presents a dilemma: while U.S. LNG offers competitive pricing and geopolitical alignment, overreliance on a single supplier risks undermining diversification goalsWorking to Deliver the Energy Europe Needs[ 2 ]. Initiatives like the AggregateEU procurement platform, which pooled 100 bcm of gas demand by 2025The U.S.-EU Energy Deal: A Strategic Win For Europe?[ 3 ], aim to balance these priorities by fostering competition and pooling resources.

Challenges and Opportunities for Energy Majors

Non-U.S. energy companies face a complex landscape. European utilities remain cautious about long-term U.S. LNG contracts due to regulatory uncertainties (e.g., methane rules) and fluctuating demandWorking to Deliver the Energy Europe Needs[ 2 ]. In contrast, Asian importers, with 90% of their gas secured by long-term dealsFuture of LNG: Global strategy and supply outlook[ 1 ], offer a stark contrast in risk tolerance. For U.S. majors, the EU's procurement spree represents a golden opportunity to lock in market share, but it also demands navigating trade tensions (e.g., U.S. tariffs on European goods) and infrastructure bottlenecksWorking to Deliver the Energy Europe Needs[ 2 ].

ExxonMobil's dual strategy—expanding U.S. LNG exports while reducing its carbon footprint in Europe—highlights the broader industry trend of aligning with decarbonization while maintaining profitability. However, the company's success hinges on the EU's ability to balance energy security with market flexibility. If the bloc overcorrects toward U.S. LNG, it could stifle competition and innovation in renewables, undermining its long-term energy transition goals.

Conclusion: A New Era for LNG and Energy Security

The EU's embrace of U.S. LNG underscores the intersection of energy security, geopolitics, and market dynamics. For energy majors like ExxonMobil, this represents a strategic windfall, but it also demands navigating regulatory, infrastructural, and geopolitical risks. As the LNG sector consolidates and contracts evolve, investors must weigh the short-term gains of U.S. exports against the long-term imperative for diversified, sustainable energy systems. The coming years will test whether this partnership can deliver both security and stability—or if it will become a cautionary tale of overreliance in a volatile world.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-10 08:59:25.678904

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We, the undersigned Members of Congress representing the most diverse and energy-rich producing regions in the country, commend your effective leadership in implementing President Trump’s mission to “Unleash American Energy” by swiftly reversing the Biden administration’s all-out assault on domestic energy production. U.S. refineries are critical to achieving President Trump’s goals to restore American energy dominance, as a strong and competitive liquid fuel manufacturing industry is vital to maintaining low gasoline and energy prices while limiting inflation.

To maintain the viability of the liquid fuel manufacturing industry and keep energy costs low for American consumers and businesses, it is critical the EPA modifies its June 2025 proposed rule on Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) established under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2026 and 2027. When finalizing this rule, we urge you to consider the impact the refining sector has on the American economy, ensure the rulemaking maintains stability in the domestic fuels market, and sustain a strong and competitive industry that is vital to our nation’s energy security.

In particular, we recommend minimizing RVO increases to avoid a large and expansive regulatory mandate on the industry. Overall, the liquid fuel manufacturing industry has made significant investments and spent billions of dollars to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) since its inception in 2005. A significant increase in RVO obligations would place an unsustainable burden on refineries and significantly increase costs on U.S. consumers and businesses.

Additionally, we urge that Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) do not reallocate regulatory burdens on larger refiners. SREs are essential to helping small refineries manage the regulatory costs of the RFS program, but it is critical these obligations are not transferred to other refineries. Reallocating these obligations would place an undue burden on companies that have invested billions of dollars to legally comply with the program and create significant disruptions in the fuel market.

Finally, we recommend the EPA maintain a 100% Renewable Identification Number (RIN) value for imported renewable fuels and feedstocks. Domestic producers rely on global supply chains for cost-effective feedstocks and imports are critical to the viability of the domestic refinery industry. If the RIN value for foreign feedstocks is reduced, domestic fuel manufacturers will be at a competitive disadvantage compared to foreign producers, hampering President Trump’s strategy to unleash American energy.

As such, we urge EPA’s final RVO rule to:

· Minimize RVO volumes to be in alignment with market realities and to reflect standards that can be met with domestic feedstocks;

· Prevent the reallocation of RIN obligations for any granted SREs; and

· Maintain a 100% Renewable Identification Number (RIN) value for imported renewable fuels and feedstocks.

We sincerely thank you for your strong support of the domestic liquid fuels industry and look forward to our continued work together to Make American Energy Great Again.",https://pfluger.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 07:00:48.234967

The project is a large leap toward meeting the world’s sustained need for traditional fuels while positioning the U.S.—and Louisiana specifically—as a cornerstone supplier of low-cost natural gas to world markets.

The project was acquired in 2023 by Woodside with its acquisition of Tellurian, is anticipated to begin producing gas in 2029. Its development will be phased, with early development including the construction of three liquefaction trains that have a capacity to produce up to 16.5 million metric tons of LNG annually. Woodside also has permission to ramp up output to as much as 27.6 million tons a year—emphasizing the project’s scope and flexibility.

Calling the ultimate investment decision a “historic moment,” Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill underscored the pioneering scale of the project. “Louisiana LNG is a game-changer for Woodside,” she said. “It makes our company a global LNG leader and enables us to deliver enduring returns to shareholders.”

To reassure investors of the project’s capital intensity, Woodside estimates an internal rate of return of over 13% and anticipates net operating cash flow of $2 billion annually from the first phase commencing in 2030. In February, Woodside further de-risked the investment by signing an agreement to sell a 40% stake in the supporting infrastructure of the project to Stonepeak for $5.7 billion—an injection that will pay for about 75% of capital expenditure in 2025 and 2026.

“This de-risked and compelling investment world-class project maximizes Woodside’s underlying strength in project delivery, operations, and customer connection to create long-term value,” O’Neill said.

Louisiana’s Rise as Global Energy Powerhouse

The Louisiana LNG development not only adds depth to Woodside’s global portfolio—balancing long-life, flexible LNG assets with high-return oil assets—but also solidifies Louisiana’s rapidly growing energy leadership.

With industry giants Cheniere’s Sabine Pass and Sempra’s Cameron LNG already established in the state, Louisiana is proving to be a perfect export hub. The momentum is not reducing with major projects like Venture Global‘s $28 billion CP2 LNG, the recent launch of its Calcasieu Pass, and the $18 billion development at Plaquemines LNG. Combined, these projects emphasize the state’s leadership in the LNG export market while supporting economic development through the creation of jobs and higher tax revenues. Also, the Monkey Island LNG project will add on to Louisiana’s portfolio of major LNG projects in the US.

Simultaneously, Louisiana is diversifying its energy base. Woodside’s LNG project is one of an increasing number of forward-looking investments, including CF Industries’ proposed $4.2 billion blue ammonia plant in Ascension Parish, which will use carbon capture to make 1.4 million metric tons of low-carbon ammonia annually. Air Products is also moving forward on its multi-billion-dollar Louisiana Clean Energy Complex, which is clean hydrogen-oriented.

Other new developments—such as Energy Transfer’s Lake Charles LNG and Commonwealth LNG—signal further expansion, while clean energy initiatives such as the AES Oak Ridge Solar Project and the Woodland Biofuels green hydrogen facility demonstrate the state’s clean energy vision. Louisiana is also making investments in robust carbon capture and storage infrastructure, further enhancing its energy resilience.

In combining historic energy prowess with innovation, Louisiana is building a balanced path forward. Projects like Woodside’s LNG terminal and CF Industries’ ammonia plant not only indicate the state’s adaptability but also secure its central role in energizing the here and now and fueling the energy transition ahead.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/download-9.webp,N,,2025-09-10 08:59:28.829040

It presented three innovation keywords: Sustainable Electrification, Optimized integration of functions, Maximized in-vehicle user experience.

It is strengthening its lineup of leading-edge technologies, including holographic windshield display, battery system portfolio, and SDV solution

SEOUL, South Korea and MUNICH, Sept. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyundai Mobis (KRX 012330) unveiled its vision for innovative technologies that will lead the future mobility market at the IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich, Germany, reaffirming its goal of becoming a global top 3 automotive supplier. The company ranks sixth on the list of the Top 100 Global Suppliers announced by Automotive News.

On the 9th, Hyundai Mobis held a media session titled ""Automotive Trends and Hyundai Mobis' Leading Technologies"" at the Yellow Stage of the Messe Munich Center in Germany, where IAA 2025 kicked off. Axel Maschka, Head of Sales and Executive Vice President, Hyundai Mobis shared Mobis' recent achievements in the European and global markets, examples of how Mobis' future technologies are being realized through global orders, and the future technology strategies currently in preparation.

""Our vision to leap into the global Top 3 in the medium to long term is clear. Our approach of staying ahead of the market and turning crises into opportunities will be the driving force behind this vision,"" said Maschka at the beginning of his presentation. Hyundai Mobis has already secured large orders from leading global customers such as Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz through its electrification-focused strategy in Europe, and by concentrating its R&D resources on future core products, it is maintaining a solid growth momentum even in the face of the electric vehicle chasm.

Setting three innovation pillars: Sustainable Electrification, Integrated Excellence, and Vision in Motion

Hyundai Mobis announced that it will lead the market by setting three key objectives for proactive R&D and product portfolio development: ""Sustainable Electrification, Integrated Excellence, and Vision in Motion.""

The company began its battery system business in 2009 and currently holds a BSA portfolio covering all existing eco-friendly vehicles. In addition, it is continuously developing new battery technologies to ensure safety, which is considered the biggest barrier to the mass adoption of electric vehicles, thereby enhancing customer and market trust in sustainable electrification while advancing electrification technology.

Notable examples include the company's self-developed ""battery cooling system"" and ""fire extinguishing agent system."" Mobis monitors high temperatures caused by internal chemical reactions that degrade battery performance through its battery monitoring system (BMS), while simultaneously preventing battery accidents through a dual cooling system. It has also developed technology that automatically sprays fire extinguishing agents to immediately suppress fires in the event of battery cell ignition.

In the era of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), the technological capabilities of mobility companies depend on how well they can integrate and simplify vehicle structures. Hyundai Mobis secured core solutions for next-generation chassis systems, including steer-by-wire, brake-by-wire, and independent rear-wheel steering.

Currently, the company is working to enhance the completeness of these products and build an integrated solution that controls all vehicle movements with a single controller. This integrated solution is a technology that will become the core foundation of SDV by implementing a flexible vehicle architecture that transcends hardware limitations, operating steering and braking with a single software, and upgrading performance through wireless updates.

Another area of focus for Hyundai Mobis in the future mobility innovation process is ""Vision in Motion"" based on the convergence of electronic technologies. Hyundai Mobis is working to realize its goal of providing drivers sitting in the vehicle cockpit with a differentiated experience in terms of visuals and immersion that they have never experienced before.

A representative technology for this is the holographic windshield display (HWD). As the world's first HWD to apply holographic optical film, it displays all vehicle information on the windshield using special optical technology without the need for separate displays such as LED or OLED. HWD is a different technology from the recently popularized HUD (Head-Up Display), offering a new dimension of user experience by providing vehicle information, surrounding information, navigation, and even entertainment content through a wide field of view without a frame.

Global partnerships and portfolio built by Mobis based on future mobility technology

Hyundai Mobis participated in the IAA for the first time in 2021, when the electric vehicle era was in full swing, and unveiled its integrated electrification technology platform, the ""EV Skateboard."" This led to its success in securing orders for battery systems for next-generation electric vehicles from Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, and last year, the company broke ground on its BSA plant in Spain, capable of producing up to 360,000 units annually.

Through the organic integration of automotive electronics technologies, Hyundai Mobis continues to set new standards for future cockpits. The company has been updating its next-generation integrated digital cockpit, 'M.VICS,' annually and is currently receiving orders from global customers for its critical technology elements. Among these, the holographic AR HUD (augmented reality head-up display) is nearing market launch through collaboration with global automakers.

Hyundai Mobis is improving its business structure by focusing on high-value-added products for future mobility and promoting advanced research and development to strengthen its presence and position in the global market. Based on this, the company plans to expand the proportion of global customers in the core parts sector to 40% by 2033. At IAA 2025, the company is also inviting global customers to showcase its core parts portfolio and conduct aggressive sales activities.

""Our strategy is to proactively develop differentiated technologies that meet customer needs, drive technological paradigm shifts, and expand our position in the global market. We will establish our position as a leading mobility technology company by combining new technology competitiveness, advanced execution capabilities, and speed,"" said Lee Gyu-suk, President and CEO of Hyundai Mobis, at the ""2025 CEO Investor Day"" held last month.

“The report grossly understates both the impacts of climate change we already observe in Washington State and the role of greenhouse gas emissions in causing these impacts,” a Sept. 2 letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright from Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller states reads, referencing a U.S. Department of Energy draft report, “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emission on U.S. Climate,” published last month.

The letter continues: “This so-called ‘science review’ report lacks scientific integrity, ignores current climate impacts on Washington communities and fails to protect Americans from what we know is coming. It is a means crafted to justify a predetermined end. I urge you to withdraw this report as it will only serve to justify increasing greenhouse gas pollution, accelerating climate change impacts, furthering economic hardship, and intensifying extreme weather events on Washingtonians.”

Ecology claims its experts reviewed the U.S. Department of Energy’s report and found “factual errors and inconsistencies with the latest national and international peer-reviewed research.”

In July, Ecology put out a 91-page report on anthropogenic climate change and recommendations for limits on greenhouse gas emissions in Washington.

Todd Myers is WPC’s vice president of research. He recently posted a blog critical of Ecology’s criticism of the Trump administration, noting that the state agency has failed to produce emissions data to prove whether or not Washington is meeting its climate goals.

“By law, they are required to release CO2 emissions data for the state, and they haven’t,” Myers told The Center Square on Tuesday. “Currently, we’re in September of 2025, and the most recent data we have is from 2021. That’s completely useless if you’re a policymaker and trying to determine how we’re doing in meeting our goals.”

As Myers mentions in his blog, WPC has sued Ecology for its failure to release emissions data in a timely manner. The case was dismissed in June.

“The Department of Ecology can find the resources to quickly release this report while claiming they do not have the resources to release accurate and timely emissions data,” Myers wrote in his blog. “The release of this new report makes it clear that Ecology has enough resources to attack political opponents but not to comply with the law and meet their own obligations to address the risks of climate change in Washington state.”

Myers noted in his blog, “According to EPA data, which account for most but not all state CO2 emissions, Washington state’s emissions increased in 2022. Incomplete data from the state also indicate emissions increased in 2022 and 2023.”

Myers doesn’t think Ecology is hiding anything.

“I think that they just don’t care,” he speculated. “They know the policies they want, and they know what they want to do, and no matter what is happening in terms of the actual data, it doesn’t matter. So, it’s just not a priority. But dunking on the Trump administration is a priority. It is political, and it is fun for them. So that’s where they put the resources.”

Myers contends Ecology and the University of Washington repeatedly misstate snowpack data related to climate change.

“Consistently, they have claimed that snowpack is declining, and that’s false. Snowpack as measured by the federal government and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has actually been above normal for 14 of the last 20 years,” he explained.

He argues that if climate change is the existential crisis that Ecology claims, the department should be closely monitoring results.

“So that you can come up with a policy approach that reduces CO2 emissions effectively,” Myers noted. “The fact that they don’t care indicates that their action doesn’t match their rhetoric. They care more about policies and symbolism than they do results.”

Dear Mr. Saunders:

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (“the U.S. Chamber”) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s request for comments cited above. The Administration has stated it intends to use these comments as part of an investigation to “determine the effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines and their parts and components.”

Ample supplies of affordable electricity is itself a national security imperative, underpinning U.S. defense readiness, advanced manufacturing, and America’s leadership in artificial intelligence. The renewable energy industry assists in addressing this imperative by helping to meet the nation’s surging demand for electricity. The U.S. Chamber strongly supports all forms of energy that can contribute to the reliability and affordability of electricity. This is especially important as our electricity demand is increasing at unprecedented rates due to the imperative that America lead the world in the development of advanced technologies, manufacturing, and artificial intelligence. As such, the U.S. needs to utilize all of the power generation tools available—including natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar—to support the highest levels of reliability while maintaining affordable electricity rates.

Wind energy, in particular, optimizes grid reliability and is critical to key districts in Iowa, Texas, and other states, including by supporting approximately 300,000 American workers throughout the wind energy supply chain. Blade, tower, and nacelle assembly plants are spread across more than a dozen U.S. states, ensuring geographic and supplier diversity that reduces dependence on any single foreign source. The economic impacts of trade restrictions would also be felt in rural communities in which landowners and farmers depend on wind projects for income and in manufacturing hubs involving tens of thousands of jobs tied to the wind supply chain.

Amid rapidly growing electricity demand, culling wind power options from the broader suite of energy sources risks sending electricity prices higher across the country, among other potential unintended consequences. This submission explores the impacts trade restrictions would have on this important sector and urges the Administration to employ an all-of-government approach focused on strengthening domestic competitiveness and job creation rather than undermining the viability of a critical component to America’s energy independence.

Limit Market Distortions in a Cost Competitive Sector

The cost competitiveness of onshore wind should not be overlooked. The deployment of onshore wind offers significant additional energy supply to meet growing demand at affordable rates. This is part of the reason why demand for wind energy in the U.S. is significantly increasing, with wind energy currently responsible for roughly 10% of U.S. electricity production, and is expected to continue this growth trend for years to come as domestic manufacturing increases and additional data centers come online to power artificial intelligence.

Prospective trade restrictions threaten to restrict this growth and reduce available energy for businesses, farmers, and consumers throughout the U.S. Moreover, any actions that serve to limit the availability of energy resources threaten to drive prices higher for consumers and businesses, undermining our nation’s global competitiveness. The Chamber urges the Administration to focus on removing barriers to all forms of energy generally, and electricity generation in particular, including renewable sources, and avoid taking actions that could negatively impact its availability or cost. In this vein, directing federal attention to one type of electricity resource over others distorts the market, limits innovation, and undermines consumer choice.

Additionally, it is critical that the Administration consider the broader investment implications of potential trade restrictions. Hindering access to critical manufacturing components will not only impact future renewable projects but also hamper relevant research and development initiatives and existing facilities in need of repairs or replacements. Such restrictions would have a significant impact on investor confidence, especially with respect to companies that have taken steps to shift supply chains out of China, where only a small percentage of U.S.-bound wind components originate today.

Supply Chain and Industrial Base Considerations

As domestic capacity continues to ramp up—with more than 400 U.S. facilities supporting land-based and offshore wind industries—supply chains connected to trusted allies in North America, Europe, and South and Southeast Asia remain essential. Not only does access to reliable sources limit exposure to China and demonstrate strategic supply chain resilience, it also allows manufacturing to continue when components and parts are not available domestically. The evidence is clear that domestic manufacturing is increasing but is not yet sufficient to meet projected demand without reliance on certain imports.

Imports of nacelles and generators, for example, are largely sourced from Mexico (48%) and India (20%). Additionally, wind turbines and parts have significant levels of U.S. content, especially blades and nacelles. Over the past three years, 40% of U.S. imports of wind turbines and all associated parts have come from Mexico. A large majority of the imported parts within the scope of this investigation are therefore imported under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). In addition to these markets, the wind industry remains diversified via U.S. and European (primarily German, Spanish, Danish and French) OEMs. These transatlantic OEMs are some of the largest suppliers to the U.S. market, with extensive manufacturing operations across the U.S. and Europe.

The implications of the Administration’s other tariff regimes (i.e., Section 232 steel, aluminum, and derivative tariffs as well as the “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on most countries) are also worth considering. The steel and aluminum measures are especially impactful since relevant turbine components contain those metals. In this sense, this section of the defense industrial base is already subject to tariffs as high as 50%. Further tariffs and other punitive restrictions on reliable sources in the wind supply chain will hurt the U.S. wind industry, and domestic power generation overall, by contracting manufacturing output and creating competitive opportunities for unreliable suppliers.

Renewable Energy is Already Supporting the American AI Boom

Electricity demand is projected to grow significantly in the coming years, driven by factors such as the expansion of data centers, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the increasing electrification of industries like manufacturing and transportation. This growth underscores the need for a reliable and affordable electricity supply to meet the demands of a modern economy. However, challenges such as regulatory delays and infrastructure limitations must be addressed to ensure that the expansion of our energy system aligns with the pace of innovation. Comprehensive permitting reforms and investments in critical infrastructure, including natural gas pipelines, renewable energy projects, and supportive transmission lines, are essential to maintaining grid reliability and affordability while supporting the national security imperative of leading the world in artificial intelligence.

Wind energy has emerged as a key contributor to our energy grid, playing a vital role in diversifying the energy mix, supporting reliability, and mitigating electricity rate increases. In the United States, wind energy accounts for a growing share of approximately 10% of electricity generation, with its continuing expansion supported by advances in technology and related declining costs.

While onshore wind is well-established in many regions of the country, offshore wind also holds significant potential given the strong attributes of this type of wind energy resource, with significant investments and projects underway. The continued development of wind energy, alongside a diverse set of other types of electricity generation resources, coupled with supportive policies and enhanced and expanded transmission infrastructure, will be critical in meeting future energy demands. Renewable energy is a key contributor to meeting the American artificial intelligence boom. If the components and inputs necessary to support this vital energy resource are impaired from being available to support the expansion of the power grid, there will be one less source available to power AI innovation, potentially causing America to fall behind its international competitors.

Conclusion

The Administration must engage in an all-of-government approach to support domestic energy production and boost supply chain resilience with reliable partners. Punitive restrictions on imports from trusted allies would undermine, not advance, U.S. energy and national security. A forward-looking strategy focused on resilience, competitiveness, and permitting reform will ensure America meets its surging energy demand while maintaining global leadership in advanced technologies.

“Bringing back the third shift to the Windsor plant is welcome news that will see our members start to come back to work early next year doing what they do best: building high quality, Canadian-made vehicles,” Unifor Local 444 President James Stewart said in a statement. “Making sure we have the best possible conditions for our plants to run at capacity is the only way we’re going to get through this trade war and clearly that message is being received loud and clear.”

GM in May announced plans to cut a shift at its Oshawa plant, citing tariffs, but is holding off on layoffs until February 2026 at the earliest. Workers there build heavy-duty and light-duty Chevrolet Silverado pickups.

""In response to current production plans, GM’s Oshawa Assembly will continue operating on three shifts through January 2026,"" GM Canada spokesperson Ariane Souza Pereira said in an email. ""At that time, the plant will return to a two-shift operation and continue preparations to build the next generation of full-size, gas-powered pickups. We continue to work closely with Unifor to support employees throughout this transition.”

Unifor Local 222 President Jeff Gray, who represents workers at the plant, said the union will “continue to push for the third shift to be maintained and ensure that autoworker jobs in Oshawa aren’t another casualty in this trade war.""

Unifor's president said she's still concerned about the future of Stellantis' Brampton Assembly Plant in Ontario.

Workers at Brampton previously built the Dodge Charger and Challenger, as well as the Chrysler 300, before plant production ended in late 2023 and workers were laid off. Since then, the automaker has been retooling the facility in preparation for the new electrified Jeep Compass SUV.

“Restarting the third shift in Windsor and delaying the end of the third shift in Oshawa are steps in the right direction, but we’re watching the Stellantis Brampton plant closely,” Payne said in reference to the company’s announced pause on retooling plans at the assembly plant west of Toronto. “We will continue to press Stellantis on its operational plans for the Brampton facility and pressure the federal government to live up to its commitment to fight alongside workers for their jobs in these uncertain economic times.”

Trump's sometimes-punitive trade policies with Canada ripped open a rift between Canadian and American auto workers. While the Detroit-based United Auto Workers has shown tempered support for Trump’s tariffs, Unifor is fighting new levies.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/02/PDTN/78145321007-getty-images-2196315984.jpg?crop=4449,2506,x0,y369&width=3200&height=1803&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-09 22:04:08.090283

In a recent interview with Spectrum News 1 Dallas, Jackson Walker partner Robert L. Soza and senior counsel Jenny Roan Forgey discussed both the scope of the term “real property” and the practical implications of the new legislation for foreign investors already operating in the state.

Jenny emphasized that the statutory definition is sweeping: “Real property includes things like mines, quarries, mineral interests, water rights, standing timber, industrial property, ground water, commercial property, agricultural land and an improvement on agricultural land.”

Robert highlighted the legal uncertainty affecting both sides of the market: “Both buyers and sellers are struggling with trying to figure out what can and can’t be done. Even those people who have purchased property, for example, from China prior to this law, are concerned about whether or not they can continue to own the property, which, we’ve been advising that they can.”

How the statute will be enforced and whether additional guidance will emerge remain open questions. For now, stakeholders confronting cross-border real estate deals in Texas should proceed with heightened diligence.

His Aug. 29 executive order follows enactment of the federal budget reconciliation law in July that rolled back provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and shortened eligibility timelines for clean power project tax incentives. “California will continue our decades of progress,” Newsom said in issuing the order. “No other state ... has built as much clean energy as fast.”

Under new federal tax guidance, projects above 1.5 MW must show “significant physical work” by July 4, 2026 and be placed in service before the end of 2027 to qualify.

“The STARFIRE Hub is excited to welcome the University of Arizona to our constellation of partners.
Strong academic collaborations are essential for advancing fusion technology and developing the next generation of fusion pioneers.
Together, we are working to make fusion energy a reality,” said Tammy Ma, STARFIRE principal investigator and lead for inertial fusion energy at LLNL.","The University of Arizona has joined a national, multi-institution research hub to advance the manufacturing technologies required for achieving the benefits of fusion – a safe and sustainable energy source.

The IFE STARFIRE Hub is a public and private partnership established in 2023 with a four-year, $16 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California spearheads the hub’s effort to accelerate inertial fusion energy, or IFE, science and technology. STARFIRE is one of three DOE-funded hubs focused on IFE.

IFE fuses hydrogen isotopes to produce abundant and clean energy. However, harnessing the fusion reactions that fuel stars will require scientists to overcome formidable barriers.

STARFIRE Hub membership positions Arizona to advance IFE innovation and education through close collaboration with other partners – universities, national laboratories and businesses – to address the world’s energy security challenges, said Tomás Díaz de la Rubia, senior vice president for research and partnerships.

“The promise of fusion energy lies not only in its scientific ambition but in the transformative partnerships it inspires,” Díaz de la Rubia said. “By aligning with the STARFIRE Hub, Arizona is advancing a bold vision that connects our institutional strengths with a national effort to accelerate fusion innovation, train the workforce of the future and deliver clean, abundant energy for generations to come.”

U of A leaders, aided by stakeholder communities, recently identified fusion energy as a top-priority research initiative. The Arizona Board of Regents has provided funding from the state’s Technology and Research Initiative Fund, or TRIF, to propel the university’s commercial fusion efforts.

“The STARFIRE Hub is excited to welcome the University of Arizona to our constellation of partners. Strong academic collaborations are essential for advancing fusion technology and developing the next generation of fusion pioneers. Together, we are working to make fusion energy a reality,” said Tammy Ma, STARFIRE principal investigator and lead for inertial fusion energy at LLNL.

Horst Hahn, a world-renowned materials scientist and foreign member of the National Academy of Engineering, joined the U of A in March as a special advisor to Díaz de la Rubia and serves as the university’s strategic architect for fusion initiatives.

“The U of A offers a wide range of expertise, particularly in optical sciences, engineering and materials science. It’s a strong environment for launching initiatives aimed at tackling the challenges on the way to commercialization of fusion energy,” Hahn said, noting that only a small number of U.S. universities are actively involved in advancing fusion research.

U of A researchers’ collaborations with hub members will largely concentrate on engineering hurdles and scaling. Although experiments have demonstrated IFE’s promise as a safe and sustainable energy source, significant technological breakthroughs are still required before a fusion power plant can become operational, Hahn explained.

One significant challenge in advancing IFE stems from its reliance on powerful lasers to create extreme heat and pressure within a fuel capsule containing hydrogen isotopes. The lasers are energized by arrays of laser diodes – semiconductor devices that amplify their intensity. Several advances in diode technology must occur to make large-scale, cost-effective power generation feasible. Enhanced manufacturing processes and packaging, as well as testing for reliability and lifespan, will reduce diode cost and increase production rates.

“This requires collaboration among experts across diverse disciplines, as well as active exchange between industry, national labs and academia,” Hahn said.

Together with Tucson-based STARFIRE Hub participant Leonardo Electronics US Inc. and other industry partners, the U of A is exploring the possibility of building a diode-pumped laser research and training facility.

Component manufacturing is one of several fusion ecosystem issues STARFIRE Hub members are addressing. They’re also preparing and training the specialized workforce needed to build and nurture the industry.

Hub membership provides university researchers and faculty with opportunities to develop and share emerging knowledge. Hahn also anticipates that Arizona students will benefit from STARFIRE’s educational offerings, including a graduate-level online course scheduled to launch in January 2026.",https://research.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2025-09/LLNLlasers_Herocard.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 20:59:40.853760

The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, it was the largest climate bill in U.S. history, with major incentives for electric vehicle production and adoption. In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world — especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars — especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions — it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built — and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A virtuous — or vicious — cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector — eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes — is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition — it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors — power generation and transportation — while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

Wave power project comes online at Port of LA

That’s what Eco Wave Power wants to demonstrate. On Tuesday, it launched a two-year pilot project at the Port of Los Angeles, becoming the United States’ first on-shore wave energy program.

How it works

It’s a simple model: Seven blue floats that look like little boats are attached to the side of a dock. They bob with the waves, pushing a hydraulic cylinder that sends fluid through pipes into bright red tanks housed in a converted shipping container. Pressure builds in the tanks, turns a motor and powers a generator. Right now, it’s enough energy to power 100 households, said Inna Braverman, co-founder and chief executive of Eco Wave Power.

The control hub for the project is inside a shipping container.

Inside the container are the tanks, gauges and other equipment that produce the electricity.

The hope is to install these floats along 8 miles of breakwater off San Pedro — that would produce enough energy for up to 60,000 households, she said. The company, which partnered with the nonprofit AltaSea, has a two-year agreement with the Port of Los Angeles to run the pilot.

“The goal of this project is to be a demonstration … to show that it doesn’t harm the marine environment, [that] we’re not connected to the seabed, to show how to create the regulatory framework for it,” Braverman said Tuesday at a dockside ribbon cutting for the project.

She said wave energy, which is still an emerging technology, has been done in the middle of the ocean, but creating on-shore stations is more cost effective. Building the pilot project cost about $1 million, she said — half of it funded by Shell.

This type of new technology will help the port get to zero emissions over the next decade, said Michael Galvin, director of waterfront and commercial real estate at the Port of Los Angeles.

“ We have to scale up the energy grid capacity that we have here in the port,” he said.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c8063b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+580/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F77%2F49%2F483576d64286a905b549af2f086b%2Fimg-6945.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 20:02:34.904320

Last month, the small, predominantly Black town of Roseland, Louisiana, where an estimated 90% of the children live in extreme poverty, endured an environmental disaster. In Capital B, Adam Mahoney documented the incident. On August 22nd, ""a catastrophic explosion erupted at Smitty's Supply, a major lubricant manufacturing facility,"" causing oil and soot to rain down on the nearby area. It was a dystopian scene for residents to witness a black, oily substance falling from the sky instead of rainwater. Photos showed homes, cars, and clothing stained with black debris. Tangipahoa Parish residents posted images of the substance in marshlands and bodies of water throughout the area. Members of a local Facebook gardening group shared their disappointment and concern, showing photos of soot on their plants.

The tragedy in Roseland is part of a broader problem, as Black people are more likely to live in communities with polluted air, water, and soil. While some would dismiss this as simply a poor luck of the draw, these racial disparities are reflective of the long-term consequences of racially discriminatory policies, such as racial redlining and restrictive covenants. The explicitly racist policies of the past have created a stubbornly segregated society. And as Richard and Leah Rothstein wrote in ""Just Action,"" there was ""no separation of equals: black neighborhoods are under-resourced and more impoverished than white neighborhoods."" With less social, economic, and political power, Black residents have been traditionally left out of the loop, deprived of an equal opportunity in community planning. As a result, they are often left to bear the brunt of toxic exposure.

But Tesla’s ambitions as an EV maker are shrinking as it pursues artificial intelligence — and faces the reality of a decreasing share of the car market.

Tesla’s vehicles made up only 38 percent of U.S. electric vehicle sales in August, according to data from Cox Automotive that was first reported by Reuters. Five years ago, Tesla sold more than 80 percent of America’s EVs.

Recent declines have been sharpest, tracking Musk’s plunging political popularity after leading President Donald Trump’s government-slashing efforts. As recently as May, Tesla sold more than half of U.S. EVs.

Meanwhile, Tesla recently released two milestone documents: a new master plan and a new proposed pay package for Musk. Neither puts electric vehicles in the foreground.

Musk’s pay package, which Tesla’s board unveiled last week and still needs investor approval, lays out the goals that Musk must hit to earn a titanic $1 trillion in the next decade.

It includes stretch goals in industries that, for now, barely exist.

For example, Musk could meet his targets by selling 1 million Optimus robots or putting 1 million robotaxis on the road. Both goals are difficult because, unlike when it began selling EVs, Tesla has serious competitors; it trails Waymo in robotaxi deployment, and other firms are developing humanoid robots.

Mounting competition

Musk’s target for EVs — to deliver a total of 20 million vehicles — at first seems ambitious. But it is a shadow of his former goal. As recently as two years ago, Musk was promising that by 2030, Tesla would deliver 20 million vehicles each year.

Meeting the objective over a decade would only require Tesla to moderately accelerate its historic pace. In 2024, Tesla delivered almost 1.8 million vehicles worldwide.

Even that could be a stretch, though, as Tesla contends with rising EV competition.

In China, domestic automakers are producing EVs that are less expensive than Tesla’s and feature more advanced tech. In the U.S., traditional rivals are making inroads. While Tesla’s market share declined in August, U.S. EV sales were at a record monthly high of 147,000, equating to 10 percent of all new-car sales.

Analysts are predicting that the U.S. EV market will brake in October. That is the date when the $7,500 federal EV tax credit will end because of the megabill that Republicans passed this summer.

The agenda of the president that Musk helped get elected could mean fewer Teslas sold.

The road less traveled

Tesla’s Master Plan Part IV, also released last week, is already describing EVs in the past tense. It calls EVs “the foundation for this technological renaissance,” while painting a future that includes robots and robotaxis and, more vaguely, “building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world.”

Despite those lofty targets, Tesla’s main product is still electric vehicles. Auto sales made up almost three-quarters of revenue last quarter.

“Electric vehicles barely get mentioned, which is a red flag,” wrote the investing site Motley Fool in an analysis of the new master plan. “Tesla shareholders should carefully consider whether this new road is one they want to travel.”

Trump undermines New England’s energy outlook

President Donald Trump’s assault on offshore wind is blowing up New England’s plans to meet rising energy demand and cut planet-warming emissions, writes Garrett Downs.

The Trump administration has halted a nearly complete project off Rhode Island’s coast, sought to revoke a permit for a Massachusetts project and paused offshore wind leases. New England officials have emphasized that such projects are crucial for grid reliability, and they’re scrambling for alternatives.

Both Maine and Massachusetts are now looking into getting electricity from planned offshore wind projects in Canada.

“We’re closely tracking the development of offshore wind in Canada and considering how regional efforts may deliver reliable, affordable power, modern infrastructure, and broad economic benefits for Maine,” said a spokesperson in the Maine governor’s energy office.

Rick Perry’s company wants DOE loan

A company founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry is looking to Wall Street and DOE’s loan office to help fund a massive nuclear and gas complex to fuel artificial intelligence, Christa Marshall writes.

Fermi America on Monday filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, offering further details on its plans to build one of the world’s biggest data center complexes near Amarillo, Texas.

The company says it is on track to produce a gigawatt of power by the end of next year. Ultimately, Fermi plans to use a combination of nuclear and gas to produce 11 gigawatts of electricity.

“We believe the Trump Administration’s renewed focus on expedited permitting and the expansion of nuclear infrastructure in the United States presents a favorable backdrop for Fermi to replicate its business model,” the filing said.

An industry-friendly approach to insurance risk

Louisiana’s insurance commissioner has spent time with the reinsurers who pay a share of property claims after major disasters, seeking areas of cooperation to keep the state insurance market stable as extreme weather’s toll increases, Saqib Rahim writes.

Tim Temple’s meetings revealed concerns about roof quality in Louisiana. In response, the state Legislature passed a half-dozen bills related to issues Temple raised, including tax incentives for storm-hardened roofs.

The industry-friendly approach to insurance has spurned criticism that Temple is more interested in insurers than the insured. Temple says his approach is the same for other industries that do business in the state.

EIA expects U.S. drivers will spend the smallest share of their disposable income on gasoline since 2005

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. drivers will spend less than 2% of their personal disposable incomes on gasoline in 2025—the lowest share since 2005, excluding 2020. In its September Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), EIA forecasts significant decreases in oil and gasoline prices this year, consistent with its previous forecasts.

“The good news for consumers is that we are generally seeing lower prices at the pump, and we expect gasoline prices to keep trending lower through next year,” said EIA Acting Administrator Steve Nalley.

U.S. energy market indicators 2024 2025 2026 Brent crude oil spot price (dollars per barrel) $81 $68 $51 Retail gasoline price (dollars per gallon) $3.30 $3.10 $2.90 U.S. crude oil production (million barrels per day) 13.2 13.4 13.3 Natural gas price at Henry Hub (dollars per million British thermal units) $2.20 $3.50 $4.30 U.S. liquefied natural gas gross exports (billion cubic feet per day) 12 15 16 Shares of U.S. electricity generation Natural gas 42% 40% 40% Coal 16% 17% 16% Renewables 23% 24% 26% Nuclear 19% 18% 18% U.S. GDP (percentage change) 2.8% 1.7% 2.4% U.S. CO2 emissions (billion metric tons) 4.8 4.9 4.8

Note: Values in this table are rounded and may not match values in other tables in this report.

Highlights from the September STEO include:

Global oil prices: EIA continues to expect significantly lower oil prices in the near term. The STEO forecast shows the Brent crude oil price falling from $68 per barrel in August to average $59 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2025 and around $50 per barrel in early 2026. OPEC+ leads global growth in oil production in EIA’s forecast, which should result in growing inventories of oil and petroleum products. Those higher inventories pushed prices down in EIA’s forecast.

Gasoline prices and expenditures:EIA expects the U.S. average retail price for regular-grade gasoline to be about $3.10 per gallon this year and $2.90 per gallon in 2026. EIA expects in 2025, U.S. drivers’ gasoline expenditures as a share of disposable personal income are likely to be the lowest since at least 2005—excluding 2020. EIA estimates expenditures will average less than 2% of disposable income this year, down from an average 2.4% over the previous decade.

Natural gas prices: EIA expects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price will rise from an average of $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August to $3.70/MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2025 and $4.30/MMBtu next year.

Hydrocarbon production: With rising natural gas prices and falling oil prices, EIA expects drilling activity in the United States will be more centered in natural gas-intensive producing regions in 2026. EIA forecasts the price difference between crude oil and natural gas prices next year will be the lowest since 2005. In EIA’s forecast, U.S. natural gas production remains relatively flat next year, but crude oil production declines by about 1% compared with this year.

Electricity prices: EIA expects the average residential price of electricity in the United States will increase from 16.5 cents per kilowatthour in 2024 to about 17.9 cents per kilowatthour in 2026. The rising natural gas price is a key driver of rising retail electricity prices in EIA’s forecast because natural gas is the top source of U.S. electricity generation.

Electricity generation: Electricity generation has been growing rapidly this year as a result of growing demand for power from data centers and industrial customers. EIA expects total U.S. generation by the electric power sector will grow by 2.3% in 2025 and a further 3.0% next year. Solar power accounts for most of the increase in generation in both 2025 and 2026 in EIA’s forecast.

The strategic move alongside new upgrades has drivers excited. The automaker's latest car is making EV ownership more accessible while being eco-conscious.

Electrek reported that Toyota's new 2026 bZ electric SUV is replacing its bZ4X model. The successor is bringing a host of improvements.

The redesign makes it a stylish and unique ride. A higher range gives better mileage per charge. Its built-in North American Charging Standard port allows recharging at Tesla Superchargers.

With these enhancements, the bZ starts at $34,900.

The base XLE FWD trim on a 57.7-kilowatt-hour battery offers 236 miles of range. The extended-range XLE FWD Plus trim reaches up to 314 miles of driving range on a larger 74.7-kilowatt-hour battery.

The price, range, and performance make the 2026 Toyota bZ a compelling option. Toyota anticipates its new EV will arrive at dealerships in the second half of 2025.

An affordable, high-performing EV is excellent news for consumers and the planet.

EV owners spend about 60% less on ""fuel"" each year compared to gasoline vehicles. They benefit from less frequent and costly maintenance, plus no oil changes. Features like large touchscreens and fast charging can make driving easier and enjoyable.

Installing solar panels also increases the cost savings of EV ownership. Solar energy is cheaper than using public charging stations or relying on the grid. EnergySage compares quotes from vetted local installers to save up to $10,000 on solar power.

Some have noted the environmental impact of EV battery manufacturing and mineral extraction. Roughly 30 million tons of minerals are used each year for the clean energy transition.

In comparison, this is less than the 16.5 billion tons of dirty fuels we currently dig out of the Earth each year. These burned and lost dirty fuels do more damage, while EV battery minerals are reusable.

A study from MIT showed the difference between gas-powered and electric cars.

Internal combustion engines create an average of 350 grams of carbon air pollution. This value was per mile over the car's lifetime. EVs on an average U.S. power grid produce only 200 grams.

A Tesla Model 3 makes up for its environmental costs compared to a Toyota Corolla after 13,500 miles.

In separate federal court filings, the administration said recently it was reconsidering approvals for three other wind farms: the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind.
Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5 percent of the region’s electricity needs.
Rhode Island already has one offshore facility: the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.
Rhode Island and Connecticut have said that halting construction of Revolution Wind would harm the states, their residents, investments and the offshore wind industry.","PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Connecticut, Rhode Island and the developer of an offshore wind farm that would power 350,000 homes in the two states said Thursday that they’re suing the Trump administration for stopping the nearly completed project.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha accused President Donald Trump of waging an “all-out assault” on the wind energy industry. The states’ lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, describes the Revolution Wind project as a “cornerstone” of their clean energy future, abruptly halted by federal officials without “statutory authority, regulatory justification or factual basis.”

Danish energy company Orsted filed a separate suit in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., also arguing that the administration lacks the legal authority to block the Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it would seek a preliminary injunction that would allow it to advance the project, which is 80 percent complete, with all underwater foundations and 45 of 65 turbines installed.

Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace said Thursday that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Work on the project was paused Aug. 22 when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order for what it said were national security concerns. They were not specified.

Trump has demonstrated hostility to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind. He has prioritized fossil fuels for electricity. Revolution Wind is the second major wind project that his administration ordered to stop. Work on the first, an offshore wind project for New York, was later allowed to resume.

In separate federal court filings, the administration said recently it was reconsidering approvals for three other wind farms: the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind. Combined, those projects could power nearly 2.5 million homes in Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island with clean electricity.

Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats representing Massachusetts, said Trump and his Cabinet “need to end their war on American energy and jobs.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told CNN that he’s concerned offshore wind turbines distort radar detection systems, which could give cover to a bad actor to “launch a swarm drone attack through a wind farm.”

Retired U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold called that a “specious and false narrative” pushed by someone with an “overactive imagination in search of a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.”

Lippold was commanding the USS Cole when al-Qaida attacked it in a Yemeni port in 2000.

If drones get so close to U.S. shores to be near a wind farm without being detected by the military, he said, “we have had a massive intelligence — a national security — failure.”

U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and national security expert, has also disputed the administration’s rationale, pointing to the Defense Department’s involvement in reviewing the project.

When the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved Revolution Wind in 2023, the agency said it consulted with the Defense Department at each stage of the regulatory process for the lease area assigned to the wind farm. The DOD concluded that with some site-specific stipulations, any impacts to its training and activities in the wind energy area would be “negligible and avoidable,” according to the record of decision.

The state and federal reviews took about nine years.

Trump and several Cabinet members repeatedly slammed wind power as ugly and expensive during a recent meeting. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talked about the failure of a massive wind turbine blade at a different offshore wind farm under construction off Nantucket, Massachusetts.

Fiberglass fragments of a blade from the Vineyard Wind project broke apart and began washing ashore last summer during the peak of tourist season. Manufacturer GE Vernova agreed to pay $10.5 million in a settlement to compensate island businesses that suffered losses due to the blade failure.

“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5 percent of the region’s electricity needs.

Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island already has one offshore facility: the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Rhode Island and Connecticut have said that halting construction of Revolution Wind would harm the states, their residents, investments and the offshore wind industry. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, and Connecticut committed over $200 million to redevelop State Pier in New London to support the industry.

The states said they’re counting on Revolution Wind electricity, particularly in the winter, when demand in New England spikes and natural gas is prioritized for heating. The power would cost 9.8 cents per kilowatt-hour, locked in for 20 years. That’s cheaper than the average projected cost of energy in New England.

The head of Connecticut’s top environmental and energy agency, Katie Dykes, predicts it will cost the state’s electricity ratepayers tens of millions of dollars if the wind project doesn’t come online.

According to a report by the global energy think tank Ember, China is leading the world in clean-energy industries and “creating the conditions for a decline in fossil fuel use.” The country has made strong efforts to sell solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines globally. Since 2010, the cost of these technologies has dropped significantly, between 60 percent and 90 percent. Due to this significant price decrease, poorer countries have been able to implement renewable energy systems. Richard Black, the report’s editor, said, “China is the engine, and it is changing the energy landscape not just domestically but in countries across the world.” Despite leading the world in renewable energy production, China remains the top user of fossil fuels, burning more coal than Europe and the U.S. combined. Companies committed to clean energy should look to ESG solutions for guidance.

Africa’s largest hydroelectric dam begins operations in Ethiopia

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was officially launched on Tuesday. Located on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, the $5 billion dam is the largest hydroelectric dam in Africa. Construction of the dam began in 2011, and its first turbine was powered up in 2022. On Tuesday, it finally reached its maximum power output of 5,150 megawatts (MW). The dam will improve access to electricity across Ethiopia, while also providing irrigation for regions downstream. Egypt fears that the GERD will limit Egypt’s water supply, especially during periods of drought. Nevertheless, Ethiopia has argued that the dam will not negatively affect countries downstream. No major disruptions have been recorded since operations began in 2020.

Development banks provided $137 billion in climate finance in 2024

Multilateral development banks released a report Tuesday showing a record $137 billion in climate financing in 2024, 10% more than in 2023. As the world prepares for the COP30 talks in Brazil this November, investments have increased. Nancy Saich, the chief climate change expert at the European Investment Bank, said, “We hope that by showing that our finance is flowing, this encourages countries to come with ambitious national climate plans to the COP (because) overall, we’re not yet on track to a safe world, and a safe temperature.” The majority of these green investments, around $85.1 billion, went to poorer nations, with $58.8 billion being allocated to renewable energy and other climate change mitigation projects. Corporations focused on sustainable investing should use ESG tools to track their investments.

Lack of energy accessibility hinders EU’s energy transition progress

A new report by the Center for the Study of Democracy think tank claimed that Europeans are paying far more for their energy needs than they would in the U.S. or China. The analysis comes a year after the publication of a report by former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. The Draghi report found that expensive power and gas throughout the EU were hindering the region’s competitiveness. Martin Vladimirov, one of the authors of the new report, said, “A year after Draghi called for stronger EU energy markets, our data shows affordability risks remain high, with retail prices still 40–70 percent above pre-crisis levels in much of Central and Eastern Europe.” As the EU proceeds into the next phase of the energy transition, affordability is key in ensuring the bloc’s success.

Commonwealth LNG Signs 20-Year Sale and Purchase Agreement with EQT Corporation

édité le 09/09/2025

Commonwealth LNG (Commonwealth) announced has signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT), one of the largest natural gas producers in the United States. The agreement provides for the sale of 1 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG for 20 years from Commonwealth’s 9.5 Mtpa export facility currently under development on the Gulf Coast in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement, EQT will purchase LNG on a free-on-board basis at a price indexed to Henry Hub. The definitive agreement marks a significant milestone in both companies’ efforts to deliver responsibly sourced, low emission natural gas to international markets.

“The agreement with EQT is a strong endorsement of our integrated natural gas platform, featuring a unique wellhead-to-water strategy that meets burgeoning demand for LNG across global markets, while advancing U.S. energy leadership and economic growth,” said Ben Dell, Managing Partner of Kimmeridge and Chairman of Caturus, the parent company of Commonwealth LNG. “By combining EQT’s scale and Commonwealth’s efficient modular LNG design, we’re delivering a differentiated solution for global energy buyers.”

“The signing of this agreement with Commonwealth LNG adds to the incredible momentum we are building in the LNG market and further strengthens EQT’s position as a leading force in connecting U.S. natural gas to global demand,” said Toby Z. Rice, President and CEO of EQT.

Commonwealth is advancing toward a final investment decision (FID) in 2025, with first LNG production expected in 2029. Inclusive of the agreement with EQT, Commonwealth has 5 Mtpa of offtake under long-term, binding agreement (Glencore, JERA and PETRONAS), with line of sight to subscribe its remaining capacity. These foundational contracts demonstrate international confidence in the project’s execution and value proposition.

The SPA will become fully effective upon the satisfaction of customary conditions, including an affirmative final investment decision on the project.

A potential shift to Donald Trump's industrial policies introduces a distinct set of scenarios.","The Biden administration's ambitious push to revitalize domestic manufacturing through historic investments faces a perplexing contradiction: a recent contraction in factory employment. Despite massive legislative efforts aimed at boosting American production and strengthening supply chains, the nation's factories have shed jobs, raising questions about the efficacy of current industrial policies and the long-term health of the sector. This paradox highlights the complex interplay of automation, global economic headwinds, and the nuanced impact of government intervention, all while setting the stage for a potentially dramatic shift should a new administration, particularly one led by Donald Trump, reintroduce a different set of industrial policies focused on broad tariffs and deregulation.

This unexpected downturn in manufacturing employment, even as significant private investments pour into new factories, signals a potential disconnect between policy intentions and labor market realities. The immediate implication is a sobering reminder that simply incentivizing new facilities does not automatically translate into a proportional increase in traditional factory jobs. For the broader economy, it raises concerns about the quality of job growth, the impact on working-class communities, and the nation's true manufacturing competitiveness on the global stage.

A Stuttering Revival: Factory Employment Contraction Amidst Policy Zeal

The Biden administration has championed a vigorous ""Made in America"" agenda, underpinning it with landmark legislation designed to spur a domestic manufacturing renaissance. The CHIPS and Science Act poured billions into semiconductor production, while the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offered substantial incentives for clean energy, electric vehicles, and battery manufacturing. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law further bolstered demand for American-made materials. These policies have indeed stimulated an impressive wave of private sector commitments, with over $1 trillion in announced investments since January 2021, and contributing to the addition of over 775,000 manufacturing jobs since the start of the administration.

However, despite these efforts, recent data reveals a concerning trend of job losses. Manufacturers in the US shed 12,000 jobs in August 2025, contributing to a total loss of 42,000 manufacturing jobs since April 2025. Over the past year ending August 2025, manufacturing employment has declined by nearly 80,000, marking the longest stretch of losses since 2020. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) US Manufacturing PMI, a key barometer of activity, also indicated a sixth straight month of contraction in August 2025, with employment continuing to fall. Most of these job losses have occurred in the durable goods sector, encompassing industries like automotive, household appliances, and electronics. This contraction appears to be a consequence of multiple factors, including intensified automation, broader economic uncertainties, slowed consumer demand, high interest rates, and the lingering effects of tariffs which can increase input costs for manufacturers.

The timeline of these events shows a dual narrative: robust policy initiatives generating significant investment announcements on one hand, and a simultaneous struggle to sustain or grow factory employment on the other. Key stakeholders include the White House, federal agencies like the Department of Commerce and Department of Energy, and major industry players across the semiconductor, clean energy, and automotive sectors. Initial market reactions have been mixed; while investment in specific high-tech areas remains strong due to policy incentives, the broader manufacturing sentiment, as reflected by the ISM PMI, suggests caution and uncertainty regarding the overall health of the sector. This indicates that while capital is being deployed to build future capacity, the present labor market dynamics in manufacturing are challenging.

Shifting Sands: Who Wins and Who Loses?

The current policy environment under the Biden administration has created clear beneficiaries, particularly in strategic high-tech sectors. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been a significant recipient of CHIPS Act funding, securing $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in federal loans for expanding its operations across multiple states. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM), despite its foreign origin, received up to $6.6 billion for its Arizona facilities, while GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) have also secured substantial support. Companies like Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) and LAM Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX), which provide critical equipment for chip manufacturing, stand to gain from increased domestic production. In the clean energy and EV space, First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR), Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) have announced major investments, citing the IRA's tax credits as crucial enablers.

Conversely, the broader manufacturing sector, particularly those not directly benefiting from targeted subsidies or those heavily reliant on global supply chains for components, has experienced headwinds. Manufacturers expressing concerns about increased federal regulations and higher compliance costs fall into this category. The general contraction in manufacturing employment suggests that while specific companies are thriving, others are reducing headcount, particularly in sectors like Transportation Equipment, Computer & Electronic Products, and Electrical Equipment. Companies that struggle to automate efficiently or face intense international competition without direct government support may find themselves on the losing side.

A potential shift to former President Trump's industrial policies would likely reorder this landscape. Trump's approach emphasizes broad tariffs, significant deregulation, and an ""America First"" stance. Semiconductor companies that have benefited from CHIPS Act grants might face uncertainty, as direct federal spending could be curtailed in favor of broader tax incentives. Clean energy and EV companies heavily reliant on IRA subsidies could see those benefits reduced or eliminated, potentially slowing down domestic investment in these areas. On the other hand, domestic manufacturers that directly compete with foreign imports, such as some tool shops, could see a boost from increased tariffs, making their products more competitive. Companies burdened by current regulations might also benefit from deregulation efforts. However, manufacturers reliant on imported materials and global supply chains, especially in sectors like the automotive industry, could face increased production costs due to widespread tariffs on components, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and supply chain disruptions. The shift could favor more traditional, lower-tech manufacturing sectors over the advanced, high-tech industries currently being prioritized.

Industry Tectonic Shifts and Global Repercussions

The current contradiction in U.S. manufacturing—robust investment announcements juxtaposed with declining factory employment—is symptomatic of broader, long-term industry trends. Primarily, it underscores the relentless march of automation and advanced manufacturing technologies. While the administration's policies aim to boost output, modern factories, equipped with AI, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT), often require fewer human workers to achieve higher levels of production. This technological evolution drives increased efficiency and competitiveness, but it simultaneously exacerbates the challenge of job displacement for traditional manufacturing roles, creating a ""skills mismatch"" that policy incentives alone cannot quickly resolve. The automotive industry, for example, has seen significant reductions in human labor due to automation.

The second major trend is the ongoing restructuring of global supply chains. Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have accelerated a strategic pivot towards resilience, reshoring, and nearshoring. Biden's industrial policies actively support this by incentivizing domestic production in critical sectors like semiconductors, electric batteries, and pharmaceuticals, aiming to reduce reliance on overseas suppliers, particularly China. This push has ripple effects: while it aims to strengthen domestic industries, it can be viewed by trade partners and competitors as protectionist, potentially leading to disputes, as seen with European countries previously threatening retaliatory tariffs against U.S. industrial policies. Historically, the U.S. has often criticized other nations for subsidizing their industries, and similar actions here could complicate its stance on promoting a ""rules-based"" global order.

Regulatory and policy implications are profound. The current administration's approach represents a significant departure from decades of free-market orthodoxy, marking a robust return to government intervention to shape the economy. This includes targeted public spending, grants, loans, and tax incentives. Historically, the U.S. has a rich tradition of industrial policy, from Alexander Hamilton's advocacy for tariffs and subsidies in the early republic to Henry Clay's ""American System"" in the 19th century, which saw high protectionist tariffs help industries like iron and steel flourish. Manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 and has been on a general decline since, with major drops in the early 2000s due to globalization and automation. The current efforts build on renewed interest in industrial policy, last seen in the Obama and Trump administrations, making it the most significant program in decades. The broader significance lies in the attempt to strategically rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity and resilience, reshaping global trade relations and the very nature of work in the American economy.

The Road Ahead: Navigating Uncertainty and Opportunity

The trajectory of U.S. manufacturing in the coming years will be shaped by a confluence of short-term recovery efforts and long-term strategic shifts, all under the shadow of potential policy changes. In the short term (2025-2026), moderate growth is anticipated, driven by easing financial pressures and continued investments in reshoring and advanced technologies. Industries like defense, renewable energy, and semiconductors are poised for expansion, leveraging the significant capital injected by current legislation. However, this growth remains uneven, facing challenges from persistent labor shortages, inflationary pressures, and the need for continuous technological adoption to enhance productivity.

Looking further ahead, the long-term vision for U.S. manufacturing aims for leadership in advanced technologies such as 3D printing, smart factories, AI, and data analytics. This includes a strong emphasis on sustainable manufacturing, driven by the global demand for low-carbon technologies and the incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. Both companies and the government face critical strategic pivots. Companies must aggressively embrace technology, diversify their supply chains beyond ""just-in-time"" models, and invest heavily in workforce development to bridge the skills gap. Government, in turn, needs to maintain sustained industrial policies, continue targeted investments and incentives, and streamline regulations while fostering a comprehensive national manufacturing strategy to provide long-term guidance.

A potential shift to Donald Trump's industrial policies introduces a distinct set of scenarios. While a renewed focus on broad tariffs (e.g., a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, potentially 60% on Chinese goods) and significant deregulation might offer perceived benefits to domestic manufacturers competing directly with imports, it also carries substantial risks. These include increased production costs for industries reliant on global supply chains, potential retaliatory tariffs from trading partners leading to trade wars, and a possible dampening of overall economic growth. Analyses suggest that past tariff regimes have led to job losses in some manufacturing sectors by raising input costs. Such a shift might also redirect focus away from the high-tech, clean energy sectors currently prioritized, potentially favoring lower-tech manufacturing. The outcome could range from an optimistic scenario of sustained, targeted growth under current policies, to protectionist headwinds under a Trump administration leading to mixed results, or even stagnation if fundamental challenges like labor shortages and global competition are not effectively addressed.

Forging the Future: A Concluding Assessment

The current state of American manufacturing presents a profound paradox: substantial government investment and private sector commitments aimed at revitalization, yet coupled with a recent contraction in factory employment. This contradiction underscores that while industrial policy can stimulate investment in new capacity, it faces an uphill battle against long-term trends like automation-driven productivity gains and the ongoing restructuring of global supply chains. The Biden administration's strategy is undeniably ambitious, driving significant capital into high-tech sectors like semiconductors and clean energy, which are crucial for future economic competitiveness and national security.

Moving forward, the market will assess not just the volume of investment, but its impact on the quantity and quality of jobs, and the genuine strengthening of domestic supply chains. The sector's resilience will depend on its ability to attract and train a skilled workforce capable of operating advanced manufacturing technologies. Investors should closely watch for continued signs of investment in advanced manufacturing, the effectiveness of workforce development programs, and the responsiveness of companies to supply chain diversification. The upcoming political cycle, particularly the potential for a return to Trump-era industrial policies characterized by broad tariffs, will introduce significant policy uncertainty, potentially altering the landscape of winners and losers and challenging the current administration's strategic manufacturing focus. The ultimate success of American manufacturing will hinge on a delicate balance between fostering innovation, protecting domestic industries, and navigating the complexities of a highly interconnected global economy.",https://images.financialcontent.com/investcenter/favicon.svg,N,,2025-09-09 19:04:07.999127

A recent ruling by the International Court of Justice affirmed that policies promoting fossil fuel developments are out of step with international environmental legal obligations to avoid significant cross-border harms.","U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright is in Europe this week to lobby for oil and gas, and some European policy experts say his pro-fossil fuel arguments are based on disinformation, including a misleading climate report his department published this summer.

On September 9 and 10, Wright is visiting the GasTech conference in Milan, Italy, to participate in a fireside chat and press conference and then traveling on to European Union headquarters in Brussels and to Vienna for the annual conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

In a press release, the U.S. Department of Energy touted the trip as a chance “to strengthen long-lasting partnerships and encourage countries to join the United States as President Trump builds an energy secure and prosperous future.”

A report, released by the department in July, downplayed the deadly impacts of global warming and ignored the overwhelming scientific consensus on the need to cut fossil fuel emissions. Dozens of climate scientists concluded that the report was “fundamentally incorrect.”

European climate experts are wary of the U.S. government’s pro-fossil fuel policies and said they doubted the efforts by Wright would result in any significant changes to European climate and energy policy.

“I think it’s very easy to say that what the current U.S. government is doing is de facto climate disinformation,” said Petter Lydén, head of international climate policy for Germanwatch, an independent development, environmental and human rights NGO. “I’m obviously coming from a European perspective, but it’s clear that what they’re saying is not true.”

For example, a growing European social and political narrative that U.S. fossil gas is “saving” Europe’s energy supply is flawed, German energy economist Claudia Kemfert and co-authors wrote in a peer-reviewed journal article published in late August. The narrative is based on misconceptions that lead to “highly controversial” overcapacities for fossil gas production and transport in both exporting and importing countries, the authors wrote, describing the U.S. attempts to keep growing the fossil gas bubble economy.

Climate disinformation isn’t about expressing an opinion. “In cases like this, it’s about power,” said Philip Newell, an information integrity expert with the Global Strategic Communications Council, a collaborative network of communications professionals in the fields of climate, energy and nature.

He said disinformation is “peer pressure or bullying. When you look at surveys of the public, the overwhelming majority want climate action, but when you ask them, everyone thinks only a minority of people want climate action,” he said.

He said the real impact of disinformation is not that it makes people think they are wrong, but that it can make them feel like they are alone. “Then, you don’t demand action because it feels like a losing cause instead of a popular one,” he said.

Unwelcome Intervention

Lydén, who has participated in global climate negotiations for more than 20 years, said the U.S. administration’s attempts to influence Europe’s climate and energy policies are “not a welcome intervention on this continent,” other than with some extremist political parties and a small number of countries pursuing fossil-fueled agendas similar to those of the current U.S. administration, he added.

“I just read that Chris Wright has been saying that countries in Europe should not pursue the transition, but instead join ‘Team Energy Freedom,’” he said. “We are not used to this simplistic, populist language … It may resonate with a few, but it’s dangerous. And it’s also condescending to European voters who debate these issues on a different level than in the U.S.”

The U.S. fossil fuel policy also resonates with the global fossil fuel industry, said Reinhard Steuerer, a political scientist and climate policy expert at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) in Vienna.

“Of course, Big Oil around the world is happy about climate denial ruling in the U.S., and about rolling back climate ambitions across Europe,” he said. That’s a rational business point of view because they are safeguarding their profits in the short term, he added.

“The problem is when not only powerful politicians, but also majorities fall for their lies, simply because it is the most convenient way out of our climate dilemma here and now,” he said. After decades studying the climate crisis, Steurer is convinced that the “toxic cocktail of profits and convenience through denial threatens our civilization as we know it, most likely sooner than we are able to imagine.”

Esther Bollendorff, the senior gas policy coordinator with Climate Action Network Europe, a large umbrella group of advocacy groups and other NGOs, said Wright’s European tour is “nothing more than a lobbying crusade” to try and lock Europe into fracked liquid fossil gas, a methane-intensive fuel widely banned across Europe.

Bollendorf said European Union officials expect Wright to pressure Europe to weaken core environmental laws, including some related to methane emissions.

“His visit is part of a broader U.S. effort to dismantle Europe’s Green Deal and roll back progressive climate and energy legislation,” she said. “After yet another summer of devastating climate disasters, the EU must hold the line and protect hard-won policies that cut fossil fuels.”

Reports and research from climate and energy watchdog groups and scientists indicate that while European countries have made some progress on decarbonization, they are just as stuck in a fading fossil energy paradigm as the United States.

A recent ruling by the International Court of Justice affirmed that policies promoting fossil fuel developments are out of step with international environmental legal obligations to avoid significant cross-border harms.

Any new additional development of fossil fuels will also make it nearly impossible to reach the Paris Agreement climate goals, according to the most recent emissions gap report from the United Nations Environmental Programme.

And with emissions still increasing, the global average temperature is expected to rise another 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit above the pre-industrial level by 2100, an increase that will make deadly heatwaves, floods and wildfires more frequent and intense.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2230983022-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 19:07:23.144873

In China, oil demand most likely peaked in 2021 and is now declining.

These promising developments weren’t born just out of concern for the well-being of the planet, nor did they emerge solely in response to climate science projections or global climate governance mandates. The rise of clean energy continues for a different reason: Clean technology drives down costs, creates economic opportunity and offers geopolitical freedom.

But to make the most of these forces, we need new approaches to global climate policy.

The Climate Geopolitics Era

Energy has always been at the center of state power. Long ago, human settlements gathered energy from the sun, predominantly in the form of biomass. Early states concentrated this energy as grain to build stores of economic, political and military power. Between the late 18th century and mid-19th century, the Industrial Revolution generated geopolitical power for the British Empire, but also created dependency on the coal supply chain, which had major choke points. The U.S. then led a global oil revolution on the back of wartime technological innovations, building a new financial and military hegemony. Power was concentrated in Western oil- and gas-producing countries. But the 1973 oil crisis exposed the risks of relying on foreign fuel, spurring investment in wind, solar, nuclear and geothermal.

Since then, science and advocacy awakened people to the threat of fossil-fuel-driven environmental catastrophe, creating a powerful global web of carbon accounting, decarbonization policy, diplomatic bargaining and technological advance. Yet it was naive to believe that this alone could transform a global energy system forged over centuries by war and empire.

Today, we have entered another historic epoch of change where geopolitics now drives climate action. The thermodynamic advantages of renewables and electric technologies are reconfiguring the global landscape of geopolitical power in three ways: through a competition to seize the economic opportunities in the energy transition, through a need for energy security and geopolitical autonomy in a more dangerous world, and through the effort to diversify economies to make them more resilient.

Green technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles have major thermodynamic advantages over fossil fuels, the drilling, extraction, refining and transportation of which result in expensive energy losses at every distribution and conversion point. Sunlight and wind, on the other hand, produce power with little ongoing cost and are available nearly everywhere. And manufacturing these technologies is scalable and repeatable, which means that producers can learn and improve iteratively.

Clean technologies aren’t just better for the environment — they’re increasingly more affordable and accessible in the long run, giving more countries a chance to achieve energy security and geopolitical autonomy. That is what’s driving clean energy’s adoption around the world, even in nations without strong climate agendas.

Global climate policy must adapt to this reality. The existing framework of legal and scientific imperatives, focused on precise emissions reduction targets, is not enough to sustain meaningful progress because it misses the true forces behind climate action today. Lasting change is more likely to come from strategies that directly confront international competition and try to channel it in productive directions.

The clean energy transition sparked an international competition to seize economic and geopolitical opportunities. China recognized this first and centered its geostrategic plans on new energy technology beginning in the 1990s. Now the competition is heating up; many governments are investing in green industrial policies to position their firms in global value chains.

The big Korean firms followed China into the solar and battery sectors later in the 2000s. The U.K. launched a wind industrial strategy in 2013. The European Battery Alliance was created in 2017 to reshore the battery supply chain and secure Europe’s industrial base. Indonesia launched a battery strategy in 2020. America was already well behind when it entered the global race with the climate-friendly Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. These policies have spurred the innovation and deployment necessary to advance the technologies for the future energy system.

Another geopolitical factor powering climate action is the push for energy security and autonomy. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, European nations realized the risks of relying on potential adversaries for critical energy supplies. Meanwhile, tension between China and the U.S. quickly spilled over into concerns about interdependency. As China worked to reduce its reliance on Western semiconductors, the U.S. worried about China’s control over supply chains for solar panels, battery components and critical minerals. China is now restricting the free flow of rare earths and other critical minerals, threatening to halt global automotive and aerospace assembly lines.

The risks of fossil fuel dependency were laid bare for Pakistan in 2022. As Europeans sought to get off Russian gas, they outbid Pakistan for liquified natural gas (LNG) contracts. The diverted gas triggered shortages and left Pakistan in a difficult position, which motivated investments in clean energy. Today, Pakistan has an LNG glut because it has rapidly deployed Chinese solar panels.

Similarly, Ethiopia banned foreign imports of vehicles with internal combustion engines last year. China supported the deal by setting up an electric vehicle assembly there. As a result, Ethiopia’s economy is decarbonizing: Imports of oil and gas products have been flat since 2019, while the economy grew 70%.

When countries like Pakistan and Ethiopia install renewables, they get a win-win: They avoid high-cost fossil fuels and conserve scarce foreign dollars.

States that had previously depended on fossil fuel exports are seeking to diversify their economies to make them more resilient. China’s electric vehicle boom is already reducing oil demand, and its next green industrial policy frontiers — trucking, shipping and aviation — will likely decrease it further. Recognizing an existential threat, the Gulf states are betting that they can use their capital to replicate their position in a new energy order and generate the free cash flow and geopolitical leverage they once got from fossil fuels. The UAE, for example, has invested in renewables in Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Senegal, South Africa, Uzbekistan and elsewhere. Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia have taken stakes in critical minerals projects.

This reflects the fact that the long-term outlook for oil demand may not be as good as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) maintains. OPEC’s own 2022 projections showed that oil demand would rise only 10%, peaking in 2035 before flattening out. OPEC later revised this estimate upward, saying there’s no peak in sight. But, as the International Energy Agency analysis shows, demand growth in 2024 was low.

In this era of climate geopolitics, we must ensure that other sectors of the global economy reach a point at which clean alternatives are about as cheap and convenient as incumbent technologies. We must also scale clean energy supply chains so that even as these technologies go mainstream, costs and geopolitical risks remain manageable. To make this happen, a coalition of countries must advance a new approach to climate cooperation that channels geopolitics into investment and technology coordination — a challenge that is complicated by America’s backsliding under Trump.

There are three opportunities to achieve this: reorienting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to align with geopolitical realities, organizing strategic green investment to build developing economies, and creating plurilateral climate clubs.

Reorienting The UNFCCC

The UNFCCC was established in 1992 as the central multilateral negotiating forum for global climate policy. While the dream that it would help create a binding legal framework for global emissions reductions never materialized, it has served an essential scientific, political and moral role. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement established the basic obligations and objectives of global climate action.

But the UNFCCC’s technical and legalistic procedures now seem out of date in a world where geopolitical competition and energy security drive climate action. To remain relevant, the convention must adapt with a new framework that places the structural transformation of economies via industrial policy at its center.

The UNFCCC’s current system asks countries to submit technical plans showing how they will cut greenhouse gas emissions. This foregrounds restrictive, incrementalist policy initiatives with limited impact. It also neglects the reality that decarbonization is fundamentally about achieving the structural transformation of energy systems in a competitive geopolitical landscape.

Instead, the UNFCCC should ask countries to show how they plan to make strategic investments as part of broader national plans for green development. This would mean identifying the economic opportunities arising from the clean energy transition and proposing ambitious investments to realize those plans. If a country aims to accelerate the clean energy transition, we now know that it needs to create a plan to invest in structural transformations that reward domestic firms. Innovative modeling techniques now allow these investments to be translated into emissions reductions, which wasn’t possible 30 years ago when the UNFCCC was created, or even 10 years ago when the Paris Agreement was struck.

This approach would ground the UNFCCC in the transformation of energy systems instead of the relatively abstract task of reducing emissions. It would not abandon emissions reduction goals, but rather embed them within a new political and economic frame for global climate action. If the UNFCCC fails to meet the moment and climate action proceeds according to geopolitics alone, we will lose this crucial moral, legal and scientific lever for global climate governance.

Organizing Strategic Green Investment

Sustaining meaningful climate action will require the mobilization of massive amounts of capital, especially in the developing world. To achieve this, we need a global vehicle for strategic investment in clean energy supply chains and manufacturing around the globe.

The world will not decarbonize at the pace necessary unless developing countries such as Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria feel that climate action secures their economic futures. Any truly global climate agenda is going to be contingent on strategic finance. The international system is full of funding vehicles, but most are not focused on supporting green industrial policy. We need a new institution, mechanism or program to bring together countries in the Global North and the Global South to identify areas where we can collaborate to build clean energy supply chains.

After the Second World War, it was primarily the American hegemon that led the construction of global public goods like the World Bank. But in this era, a critical mass of smaller countries will need to take on a collective leadership role. The EU, Japan, Korea, Canada and Australia will need to step up. Without U.S. leadership, these are the countries with the collective capital and policy influence to catalyze the development of global clean energy supply chains that benefit all.

Strategic investment in the Global South will also position these countries to secure the materials they need for their domestic manufacturing efforts while reducing their dependence on China and the U.S. The EU has already been experimenting with a global investment strategy through the Global Gateway and the Critical Raw Materials Act. These vehicles deploy strategic finance to deliver on the EU’s industrial strategy while creating economic opportunities in the receiving jurisdictions. The lessons learned from these vehicles could help inform a more ambitious program of co-investment.

A new strategic investment body must start with clear targets that identify priority supply chain segments. Then it will need to create a prioritized pipeline of joint international clean energy projects and mobilize the finance necessary to complete them on the right timescales. But members must go beyond investment to support the innovation policy and market formation necessary to build and scale new technologies, critical minerals and clean energy infrastructure.

This is the developing field of joint industrial policy in which countries work together to coordinate strategic investment and infrastructure development at the international level. Industrial policy is already recognized as central to advancing domestic climate solutions by providing supply-push policies, which boost the supply of innovative and cost-effective technologies, and demand-pull policies, which create secure markets for new products to ensure those technologies scale and become price-competitive.

On the supply side, countries should work together to build clean energy technology more effectively. This will mean sharing expertise on industrial policy design, coordinating research and development efforts, and aligning subsidy programs so they reinforce rather than undermine each other.

On the demand side, governments need to create reliable markets for clean technologies. They can do this by aligning public procurement, standardizing regulations across countries, offering pricing guarantees to make projects viable and using trade policies to level the playing field for domestic clean industries.

Creating Climate Clubs

Because strategic investment is needed to advance technologies and scale clean energy supply chains, countries need to address the specific problems that will arise in the sectors with highly calibrated policy mixes. This detailed work is hard to pull off in universal, multilateral forums like the UNFCCC, where every member has veto power. Instead, plurilateral climate clubs can build close cooperation at the sectoral level. This would enable small groups of states with shared decarbonization and industrial policy objectives to work together to integrate supply-push and demand-pull policies to secure markets in opportune areas like steel, critical minerals or rare earth magnets.

Climate clubs offer “club goods”: benefits for members who follow the rules, such as harmonized tariffs and subsidies, and who fulfill their obligations, such as contributing to pooled investment funds. The goal is to create a secure, self-sustaining market, driving deployment and causing costs to fall, like we’ve seen with renewables, electric vehicles and heat pumps. In 2023, a group of 45 countries launched a climate club to advance steel and cement decarbonization. The club is just now setting to work, but it has advanced a set of common principles that provide the foundation for North-North and North-South cooperation in the crucial heavy industry sector.

Though there are some promising initiatives and bilateral partnerships with these goals, we need to go further with sector-specific clubs for aviation, fertilizer, critical minerals and other areas where serious work is required to find and develop the potential thermodynamic advantages of net-zero alternatives. Critically, these clubs will need to bring together advanced and developing countries to forge collaborative supply chains for these emerging technologies. This could provide nations in the Global South with real opportunities to capture value, but must not be executed in an extractive fashion to transfer raw commodities from poor to rich countries to be processed into high-value materials.

A similar credit for electric vehicles ends this month, leading to a pickup in sales. Those in the solar industry said they see similar signs in increased demand.

But it still presents the industry with its biggest challenge yet. Essentially, the U.S. government currently pays 30% of the cost of a home system.

It’s a hot topic as solar leaders from Pennsylvania and across the country meet at a conference in Las Vegas. However, they said they aren’t hopeful they can convince Republicans in the White House and Congress to change their minds.

Some said soaring electric rates might, though.

“You don’t have to be a political scientist to know that when people’s electric bills go up, they get very unhappy,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of Solar Energy Industries Association. “And I think that the market will speak there, too. That market impact will create political pressure that politicians will have to deal with.”

Republicans who wanted to end the credits argued that government money subsidizing renewable energy could be better used for other purposes.

This year, Pennsylvania reached two gigawatts of installed solar generation across the state, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission said.

In collaboration with RML Group – one of the leading UK automotive innovation companies - a 34 kWHr battery pack using Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluid featuring proprietary Shell Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) Technology, has been developed which is capable of charging from 10% to 80% capacity in under 10 minutes. The thermal fluid reduces thermal stresses very significantly allowing much higher cell charging currents to be tolerated.

If utilised in a carefully designed lightweight and aerodynamic car operating with an economy of 10 km/kWHr, a charging rate of 24km per minute spent charging would be achieved - significantly higher than the typical 5km per minute currently attained by many existing BEV designs by optimising performance whilst significantly reducing the number and mass of components.

Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids are electrically non-conductive fluids, which facilitate excellent heat transfer by filling all of the interstitial spaces within the battery pack, maximising direct contact between the fluid and each battery cell. They accommodate the very high levels of heat generation associated with rapid charging, ensuring extraordinary consistency and control of temperatures across the pack whilst offering enhanced protection against adverse thermal events. The advanced thermal management technology on display in this collaborative project was developed to showcase compact battery pack designs that are elegant, cost-effective and less complex.

“As we celebrate World EV Day, we are thrilled to demonstrate that Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids can help to significantly improve battery thermal performance, paving the way towards higher charging efficiencies, enhanced safety, convenience and cost-effectiveness— to support the widespread adoption of BEVs demanded by legislative initiatives around the world,” said Jason Wong, Global Executive Vice President, Shell Lubricants.

“This evolution is a testament to our commitment to collaborative innovation towards enabling more value with less emissions - building on our experience in high-performance transformer oils, proprietary Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) technology, and single-phase immersion cooling fluids for data centres.”

The market for BEVs has grown significantly, with BEV sales increasing 14% in 2024 compared to 20231. From the Shell Recharge Survey, EVs in both Europe and USA are driven further than ICE vehicles with over 52% of EVs in Europe and USA driven over 15,000km a year vs 22% of non-EVs in Europe and 42% in USA. Yet, among those not driving an EV, over 44% in Europe, USA and China cite concerns about range anxiety or lack of public charging points2.

Robert Mainwaring, Shell’s lead engineer on the project, commented: “Consumers are in pursuit of better energy efficiency, longer driving range and faster charging. Our ambition within this project was to show how Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids can support significant reductions in charging time without compromising cell integrity and lifetime.

By embracing advanced thermal management solutions, we believe this will open the door to a new generation of more sustainable, efficient and cost-effective battery electric vehicle solutions.”

Immersive thermal management

Immersive cooling technologies using dielectric liquids have a long tradition in industrial applications and have been applied successfully in several areas, such as oil immersed transformer designs. Good dielectric properties are essential to prevent electric shorts as the fluid is directly in contact with high voltage electrical systems. Therefore, high specific electrical resistivity and high break down voltage are key to ensure reliable function of the electric system.

Shell has more than a century of experience in dielectric fluid development and production. Building on its extensive experience in dielectric fluids and GTL technology, Shell has more recently developed a range of Shell Immersion Cooling Fluids for use in single-phase immersion cooling systems for data centers, as well as the Shell EV-Plus Thermal Management (TM) range of products to meet and exceed latest requirements from automotive OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers, including battery pack and cell manufacturers. Shell recently acquired Panolin and MIDEL/MIVOLT to expand its portfolio, which now contains not only thermal fluids formulated with GTL technology that are biodegradable to varying degrees, but also natural and synthetic ester base oils. Together this establishes a comprehensive suite of solutions designed to meet diverse thermal management needs across a range of applications, including power transmission and distribution, data center cooling, and thermal management of EV batteries, electric motors, inverters and fast chargers.",https://www.shell.com/etc.clientlibs/amidala/clientlibs/theme-base/resources/favicon/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-09 18:05:07.154251

Whether you operate a global shipping fleet, manage a regional rail network, advance autonomous vehicles, or develop and finance airport expansions, understanding these cross-cutting trends is critical for strategic planning and risk management.

Resurgence of Tolling and User-Fee Models

Tolling and toll concession programs are making a strong comeback as states seek sustainable ways to fund transportation infrastructure. Georgia, Tennessee, Washington, and Oregon are now exploring or expanding toll projects, following the lead of Virginia, Indiana, and Illinois. Expect broader application of “user pays” principles, potentially impacting freight corridors, interstate bridges, and even urban arterials, requiring operators to reassess routing strategies, pricing, and long-term concession agreements.

Stricter “Buy America” Requirements Raising Costs

A longstanding manufactured products exemption under federal Buy America rules has been eliminated, extending domestic content requirements to a wider array of transportation projects. In an inflationary environment, this shift can significantly increase project costs, alter procurement timelines, and affect vendor eligibility. Stakeholders should evaluate supply chain readiness, explore compliance certifications early, and consider alternative contracting structures to mitigate cost escalation.

Shifting Ground on Emissions Standards and EV Viability

Legal and regulatory challenges to greenhouse gas restrictions and California’s vehicle emissions standards are reshaping the automotive and transit manufacturing landscape. While recent actions may temporarily ease domestic production of traditional vehicles, they also inject uncertainty into the business case for electric and connected/autonomous vehicles (EVs/CAVs). This uncertainty extends to supporting infrastructure such as charging and grid integration, potentially slowing investment and deployment schedules across the sector.

Economic Pressures Reshaping the Freight Sector

The volatile economics of the U.S. trucking industry, caused by the pandemic, recent U.S. trade policies, and fluctuating demand, have caused a downturn this year that has produced increased commercial legal disputes. Chief among these are claims for detention demurrage brought by ocean carriers and NVOCCs against a wide variety of consumers and connecting transportation and logistics service providers, including drayage operators and other motor carriers. While OSRA 2022 curbed much improper claim activity in this arena, many ancillary charge disputes predate that legislation. Equipment shortages and port congestion contribute to the environment. With 2025’s slump in industry economics, insolvencies and bankruptcies are on the rise, with service providers seeking to collect freight and other charges through litigation, often on dubious bases. This environment has also prompted industry players to explore restructuring as a strategy.

Federal Autonomous Vehicle Legislation Stalls; Administrative Action Fills the Gap

The federal push to create a unified national framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) has reached a legislative stalemate. Despite strong backing from the Administration and industry, proposed legislation to preempt the complex patchwork of state laws is unlikely to pass in the current Congress. Thus, the AV industry will continue to face regulatory uncertainty, requiring manufacturers, technology developers, and fleet operators to maintain a sharp focus on navigating varied and evolving state-level requirements.

Preemption AV Bills Face an Uphill Battle in Congress

Two significant bills were introduced this summer, but both efforts face significant opposition.

For commercial vehicles, the AMERICA DRIVES Act would prohibit states from requiring a human driver in a commercial AV. For passenger vehicles, the Autonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act of 2025 would update Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to permit the sale of vehicles designed without traditional human controls.

Proponents of these bills note that they are vital for U.S. economic competitiveness and supply chain modernization. However, a coalition of safety advocates, labor unions, and consumer groups has developed to oppose these bills. That opposition, combined with the history of failed AV legislation in prior sessions, makes it highly improbable that either bill will secure the votes needed.

Administrative Action Provides Limited Relief for Industry

Given the legislative gridlock, near-term federal support for AVs will continue to come from administrative actions rather than new legislation. The DOT and NHTSA are using their existing authority to support the industry, primarily by streamlining the Part 555 exemption process that allows for the deployment of a limited number of vehicles with novel designs that do not meet current FMVSS. On September 4, 2025, NHTSA also reiterated its intention to engage in rulemaking to amend several FMVSS as applied to automated vehicles with no manual controls.

Additionally, NHTSA’s Third Amended SGO on Crash Reporting became effective in June and reduced the immediate compliance burden on manufacturers by extending the timeline for initial serious incident reports (from one day to five) and eliminating mandatory monthly reporting when no incidents occur.

Given the continued legislative stalemate, the industry must continue to navigate various state laws while capitalizing on limited administrative actions to maintain momentum.

Rail Consolidation and Private Investment on the Rise

Private infrastructure funds are increasingly active in acquiring regional railroads, underscoring continued consolidation in the freight sector. FTAI Infrastructure recently announced a $1.05 billion agreement to acquire Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway, commonly cited as the largest independent regional railroad in the United States with approximately 840 miles of track. The transaction, expected to close subject to Surface Transportation Board approval, reflects the importance of scale, diversification, and network synergies in freight rail M&A. Similar transactions in 2025, including acquisitions of Minnesota Commercial Railway and Sabine River & Northern, signal sustained investor appetite for long-term transportation infrastructure assets with strong ties to energy, steel, and manufacturing supply chains.

Changing Tariff Landscape for Aviation Industry

Commercial aircraft and aircraft parts and engines imported into and exported from the U.S. had generally enjoyed zero tariff treatment under the 1980 WTO Agreement on Trade in Civil Aviation. That all changed on April 2, 2025, when President Trump announced new tariffs on a wide range of goods, including a 15% tariff on commercial aircraft and aircraft parts and engines imported from the EU. These tariffs not only impacted the purchase and sale of new aircraft equipment, but also in some cases included tariffs on the cost of aircraft engines and components being overhauled in foreign shops. On July 27, 2025, the U.S. and the EU announced they reached a framework agreement that would, among other things, exempt all commercial aircraft and aircraft parts and engines from tariffs. It is expected that the new U.S. / EU trade deal will be finalized and implemented soon.",https://www.ballardspahr.com/-/jssmedia/main/socialmedia/linkedin-graphic_general_colorful.jpg?rev=4869c25457e748268b6790844ec1d468&hash=061D5EC08A6A313F07A4FD932B0736B2,N,,2025-09-09 18:04:37.725614

RICHARDSON, Texas, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: FOSL) (the “ Company ”) announced today that it has commenced an exchange offer (the “ Exchange Offer ”) and, accordingly, is offering to exchange any and all of the Company’s outstanding 7.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “ Old Notes ”) for (i) in the case of a holder of Old Notes (a “ Holder ”) that validly participates in the New Money Financing (as defined herein) (a “ New Money Participant ”), (A) 9.500% First-Out First Lien Secured Senior Notes due 2029 (“ First-Out Notes ”) in an amount equal to 100% of the face amount of such First-Out Notes per equal face amount of Old Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and (B) such Holder’s pro rata portion of warrants (the “ Initial Public Warrants ”) exercisable into either shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“ Common Stock ”) or pre-funded warrants exercisable into shares of Common Stock; and (ii) in the case of a Holder that does not purchase First-Out Notes in the New Money Financing (a “ Non-New Money Participant ”), (A) 7.500% Second-Out Second Lien Secured Senior Notes due 2029 (“ Second-Out Notes ,” and together with the First-Out Notes, “ New Notes ”) in an amount equal to 100% of the face amount of such Second-Out Notes per equal face amount of Old Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn), and (B) such Holder’s pro rata portion of Initial Public Warrants. To validly participate in the Exchange Offer, a Holder must tender all their Old Notes.

Consent Solicitation

Concurrently with the Exchange Offer, the Company is soliciting each Holder to consent (the “ Consent Solicitation ”) to certain proposed amendments to the base indenture governing the Old Notes, dated November 8, 2021, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture thereto, dated November 8, 2021, and as may be further amended prior to the consummation of the Consent Solicitation (together, the “ Old Notes Indenture ”): (i)(A) to remove or modify certain covenants and events of default under the Old Notes Indenture that can be removed with the consent of Holders representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Old Notes and (B) to subordinate the Old Notes in right of payment to the New Notes on the terms to be set forth in the applicable supplemental indenture to the fullest extent permitted by Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the Old Notes Indenture (this clause (i), the “ Exchange Offer Amendments ”) or (ii) (A) to change the governing law of the Old Notes and Old Notes Indenture to the laws of England and Wales and (B) to remove a covenant under the Old Notes Indenture that can be removed with the consent of Holders representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Old Notes (this clause (ii), the “ UK Proceeding Amendments ” and together with the Exchange Offer Amendments, the “ Proposed Amendments ”).

By tendering Old Notes for exchange in the Exchange Offer, a Holder will be deemed to have validly (i) delivered their consent in the Consent Solicitation to the Proposed Amendments to the Old Notes Indenture and (ii) appointed the Information, Exchange and Subscription Agent as their proxy to implement a restructuring of the Company’s Old Notes on substantially the same terms as the Exchange Offer (with the exception of the Exchange Offer Amendments) through a proceeding under the UK Companies Act 2006 of England and Wales (a “ UK Proceeding ”), as further described in the Registration Statements (as defined herein). Subject to certain conditions as described in the Registration Statements, in the event that the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in the Registration Statements), or any other condition to completing the Exchange Offer without a UK Proceeding, is not satisfied or waived by the Exchange Offer Expiration Time (as defined herein), the Company will be required to proceed with the UK Proceeding pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement (as defined herein).

Holders who tender their Old Notes in the Exchange Offer and Supporting Holders who deliver their Old Notes in the Supporting Holders Exchange (as defined herein) and, therefore, are deemed to have provided their consents in the Consent Solicitation to the Proposed Amendments on or prior to the Exchange Offer Expiration Time will receive their pro rata portion of a consent premium consisting of an amount of New Notes aggregating $1.0 million in face amount (the “ Consent Premium ”).

Rights Offering

Concurrently with the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, the Company is launching a rights offering (the “ Rights Offering ”) to Holders of Old Notes, as to which the Supporting Holders have separately agreed in the Transaction Support Agreement to participate on a private placement basis. Such Holders will receive their pro rata portion of rights to subscribe (“ Subscription Rights ”) to purchase First-Out Notes in the New Money Financing at a purchase price equal to 100% of the face amount of the First-Out Notes so purchased and to receive on account of such purchase one share of Common Stock for each $34.06 of First-Out Notes so purchased. $12,941,327 of First-Out Notes offered in the New Money Financing will be offered in respect of Old Notes held by Holders (other than the Supporting Holders) pursuant to the Rights Offering, and the remaining $19,558,673 of First-Out Notes will be allocated to the Supporting Holders pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement (together, the “ New Money Financing ”). To participate in the Rights Offering, a Holder must subscribe for and purchase their Required Subscription Amount (as defined in the Registration Statements).

The table below provides in summary form a brief description of the principal aspects of the Exchange Offer, the Consent Solicitation and the Rights Offering (collectively, the “ Transactions ”), along with the consideration ultimately deliverable to Holders who successfully participate therein as well as the relevant participation deadline. The table is provided for your convenience, and does not describe the requirements for participation, conditions or other features of each such aspect of each Transaction.

In the event that the Minimum Tender Condition (or any other condition to completing the Exchange Offer without a UK Proceeding) is not satisfied or waived by such date and the Company is required, pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement, to proceed with the UK Proceeding, the Company will, subject to the terms of the Transaction Support Agreement, commence a UK Proceeding and seek to implement the restructuring of the Old Notes on substantially the same terms as the Exchange Offer (with the exception of the Exchange Offer Amendments) through a UK Proceeding. In such event, the Company will publicly announce its intention to commence a UK Proceeding and will extend the Exchange Offer and Rights Offering until the Conditional Expiration Time.

The Transactions are being effected pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) on September 9, 2025 (the “ S-3 Registration Statement ”) and a registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on September 9, 2025 (the “ S-4 Registration Statement ” and together with the S-3 Registration Statement, the “ Registration Statements ”) which have been filed with the SEC but have not yet become effective. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statements is subject to, and conditional upon, the satisfaction of or, where permitted, the waiver of, the conditions discussed in the Registration Statements including, among other things, the Minimum Tender Condition (in the event the restructuring of the Old Notes is not implemented through a UK Proceeding), the applicable conditions in the Transaction Support Agreement and the Registration Statements having been declared effective and remaining effective on the settlement date of the Transactions. The Company may, in compliance with the Transaction Support Agreement and with consent from the Supporting Holders, waive any such conditions at or prior to the applicable expiration time, except the condition that the Registration Statements have been declared effective by the SEC and remain effective on the applicable settlement date.

Certain existing Holders (the “ Supporting Holders ”) collectively hold approximately 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes as of the date of the launch of the Exchange Offer, the Consent Solicitation and the Rights Offering and, as previously announced, executed a Transaction Support Agreement with the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “ Transaction Support Agreement ”). The Supporting Holders have agreed to purchase First-Out Notes in an amount equal to their respective pro rata portion of the New Money Financing, and, in the event that not all Holders participate in the Rights Offering, to purchase additional First-Out Notes in a concurrent private transaction on substantially the same terms as Holders in the Rights Offering in an amount equal to the principal amount of the First-Out Notes unpurchased in the Rights Offering. The Supporting Holders have agreed to exchange all of their respective Old Notes for new First-Out Notes in a concurrent private transaction, to consent to the Proposed Amendments and to support a UK Proceeding, in each case, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Transaction Support Agreement (the “ Supporting Holders Exchange ”).

The world is rapidly changing, and Canada must be ready to lead in building the economy of the future. To meet this demand, it is more important than ever to equip Canadian workers with the skills they need to succeed in an energy sector that is rapidly evolving. At the same time, the Government of Canada is ensuring that researchers and innovators have the advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools and compute capacity needed to drive discovery and commercialization.

Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Jobs and Families and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario, and the Honourable Evan Solomon, Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, jointly highlighted federal investments to support workers and researchers in Canada’s energy sector. They were joined by the Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada.

Through the Sustainable Jobs Training Fund, the Government of Canada is investing over $9 million over three years in the AI Pathways: Energizing Canada’s Low-Carbon Workforce project. Led by the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), this initiative will help nearly 5,000 Canadian energy workers gain AI and machine learning skills for careers in wind, solar, geothermal and hydrogen energy. Training will offer both online and in-person formats, tailored to meet the diverse needs of mid-career workers, industry associations, and unions across the country.

In addition, Minister Solomon highlighted nearly $19.7 million in federal funding as part of the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy, to support Amii. This funding will expand access to advanced computing resources for Amii’s researchers and clients. Beginning in 2025–26, it will help accelerate AI research, development, and adoption by providing the compute capacity needed to train and deploy advanced AI models. It will also support Canadian businesses in bringing AI-enabled products and services to market, boosting productivity and competitiveness across the economy. In doing so, it will strengthen Canada’s innovation ecosystem, create new opportunities for students and entrepreneurs, and help ensure that the benefits of AI are shared widely and developed responsibly for all Canadians.

Together, these investments will strengthen Canada’s leadership in artificial intelligence and ensure that both workers and researchers have the resources to shape the future of energy. Today’s announcement is a step forward in building a more resilient and forward-looking economy – one that positions Canada to meet the moment and lead in the global clean energy transition.",https://www.canada.ca/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-09 18:03:42.541135

Eco Wave Power is also working on projects across the world, including in Taiwan, India and Portugal.","A new project turning waves from the ocean into renewable energy has launched at the Port of Los Angeles on Tuesday morning.

Eight blue steel floats that appear to be small boats were launched by Eco Wave Power at AltaSea's ocean institute in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, attached to an unused wharf.

The floats splash into the water, generating a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, with the larger goal of proving that ocean waves can be harnessed and turned into renewable energy.

""In 2011, I founded Eco Wave Power with one mission: to turn the natural and endless power of the waves into clean electricity,"" said Inna Braverman, the founder and CEO of Eco Wave Power (Nasdaq: WAVE).

The Department of Energy estimates that waves off the coasts of the U.S. generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America's energy needs. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity, being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.

As the small blue floats bob up and down, they push a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. The pressure in the tanks builds up, turning a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.

""This pilot is more than a project; it's a milestone. It shows that wave energy could be deployed right here along existing port infrastructure, without harming the ocean,"" Braverman said. ""It's also a project that supports local economy from design to construction; we worked with local subcontractors.""

Read bill text of the Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act here.","WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced legislation today to support President Trump’s American energy dominance agenda and shield Americans from artificially high gas prices by protecting Utah oil refineries from unfair fines by the federal government. The Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act would block the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from forcing refineries to shoulder forgiven fines from refineries that do not meet the EPA’s environmental standards. U.S. Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) cosponsored the legislation, which received endorsements from the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Energy Alliance.

“The Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act advances President Trump’s growth agenda for American energy and lowers costs for hardworking families, ensuring that refineries in Utah and across the nation are not subjected to unlawful regulations invented by DC lobbyists,” said Senator Mike Lee. “Nowhere in the Clean Air Act does it say that the swampy corn lobby can force Americans to pay more for their products. By jamming through more biofuels and environmental compliance costs, the corn lobby is stifling US energy producers and jacking up the price of fuel. It’s bad for refineries, bad for American families, and bad for American energy independence.”

“Our refineries play a critical role in supplying Wyoming families and businesses with affordable energy. Outrageous compliance costs under the Renewable Fuel Standard threaten to raise prices for families across the country,” said Senator John Barrasso. “Our legislation will prevent increased compliance costs and help keep gas prices down for the people of Wyoming.”

“The small refinery exemption was meant to provide relief, not shift costs onto larger refineries,” said Senator Cynthia Lummis. “I’m proud to join my western colleagues in introducing legislation that preserves fairness and common sense at the EPA by clarifying Congress’ intent. This will prevent unfair compliance costs, protect Wyoming jobs while keeping gas prices down for people throughout the Cowboy State, and uphold President Trump’s commitment to unleashing American energy.”

“As if a $70 billion RFS price tag and a mandate for record imports wasn’t enough, the U.S. EPA is threatening to further undercut the President’s energy dominance agenda by reallocating more than a billion gallons of exempted RFS volumes from small refiners to their competitors. This is akin to your neighbor getting a tax break and the IRS showing up at your doorstep with the bill. It is simply wrong and will not meaningfully change the volume of corn ethanol that gets blended into American gasoline. We’re grateful to Senator Lee for introducing this legislation that will make it explicitly clear that EPA cannot re-assign massive regulatory burdens from one refinery to others. This bill will save American consumers billions of dollars. It will benefit U.S. energy security and help to ensure that American fuel manufacturers use more of their resources on productive things — like jobs, facility construction projects, and energy infrastructure — instead of red tape from the EPA.” – Chet Thompson, CEO and President, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers

Background

The EPA requires refineries in the U.S. to includes a minimum volume of renewable fuel (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel, etc.) in all fuel sold, or pay to make up for any level of noncompliance. Small refineries may be granted exemptions if complying would cause “disproportionate economic hardship.”

The EPA is currently considering whether to reallocate forgiven payments over to non-exempt refineries, forcing compliant producers to shoulder even more costs despite no authorization from the Clean Air Act to do so.

This is an antiquated Bush-era program that originated in a time when there were fears about an “addiction to foreign oil” and a looming cliff for domestic oil production, seeking to turn the industry toward biofuels. Despite those fears proving unfounded, the program escalates its requirements each period, with the most recent Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) being the highest ever proposed.

By the EPA’s own calculation, the proposed rule would impose compliance costs of approximately $6.7 billion per year, while returning benefits of only $200 million per year. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) estimates that compliance costs are closer to $70 billion.

This is simply a handout for the biofuel and agriculture industries at the expense of American refineries and consumers, who will see prices at the pump increase if the EPA moves forward with its proposed rule and reallocation of exempted payments.

The Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act would protect Americans from artificially high gas prices by blocking the EPA from forcing refineries to shoulder unfair fines.

The cancellation of these projects comes as energy demand continues to grow and consumer electricity bills surge as a result of the Trump Administration’s attacks on clean energy across the country.

“We write to express serious concerns with the cancellation of 24 projects that were supported through statutorily mandated programs overseen by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), as well as the process by which these cancellations were carried out,” wrote the lawmakers. “We are concerned that the cancellation process undertaken by the Department was haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven, and we are disturbed that the Department intends to continue to use this same fatally flawed and politicized process to terminate more awards in the near future.”

Focusing on DOE’s announcement to cancel project awards, the lawmakers highlighted, “on May 30 and with cursory explanation, the Department announced the termination of 24 projects totaling $3.7 billion. The Department’s decision to terminate these projects runs afoul of the law.”

“These programs are not optional,” wrote the lawmakers. “These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress. You have no legal authority to sabotage them; indeed, you possess a constitutional obligation to ensure that they are ‘faithfully executed.’”

The letter outlined the problematic review process undertaken by the Department and highlighted Secretary Wright’s confirmation of the “involvement of the Department’s political appointees in the termination of these awards.”

The lawmakers noted, “This is highly unusual and counter to longstanding DOE precedent. It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards.”

The lawmakers noted DOE’s cancellation of the projects warranted further investigation, “In order to maintain the integrity of the Department’s merit-based review processes, political appointees have not historically participated in evaluating project applications. Such a capricious departure from independent, merit-based agency procedure warrants investigation.”

The letter concluded with the Ranking Members of the committees requesting answers to several questions outlining the process the Department used to cancel the loans that OCED designated and requesting related materials.

Read the full letter here(link is external) and below:

Dear Secretary Wright:

We write to express serious concerns with the cancellation of 24 projects that were supported through statutorily mandated programs overseen by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), as well as the process by which these cancellations were carried out. We are concerned that the cancellation process undertaken by DOE was haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven, and we are disturbed that the Department intends to continue to use this same fatally flawed and politicized process to terminate more awards in the near future. Troublingly, the Department cancelled projects that would re-shore domestic manufacturing, increase domestic critical material production, and spur industrial innovations. We demand that you cease the cancellation process and restore respect for independent, merit-based reviews.

On May 15, DOE announced that it was “reviewing” 179 projects that it claimed totaled $15 billion worth of investments. Later that month, on May 30 and with cursory explanation, the Department announced the termination of 24 projects totaling $3.7 billion. DOE’s decision to terminate these projects runs afoul of the law.

These programs are not optional. In fact, 18 of the cancelled projects were associated with the Industrial Decarbonization Program authorized by the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act (IIJA) in Section 41008, Industrial Emissions Demonstration Projects, and Section 50161, Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. One award was made pursuant to the IIJA Section 40342, the Clean Energy on Former and Current Mine Lands (CEML) program, and five awards were made pursuant to IIJA Section 41004, Carbon Capture Demonstration and Pilots (authorized in the Energy Act of 2020 and funded under IIJA). These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress. You have no legal authority to sabotage them; indeed, you possess a constitutional obligation to ensure that they are “faithfully executed.”

In order to better understand DOE’s justification for terminating these projects, committee staff from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce received a video briefing from the Department on June 17. The information provided by the Department to our staff was deeply concerning. On this call, DOE detailed the process – or lack thereof – by which these 24 projects were terminated. DOE acknowledged that its review process was run by political appointees from start to finish, that the review decisions considered a project’s “alignment” with the administration’s political priorities, and even that the review decisions themselves were explicitly “subjective” rather than governed by an objective evaluation process. Perhaps not surprisingly as a result, committee staff have received reports from awardees that the termination notices sent by DOE were littered with factual inaccuracies.

During the briefing, DOE lawyers disclosed the following information to committee staff:

The decisions to terminate the awards were made entirely by a group of eight or nine political appointees serving on an ad hoc “review committee” set up solely to evaluate project cancellations.

The process to cancel these awards took only two weeks, from start to finish.

The review committee considered each award and made its decisions based on nothing more than a one-page summary memo for each project, which was drafted by yet another political appointee.

The review committee employed a set of eight vague and opaque criteria to determine which awards would be terminated, including such criteria as “market analysis,” “technology,” and “national security.”

The review committee made its cancellation decisions based upon an explicitly “subjective” analysis of the eight criteria, without any requirement for a numerical score or evaluation to inform its final decisions. The review committee did not even establish an official number of criteria that a project would need to “pass” or “fail” before undertaking its review. Termination decisions could be made based upon any combination of criteria, and there was no independent expert review process to support these highly consequential determinations.

The merit-based process by which these projects were awarded was disregarded.

More cancellations are set to take place using this same process. The Department is currently evaluating projects from the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office, the Grid Deployment Office, and additional projects in OCED.

On June 18, you appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and confirmed the involvement of DOE’s political appointees in the termination of these awards. This is highly unusual and counter to longstanding DOE precedent. It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards. Expert career officials within DOE assembled and utilized independent expert panels to carry out initial application evaluations. Final award recommendations were only made to a career Senior Executive Service employee within OCED. Political appointees within DOE were not even informed of who applied for these awards until the final selections were made, and they were only informed of these selections two days before the Department provided notification of these awards to relevant Congressional Committees.

In order to maintain the integrity of the Department’s merit-based review processes, political appointees have not historically participated in evaluating project applications. Such a capricious departure from independent, merit-based agency procedure warrants investigation.

During the June briefing, committee staff requested that the Department produce information to help Congress better understand the nature of these terminations. Despite multiple information requests by the committees, the Department has yet to produce any of the requested materials. We therefore request the Department provide responses to the following questions and produce the requested materials by September 23, 2025:

Please describe in detail the Department’s contract review process prior to terminating the 24 contracts. In your response, please specify the factors considered.

In its May 30, 2025, termination announcement, the Department stated, “[a]fter a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” For each contract terminated, please describe in detail why the Department reached the conclusion the “project failed to advance the energy needs of the American people” and “were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

In its May 15, 2025, announcement, the Department stated, “the DOE has begun requesting additional information needed to evaluate 179 awards.” Does the Department intend to cancel more awarded projects that previously went through a rigorous, merit-based approval processes? If so, does the Department still intend to use the same cancellation process run by political appointees used to cancel OCED projects on May 30?

In addition, please provide the following:

Department officials told the committees that DOE created “one pagers” or “one-page summary memos” for each OCED project considered for cancellation. Please provide copies of these “one pagers” or “one-page summary memos.”

Please provide the assessments completed for each terminated project to determine that they did not sufficiently meet the “eight criteria” referenced in the June briefing.

Please provide the charter for the OCED project review committee, including the date established and a comprehensive list of participants.

We look forward to your prompt response.

Today’s hearing continues Republicans’ illogical plan to increase monthly energy bills for American families, who are already struggling to make ends meet as prices on everyday goods increase thanks to Trump’s trade war. The latest jobs report – the worst since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic – proves just how devastating Republican policies are. In August, job growth came to a crawl, adding just 22,000 jobs.

At a time when home energy bills are rising all over the country, in large part thanks to the disastrous and malicious policies of the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans, House Republicans have chosen to double down on their attacks on the very tools we have to keep energy bills low.

In my home state of New Jersey, energy prices have already increased thanks to PJM’s inability to add new resources to the grid. These increases, coupled with the devastating project financing cuts from the Trump Administration, hurt New Jersey families. And now, House Republicans seem to have decided that rather than helping everyday families with monthly energy bills, they want to make our homes more expensive to heat and cool.

Today, we are likely to hear Republicans misrepresent the facts around energy efficiency, conservation standards, and building codes. Let me set the record straight about some of this misinformation.

Committee Republicans continue to circulate a factually inaccurate claim about the costs of meeting the 2021 international energy code. Their bogus number is the result of double counting and including measures not required by the code. In reality, building energy codes have a negligible impact on housing prices, but they save homeowners real money on their monthly energy bill from the moment they move into the home.

Republicans will also suggest that energy efficiency standards disproportionately target natural gas products, but in reality, the law prohibits DOE from eliminating products based on their fuel source.

This is all incredibly important in a time of rising energy prices, increased energy demand on the grid, and slowed job growth. Republicans’ Big Ugly Bill is projected to raise electricity prices by an astonishing 61 percent over the next decade, costing Americans nearly $300 more each year. Trump ran on a promise to cut energy costs in half in his first year, but Republicans jammed through this disastrous bill that provides giant tax breaks for their billionaire friends, while sending Americans’ utility bills through the roof.

Energy efficiency standards are popular. In 2024, American households saved over $500 on their energy bills thanks to industry-supported appliance standards. And in 2023, energy efficiency jobs employed almost 2.3 million people.

But I’m not surprised that we’re here debating all of this again. Energy efficiency used to be a bipartisan topic, but over the last few years, Republicans have politicized and polarized these commonsense policies.

Congressional Republicans and the Trump Administration spent the first eight months of the year gutting the Department of Energy, targeting efficiency standards through numerous Congressional Review Act resolutions, gutting clean energy incentives, keeping expensive fossil fuel plants online, and imposing costly tariffs that are supercharging inflation. These actions directly result in rising costs for Americans. Republicans don’t care about lowering costs, all they care about is rewarding their oil and gas friends, punishing clean energy, and keeping President Trump happy.

It doesn’t matter what the facts are. If Trump doesn’t like his shower head, Congressional Republicans will prioritize his needs over the needs of everyday Americans.

Thank you to the witnesses for being here today. I hope we’re able to have a productive conversation centered around facts and the merits of energy efficiency. I yield back the balance of my time.

LITIGATION AND DISPUTES

Pennsylvania Appeals Court Affirms Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Regulations

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC) recently promulgated regulations that assign grid improvement and connection costs to customers with systems that generate excess energy for sale to distribution companies. Certain of these customers contended that the regulations violated Pennsylvania’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act by imposing interconnection costs on customers rather than electricity distribution companies and ratepayers. These petitioners instead asserted that the costs were indirect costs that should have been recovered from ratepayers. The petitioners protesting the promulgated rules contended that the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act requires interconnection costs to instead be paid by ratepayers as a cost of generation supply. The state appellate court disagreed, ruling on August 13 that the Act did not prohibit the PAPUC from assigning grid improvements and connection costs to customers generating excess energy for sale to distribution companies. The court also noted that accepting the petitioner’s interpretation could lead to an absurd result, stating that “although petitioners currently limit their argument to interconnection costs as being an indirect cost of alternative energy, the logical extension of their position is that all costs associated with project development – construction, financing, and operation of a customer-generator system – would similarly qualify as indirect costs.”

California High Court Asserts Judicial Oversight Over Public Utilities Commission

California’s Supreme Court recently curtailed the deference that the state judiciary owes to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in an August 8 decision. The underlying dispute involved the compensation that California utilities pay for excess power generated by rooftop solar operations. In 2022, the CPUC adopted a tariff greatly reducing the price utilities pay for this excess power. Various environmental groups sued. The district court deferred to the CPUC’s determination under a 1968 California Supreme Court decision—Greyhound Lines Inc. v. Public Utilities Commission—which stated that CPUC interpretations of the public utilities code “should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language.” The Supreme Court, however, examined numerous legislative developments expanding judicial review, and concluded that the significant deference afforded by the Greyhound-court was no longer appropriate. The court instead directed future tribunals to apply the standard articulated in the 1998 Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization, which affords agencies significantly less deference.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

Treasury Adjusts Rules for Wind and Solar Tax Credits

On August 15, the U.S. Treasury Department released updated guidance governing the eligibility of wind- and solar-energy projects for 45Y and 48E tax credits. 45Y and 45E Tax Credits are technology-neutral tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act and require the commencement of construction as a precondition to eligibility. Under previous guidance, developers needed to establish expenditure of at least 5% of the project budget to be eligible for the credits. The new guidance replaced the simple 5% expenditure threshold with a more qualitative requirement that “physical work of a significant nature” has begun to establish the commencement of construction. Only solar projects with less than 1.5 MW of output may still establish the commencement of construction through the expenditure of 5% of total cost.

Trump Administration Considers Axing Solar Funds

The Inflation Reduction Act established a $7 billion Solar for All fund, which confers funding on recipients to facilitate solar adoption by low-income communities. The Trump administration froze the funds in February 2025. The Trump administration unfroze the funds in response to court orders. But the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced in a video in August that it was terminating the program, arguing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act authorizes the termination. Numerous advocacy organizations are threatening lawsuits over the refreeze.

Duke Energy Seeks Merger

On August 14, Duke Energy filed requests with state and federal regulators seeking approval to combine two constituent utilities serving the Carolinas: Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The resulting entity would supply electricity to nearly five million customers, and Duke asserts that the merger would precipitate customer savings exceeding $1 billion. The company also contends that the merger will improve reliability and efficiency within the companies’ 52,000-square-mile service area. Duke has operated the two subsidiaries independently since 2012 and, despite consolidation of corporate functions, the operation and planning of power grids continue to remain separate. Duke states that this continued bifurcation limits the cost- and energy-saving potential of the entities. The merger requires approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

FERC Allows Reactivation of Iowa Nuclear Plant to Proceed

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a waiver request on August 25 that will allow the reopening of the Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Palo, Iowa. Economic forces caused the closure of the plant in 2020, and the owner subsequently planned to use the plant’s interconnection for solar energy. Changing economic conditions, however, have caused the owner—NextEra Energy—to pursue reopening of the nuclear facility. Accordingly, NextEra sought (and received) a waiver to use Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s generator replacement process to consolidate the solar interconnection agreements with an additional interconnection agreement for the nuclear power plant. The next step in reopening the nuclear facility requires restoration of the plant’s operating license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

FERC Approves Cost Allocation Paths for Post-Shutdown Power Plants

FERC recently approved pathways to recover costs of compliance with a U.S. Department of Energy order mandating the continued operations of power plants that were slated for retirement. The Department of Energy ordered the continued operation of the plants in an emergency order, stating that energy shortages grid reliability required that the plants remain in operation. Consequently, the 1,560-MW J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan has incurred substantial costs after being ordered by the Department to continue operations after its projected retirement date. Pursuant to FERC’s order, those costs will now be shared across MISO’s northern and central regions. FERC declined calls to limit the cost allocation to Michigan or to mandate participation of MISO’s southern region.

New York Regulators Slash Utility Rate Requests

In two mid-August decisions, the New York Public Service Commission (NY PSC) adopted joint proposals that cut two utilities’ requested rate increases substantially. In the first case, National Grid had requested a base delivery increase of $509.6 million (25.5 percent delivery or 10.4 percent total revenue) and $156.5 million (29.7 percent delivery or 15.7 percent total revenue) for electric and gas, respectively for one year. The NY PSC instead adopted a levelized approach, authorizing more modest increases of $167.3 million in the first year, $297.4 million in the second year, and $243.4 million in the third year. In approving the modified, levelized approach, NY PSC staff scrutinized the proposed rate increase and limited recoverable expenses to those necessary to provide safe and reliable service. The NY PSC also approved a joint proposal in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation rate case, reducing the company’s request for total electric delivery revenues by over $17.5 million and total gas delivery revenues by nearly $800,000 in the first year.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15401_555.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 18:03:25.200997

With this action, the Trump EPA is addressing America’s energy needs and promoting the development of data centers critical to making the U.S. the Artificial Intelligence (AI) capital of the world, all while taking necessary steps to protect human health and safeguard our environment.

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “We are continuing to fix this broken system. Today’s guidance is another step to allow the build out of essential power generation, data centers, and manufacturing projects that will bring about America’s Golden Age.”

EPA intends to initiate a rulemaking to revise the definition of “Begin Actual Construction” in EPA’s NSR regulations and codify how permitting authorities may distinguish between emissions units and other parts of a stationary source facility that are not an emissions unit or part of an emissions unit.

By doing so it will be easy to understand what parts of construction need an NSR permit and what construction activities can proceed without an NSR permit. This will also allow cut down on construction deadlines.

Most of the penalty — more than $877,000 — sanctions Stella-Jones over money the company saved by cutting corners on its environmental compliance.
DEQ said Stella-Jones saved $577,000 alone by failing to clean out its stormwater treatment system, which could have prevented or mitigated some pollution.
Instead, they are ordering the company to test the water more frequently and make upgrades to its stormwater treatment system.
It previously took that option in 2018 to resolve an earlier DEQ penalty for pentachlorophenol pollution, reducing invasive blackberry and ivy along a creek in a nearby town.","The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has fined a polluting wood treater in northwest Oregon more than $1 million for a slew of violations stretching back to 2022.

The seven-figure penalty comes just 11 days after InvestigateWest revealed that state regulators had been taking years to stop Canadian company Stella-Jones from sending stormwater tainted with toxic wood preservatives into the South Yamhill River, a drinking water source for nearly 6,000 residents in the town of Sheridan. Regulators’ lack of enforcement and public disclosure kept the pollution hidden from residents, despite inquiries about potential human and environmental health effects from the site.

DEQ cited Stella-Jones for 23 violations including releasing polluted stormwater into the river, illegally disposing of hazardous wastes and failing to report and immediately clean up chemical spills. Most of the penalty — more than $877,000 — sanctions Stella-Jones over money the company saved by cutting corners on its environmental compliance. DEQ said Stella-Jones saved $577,000 alone by failing to clean out its stormwater treatment system, which could have prevented or mitigated some pollution.

The most expensive violations were for illegally sending thousands of tons of hazardous waste to landfills not permitted to accept it and for releasing polluted stormwater into the South Yamhill River, according to DEQ’s enforcement letter.

DEQ found the releases into the river “had a significant adverse impact on human health or the environment.”

State officials said they have no plans to take the most drastic step available against the company: shutting down Stella-Jones’ operations in Sheridan by revoking the permit that allows it to release water into the river. Instead, they are ordering the company to test the water more frequently and make upgrades to its stormwater treatment system.

“If we revoked the permit, DEQ would lose a tool to regulate the facility — and because it is a Superfund site, it would still be generating contamination and stormwater that needs treatment,” said Dylan Darling, an agency spokesperson.

Erin Saylor, interim manager of DEQ’s enforcement office, said in a news release Monday that the agency “hopes the magnitude of this enforcement will … result in long-term compliance at the facility.”

“This enforcement not only addresses the company’s past violations, but also requires the company to revise its operations plan, conduct additional monitoring, and take other preventative measures,” Saylor said.

Stella-Jones did not immediately respond to questions about the penalty or whether it plans to appeal.

DEQ has been investigating Stella-Jones for repeated violations of its stormwater permit for more than three years while continuing to allow the company to dump stormwater tainted with pentachlorophenol, a likely carcinogenic preservative, into the South Yamhill River. During that time, the agency also helped police and prosecutors investigate the company, culminating in Stella-Jones pleading guilty to 10 counts of unlawful water pollution in court last month. To resolve that case the company agreed to pay a $250,000 fine.

DEQ took years to finish up its own review because the case was so complex and the enforcement office is understaffed, said Darling, the spokesperson.

The agency did little to inform residents about what was going on while it repeatedly warned Stella-Jones that it was facing imminent penalties, InvestigateWest’s reporting showed.

A DEQ spokesperson said the agency has kept “all those who need to know” informed of the situation including city officials, residents who live next to the site and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, whose reservation lies a few miles upstream of the site and whose ceded lands include the city of Sheridan.

However, some Sheridan residents who inquired about the health of the river received only vague responses from the agency. In the summer of 2023, Mike Hailey, a former resident, asked the agency why his crayfish traps were empty downriver from Stella-Jones, the first time he had encountered that in decades. He was told only that the Environmental Protection Agency was doing testing in the area and more information would be available after that.

The EPA has been involved with Sheridan’s wood treatment site for decades. In 2001, when the site was owned by a different company, the EPA designated it a Superfund, which aims to clean up chemicals that pose a risk to human health. It spent the next decade and millions of dollars cleaning up pentachlorophenol-contaminated soil and groundwater. While continuing to monitor the site, the EPA discovered that its own measures to contain tainted groundwater were likely failing in 2022, and began investigating the extent of the pollution onsite to determine if new cleanup was warranted. That cleanup is still likely years from being completed, but the EPA has determined that Stella-Jones is responsible for at least some of the contamination on the property, due to its repeated spills.

Both the EPA and DEQ had banned the use of pentachlorophenol on the property during the Superfund cleanup, but both reversed course in 2011, after the company onsite said the plant would close if it wasn’t allowed to start using pentachlorophenol again. DEQ continues to oversee the site by way of air and water quality permits and enforcement of rules around hazardous waste.

The EPA has since imposed a phased ban on pentachlorophenol and will completely bar its use by February 2027, after concluding there are other, less harmful alternatives wood treaters can use.

Aside from DEQ’s civil penalty issued Monday, state and federal regulators have previously leveled smaller penalties against Stella-Jones for releasing contaminated stormwater and chemical spills.

In July, the EPA reached a settlement agreement with Stella-Jones for $98,000 for its failure to maintain an adequate spill prevention plan and train workers under the federal Clean Water Act.

Stella-Jones could cover up to 80% of the $1 million penalty by funding an environmental project aimed at benefiting human health or the environment, subject to approval by DEQ. It previously took that option in 2018 to resolve an earlier DEQ penalty for pentachlorophenol pollution, reducing invasive blackberry and ivy along a creek in a nearby town.

It could face additional penalties if it fails to comply with any of DEQ’s orders aimed at stopping continued pollution on the site.

This is his second term as governor and he's declared a goal of making Georgia the “ electric mobility capital of America.
Kemp has journeyed twice to South Korea to meet with Hyundai and other big investors in Georgia, including electric battery maker LG Group.","ATLANTA (AP) — Can Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp be tough on immigration and still encourage foreign investment?

Kemp has courted foreign investment to his state but also once offered to use his own pickup truck to round up “criminal illegals.” Those two stances collided this past week when immigration authorities raided a battery plant and detained foreign workers, putting Kemp in a tough spot.

Some 475 people were held in the raid, including more than 300 South Koreans, at the construction site for a battery plant that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution slated to open next year. The battery plant is part of a $7.6 billion complex planned to eventually employ 8,500 people. It was announced and then expanded after trips by Kemp to South Korea to court officials at Hyundai and other firms.

The detentions sparked questions in South Korea about its relationship with the United States, especially when Hyundai and its partners. Hyundai has said it’s investing $26 billion in the United States from 2025 to 2028. That includes not only the plant in Ellabell, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group makes electric vehicles, but a separate $5 billion battery joint venture in Cartersville, Georgia, a steel mill in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, a robotics hub and expansion of the Hyundai plant in Montgomery, Alabama and the Kia Corp. plant in West Point, Georgia.

Kemp has voiced support for immigration enforcement but been restrained in the raid's aftermath.

“In Georgia, we will always enforce the law, including all state and federal immigration laws. All companies operating within the state must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation,” the governor's office said Friday in a written statement.

Kemp can’t run again for governor in 2026 and passed up a U.S. Senate race, but has entertained talk of a 2028 run for president. He hasn’t yet said anything about whether the raid will have a long-term impact on Hyundai’s investments. On Friday, his office said only that the state Department of Public Safety had coordinated with ICE to support the raid.

Kemp’s office didn’t immediately respond to further questions Tuesday.

This is his second term as governor and he's declared a goal of making Georgia the “ electric mobility capital of America. ” But the Republican has also talked tough on illegal immigration, saying in a 2018 ad that “I’ve got a big truck, just in case I’ve got to round up some criminal illegals and take them home myself,” and backing a state law that requires local jails to check the immigration status of prisoners.

The raid comes as Kemp has been aligning more closely with President Donald Trump’s administration on immigration enforcement and other issues. The governor has a long history of asserting his independence from Trump, which has at times led to headline-grabbing conflict. But Kemp last month announced he would mobilize 75 National Guard soldiers to provide support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Georgia. He followed that by announcing he would send more than 300 National Guard members to take part in Trump’s law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.

Like most governors, Kemp seeks foreign investment, which has built up most of the auto industry in the South. Kemp has journeyed twice to South Korea to meet with Hyundai and other big investors in Georgia, including electric battery maker LG Group.

Kemp disputes claims that tax dollars were subsidizing the jobs of those detained. His administration says none of the $2.1 billion in projected state and local incentives for the Hyundai complex directly benefits subcontractors who employ detainees.

“Without exception, the Department of Economic Development expects anyone doing business in Georgia to follow federal and state laws,” the department said.

Kemp has welcomed green energy investment and jobs, but has clashed with Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff over who should get credit for Georgia’s green energy boom.

Kemp sharply disputes that incentives signed by President Joe Biden spurred investment, saying industries were already coming to Georgia before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022. But if anything, the rush accelerated after Biden signed his climate law.

The 33 additional projects announced by the end of 2024 were the most nationwide, according to E2, an environmental business group. Exact figures differ, but projects in Georgia top $20 billion, pledging more than 25,000 jobs. Hyundai has continued investing even as Trump and congressional Republicans rolled back electric vehicle incentives.",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/political/2025/09/09/22152484/68c084fd8d758-media_1095891bb2394eb698721e02fde01f12-DMID1-689lo5fpv-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:05:25.285835

In 2018, Clean Wisconsin sued the EPA to force the agency to declare the three southeastern Wisconsin counties aren’t complying with federal air quality rules.
Ozone pollution, also known as smog, occurs most often in the summer when air pollution from vehicle exhaust and industrial processes reacts with sunlight.
DNR analysis has found that less than 10% of the ozone pollution in the state is caused by Wisconsin industry.
“It’s unfair to punish Wisconsin businesses for pollution they didn’t create, and [the] order is the first step toward righting this wrong.”","A federal appeals court has ruled that the state of Wisconsin and businesses operating in certain parts of southeastern Wisconsin will not be required to meet more stringent air quality standards for ozone pollution — giving state regulators and industry a reprieve from what they say were “costly and burdensome requirements.”

On Friday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the state’s request to temporarily postpone a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Late last year, the EPA reclassified areas of Milwaukee, Kenosha and Sheboygan counties as being in “serious nonattainment” of the agency’s 2015 ozone standards. In February, the state filed a lawsuit for the review of the EPA finding.

The enforcement of the EPA standard would have forced the state to revise its plan for complying with national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, and hundreds of businesses would have had to assess if their existing permits need to be renewed or revised. The state complained that these measures would have cost the Department of Natural Resources and the state’s businesses millions of dollars when most of the ozone pollution over the areas is caused elsewhere and settles over southeast Wisconsin after drifting across Lake Michigan.

Environmental groups have said that even if Wisconsin’s industries aren’t creating most of the ozone pollution, the businesses have a duty to work to protect the health and well-being of the state’s residents. In 2018, Clean Wisconsin sued the EPA to force the agency to declare the three southeastern Wisconsin counties aren’t complying with federal air quality rules.

Ozone pollution, also known as smog, occurs most often in the summer when air pollution from vehicle exhaust and industrial processes reacts with sunlight. The pollution can be harmful to people’s respiratory systems.

“The fact that southeastern Wisconsin has been reclassified as in serious nonattainment for ozone means that residents of those counties are at higher risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and Wisconsin should be implementing all possible policies and strategies to reduce ozone pollution to protect public health,” Clean Wisconsin attorney Katie Nekola said in a statement to Wisconsin Public Radio.

But business groups and the state have argued the costs are too high for a problem that doesn’t start in Wisconsin. DNR analysis has found that less than 10% of the ozone pollution in the state is caused by Wisconsin industry.

The state Department of Justice said in its lawsuit that the “change triggers costly permit requirements, complex regulations, and stringent emissions offset mandates,” which could create $4 million in added costs for the state and cost an estimated 382 businesses between $1 million and $6.9 million.

Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, said the court’s Friday order grants relief from the “crushing and job-killing ozone regulations.”

“Data from both the DNR and EPA indicate that the vast majority of ozone pollution in eastern Wisconsin is caused by emissions originating from outside our state borders,” Manley said in a statement. “It’s unfair to punish Wisconsin businesses for pollution they didn’t create, and [the] order is the first step toward righting this wrong.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/refinery.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 17:04:08.538606

These green lines — made using photoluminescent paint that absorbs light in the day and emits it at night — are joined by temperature-sensitive markings in the form of ice crystals that only appear in freezing conditions, as well as lanes capable of charging electric cars and road sensors that tell drivers’ navigation apps whether upcoming traffic lights are green or red.

The Dutch Smart Highway is one of a growing number of road projects worldwide that are revolutionizing how we travel. In Gumi City, South Korea, a 24km stretch of highway nicknamed the “electric avenue” can wirelessly charge passing electric buses. Detroit, Michigan, won a contract for the U.S.’s first such stretch of road, which doubles as a wireless EV-charging system. Colorado’s sensor networks provide drivers real-time traffic and weather data, making journeys safer through the Rocky Mountains.

Smart highways are roadways that implement technology to create a safer, smoother, and more sustainable driving experience. Real-time monitoring is guided by artificial intelligence and connected via the Internet of Things. Smart highways are an intelligent ecosystem that can “think,” communicate, and actively manage transportation.

The History of Smart Highways

The vision was first set in 1939 at the World’s Fair in New York, where a General Motors exhibit imagined cars using radio signals embedded in the roads to travel at optimal speeds. The concept gained momentum in the 1990s, when the US Congress passed a bill that provided funding to develop technology for driverless cars and automated highways.

Traffic sensors, control centers, and variable message signs were adopted in more and more places in the 2000s, and in 2006, one of the world’s first true smart highways was introduced on the M42 near Birmingham in the UK. Here, variable speed limits and using the hard shoulder as an extra lane during heavy traffic led to reduced journey times and significantly fewer accidents.

Since then, computing power has improved, and the tech has gotten cheaper; the revolutionary roadways in Gumi and Oss both opened in 2013.

Building a Smart Highway

Construction requires numerous materials and technologies. Road surfaces must be durable enough to accommodate embedded electronics (such as lane-lighting LEDs, communication nodes, or inductive EV coils or charging panels). Traditional concrete or asphalt is still used, but sometimes recycled plastic is included as a binder to increase strength, or specialized asphalt and concrete blends are used for added grip and resistance.

Technology poles installed at intervals along the highway house sensors, computing systems, and other technology. CCTV cameras monitor the number and speed of vehicles, as well as the weather and road surface conditions. Sustainable energy features, such as wind turbines on lamp posts or solar panels in noise barriers, can also be incorporated into smart highway designs.

Establishing 5G or other high-speed communication networks is crucial for real-time data exchange. Data collected by smart highways is processed by AI to enable real-time hazard detection and traffic optimization and to facilitate predictive maintenance. Digital signs and adaptive traffic lights then relay the decisions made by AI algorithms to drivers — a new speed limit, perhaps, or a lane closure or warning message.

Some construction plans involve modular prefabricated kits, so the complicated work of embedding sensors into roadways can be done ahead of time instead of on the jobsite.

Benefits and Challenges

Smart highways prevent crashes and minimize their impact when they happen – through immediate alerts to drivers, autonomous vehicles, or the emergency services, as well as by adjusting speed limits or rerouting traffic. Sensors can detect potholes, icy patches, and deer and learn the difference between a car tire and a paper bag, all quicker than a human can.

Active traffic management systems reduce congestion for commuters, while smoother journeys mean drivers use less fuel. Some smart highways have other eco-friendly additions, like solar panels powering signs or sensors. Optimizing existing road capacity means less need for new roads – preserving green spaces – while the smart highways movement bolsters support for automation and electric vehicles.

The technology, which provides real-time updates, can also monitor the state of our roads, flagging and proactively addressing potholes or straining bridges before they become a problem. Traffic data can also help maintenance crews to plan roadworks in the least disruptive way.

There are, however, risks. Not least of these is data collection and privacy concerns: the same data that will help contractors and planners may be eyed up by commercial companies (like McDonald’s and Starbucks) or law enforcement. Smart highways depend on connectivity, which also makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Public buy-in will depend on reassurance that data is securely stored, protected, encrypted, anonymized, and subject to strict GDPR privacy rules — not a tool for surveillance or exploitation. Legislation and regulation will need to keep pace with technological advances, while transport agencies will need elite-level IT security skills.

Smart highways don’t come cheap. As well as the hardware (sensors, cameras, and so on), there are data processing centers, cloud services, and the manpower to maintain them all. Determining how to split the bill – between government investment, private partners, taxpayers, and toll road users – is often controversial. Another potential headache is ensuring that technology systems developed by different car manufacturers and urban planners are compatible.

The Future of Smart Highways

The evolution of the highway depends on a future where most new cars on the market have built-in V2X communication units—devices that allow cars to communicate with their surroundings. This nods to a predominantly autonomous future: We will increasingly see cars and trucks driving themselves down dedicated lanes on smart highways, with road infrastructure designed primarily for autonomous traffic.

This is already happening in China, while freight corridors to support autonomous trucking are opening up in Michigan, Texas, and Georgia.

Smart highways will depend on constantly evolving technology. This includes road networks enabled by 6G and enhanced by AI and virtual simulations, as well as concrete road panels with embedded sensors and wireless connectivity that essentially turn the highway into a giant computer. More highways will likely follow South Korea’s lead in embedding charging pads or conductive rails into the road surface for charging electric vehicles as they drive. And some surfaces might even contain self-healing materials (special polymers or bacteria mixtures), which can automatically seal cracks in the road.

This future could also see highways becoming energy self-sufficient, or even energy positive. While an experiment to lay solar panel roadways failed in Normandy, France (too expensive; unable to withstand the weight of tractors), other innovations are in the offing – such as small wind turbines which catch the gusts from passing vehicles, or even piezoelectric crystals, which could generate electricity from the pressure of cars driving over them.

Ultimately, smart highways will work as part of a more holistic smart city system. In heavy congestion, for instance, they will be able to communicate with city traffic lights, public transit systems, or even ride-sharing services or logistics companies.

Although complications remain, as AI, V2X communication, and materials science advance, we will continue to witness a paradigm shift in how our roads function.

A facility expansion will add manufacturing capabilities to supply components to First Solar’s new factory in Iberia Parish.

Construction is expected to start this fall and wrap up by the end of 2026.

GRAND COTEAU, La. – Noble Plastics, a woman-owned small business specializing in custom plastic injection molding, announced it is investing $8.5 million to expand the company’s St. Landry Parish headquarters, boosting production capacity to supply First Solar Inc.’s new $1.1 billion manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish.

The company is expected to create 29 direct new jobs while retaining 56 current positions. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 52 indirect new jobs, for a total of 81 potential new jobs in the Acadiana Region.

“Noble Plastics’ expansion shows what’s possible when innovative Louisiana companies connect with leading American manufacturers like First Solar,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “This project means more jobs, more opportunity and more investment right here in Acadiana. My administration is committed to supporting homegrown businesses that are building a stronger, more robust economy for our people.”

The expansion project will add new manufacturing capabilities, warehousing and office space to Noble’s existing facility, enhancing its state-of-the-art lineup of robot-operated injection molding machines, in-line inspection and AI-powered monitoring systems.

“From Louisiana Growth Network programs to expansion projects fueled by partnerships with new companies coming to our state, Noble Plastics exemplifies LED’s mission in action,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Through our enhanced focus on supporting existing Louisiana businesses and sharing small business success stories, we look forward to working with Noble Plastics and others like it to create opportunities and grow prosperity in every corner of our state.”

As part of its domestic sourcing strategy, First Solar chose Noble Plastics to produce precision-molded components for the connection and energy transfer systems in its solar panels. Products made at Noble Plastics’s facility at 318 Burleigh Lane in Grand Coteau will then be shipped to First Solar’s site about 30 miles away in New Iberia.

“We’re thrilled with the opportunities to grow our team, our location, and support a more diverse range of clients right here in St. Landry Parish,” Noble Plastics President Missy Rogers said. “Our products enhance systems for the Department of Defense, the energy sector and industrial machinery industries both within and outside of Louisiana. This expansion extends our impact well beyond payroll and vendor spend – our participation with local schools, mentoring, and scholarships will grow as well.”

In September 2023, First Solar, the largest solar manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere, announced it would invest over $1 billion in its fifth U.S. manufacturing facility at the Acadiana Regional Airport. Scheduled to begin operations later this summer, the plant will produce the company’s uniquely American solar technology, and when fully ramped, is expected to create more than 800 direct jobs with an annual payroll exceeding $75 million.

“Noble Plastics brings the kind of technical precision, flexibility, and partnership we look for in our supply chain,” First Solar Chief Supply Chain Officer Mike Koralewski said. “Their proximity to our Louisiana facility, combined with their deep expertise in plastic molding, makes them a valuable contributor to our U.S. manufacturing ecosystem.”

Noble Plastics was founded in 2000 and has grown steadily to become a business leader in the Acadiana community while establishing a long history of involvement with LED Growth Network programs. The company is a graduate of the CEO Roundtables Program; the System for Integrated Growth strategic research program and the American Academy of Entrepreneurs mentorship program. It also participated in the Louisiana Workforce Commission’s Small Business Employee Training program.

“Noble Plastics’ expansion is a strong example of how local innovation and industry partnerships can drive meaningful growth for St. Landry Parish,” St. Landry Parish President Jessie Bellard said. “This investment not only supports job creation but strengthens our region’s role in the future of clean energy manufacturing. We’re proud to have Noble Plastics growing right here in our community.”

Noble anticipates starting construction in the third quarter of 2025 and completing the project at the end of 2026.

“St. Landry Economic Development (SLED) has had the privilege of playing a part in supporting Noble’s growth journey through the years to multiple locations in St. Landry Parish,” SLED CEO Bill Rodier said. “This expansion highlights yet another exciting chapter in their story. Noble is an exceptional community partner with progressive and dynamic leadership, so there are likely additional chapters to be written. We look forward to helping facilitate their continuing growth in the area for many years to come. “

To win the project in Grand Coteau, LED offered Noble Plastics a competitive incentives package that includes a $250,000 reimbursable grant from the Economic Development Award Program for infrastructure and equipment, subject to approval by the Louisiana Economic Development Corporation board. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and High Impact Jobs programs.

“One Acadiana is proud to see Noble Plastics’ expansion, which not only demonstrates their long-standing commitment to our region, but reinforces the positive economic impact of First Solar’s investment,” One Acadiana President and CEO Troy Wayman said. “Noble Plastics’ growth to support First Solar highlights the importance of a strong economic ecosystem and serves as a testament to the innovation happening in Acadiana.”

Kemp has journeyed twice to South Korea to meet with Hyundai and other big investors in Georgia, including electric battery maker LG Group.","ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has courted foreign investment to his state and has also talked so tough about immigration he once offered to use his own pickup truck to round up “criminal illegals.” Those key issues collided this past week when immigration authorities raided a battery plant and detained foreign workers, putting Kemp in a tough spot. Can he be both tough on immigration and encourage foreign companies to invest?

Some 475 people were detained in the raid, including more than 300 South Koreans, at the construction site for a battery plant that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution slated to open next year. The battery plant is part of a $7.6 billion complex planned to eventually employ 8,500 people. It was announced and then expanded after trips by Kemp to South Korea to court officials at Hyundai and other firms.

The detentions sparked questions in South Korea about its relationship with the United States, especially when Hyundai and its partners. Hyundai has said it’s investing $26 billion in the United States from 2025 to 2028. That includes not only the plant in Ellabell, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Savannah where Hyundai Motor Group makes electric vehicles, but a separate $5 billion battery joint venture in Cartersville, Georgia, a steel mill in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, a robotics hub and expansion of the Hyundai plant in Montgomery, Alabama and the Kia Corp. plant in West Point, Georgia.

Kemp has voiced support for immigration enforcement but been restrained in the raid’s aftermath.

“In Georgia, we will always enforce the law, including all state and federal immigration laws. All companies operating within the state must follow the laws of Georgia and our nation,” the governor’s office said Friday in a written statement.

Kemp can’t run again for governor in 2026 and passed up a U.S. Senate race, but has entertained talk of a 2028 run for president. He hasn’t yet said anything about whether the raid will have a long-term impact on Hyundai’s investments. On Friday, his office said only that the state Department of Public Safety had coordinated with ICE to support the raid.

Kemp’s office didn’t immediately respond to further questions Tuesday.

This is his second term as governor and he’s declared a goal of making Georgia the “ electric mobility capital of America. ” But the Republican has also talked tough on illegal immigration, saying in a 2018 ad that “I’ve got a big truck, just in case I’ve got to round up some criminal illegals and take them home myself,” and backing a state law that requires local jails to check the immigration status of prisoners.

The raid comes as Kemp has been aligning more closely with President Donald Trump’s administration on immigration enforcement and other issues. The governor has a long history of asserting his independence from Trump, which has at times led to headline-grabbing conflict. But Kemp last month announced he would mobilize 75 National Guard soldiers to provide support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Georgia. He followed that by announcing he would send more than 300 National Guard members to take part in Trump’s law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.

Like most governors, Kemp seeks foreign investment, which has built up most of the auto industry in the South. Kemp has journeyed twice to South Korea to meet with Hyundai and other big investors in Georgia, including electric battery maker LG Group.

Kemp disputes claims that tax dollars were subsidizing the jobs of those detained. His administration says none of the $2.1 billion in projected state and local incentives for the Hyundai complex directly benefits subcontractors who employ detainees.

“Without exception, the Department of Economic Development expects anyone doing business in Georgia to follow federal and state laws,” the department said.

Kemp has welcomed green energy investment and jobs, but has clashed with Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff over who should get credit for Georgia’s green energy boom.

Kemp sharply disputes that incentives signed by President Joe Biden spurred investment, saying industries were already coming to Georgia before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022. But if anything, the rush accelerated after Biden signed his climate law.

The 33 additional projects announced by the end of 2024 were the most nationwide, according to E2, an environmental business group. Exact figures differ, but projects in Georgia top $20 billion, pledging more than 25,000 jobs. Hyundai has continued investing even as Trump and congressional Republicans rolled back electric vehicle incentives.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/preview-713.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 20:03:23.777943

As said, the quartet of VW small electric cars will basically be the same.
And now, a thing or two about each of the four cars of the Electric Urban Car Family.
Alongside the reveal of the New Electric Urban Car Family and its current members (as more could join the fun train in the near future), Volkswagen also announced its business strategy for it.","This particular segment of the industry is one of the most lucrative on the Old Continent, and it's poised to become even more so in the near future. Citing undisclosed forecasts, VW says there will be a four times increase in demand for such vehicles in eight years' time than it is today.

Quite the incentive, then, for probably the world's largest carmaker to think seriously about having serious players in this segment. And, at the IAA, it revealed there will be four of them, riding into combat like the sons of Ragnar to conquer Europe.

The four models will be collectively called the Electric Urban Car Family, and they will arrive in 2026 with everything it takes to please small car buyers: decent performance levels, equipment usually found on more expensive cars, and a price to make them really attractive: around 25,000 euros (under $30,000).

The family comprises two models from the German Volkswagen brand, one from Spanish Cupra, and a fourth from Czech Skoda. All will be built on the same platform, an evolution of the Modularer E-Antriebs Baukasten platform called MEB+.

The cars will share pretty much everything, from chassis, battery, and electric motors to driver assistance systems, software, and technologies, but each of them will be designed in such a way that they speak to the fans of the respective brands.

The four vehicles I'm talking about are the VW ID. Polo hatchback (together with the ID. Polo GTI, the first electric car from this company to wear the fearsome designation), the VW ID. Cross SUV, the Cupra Raval hatchback, and the Skoda Epiq SUV.

Every single one of these vehicles is on the floor of the Munich show, but in different stages of development: some production-ready, others near-production, and even in the form of concepts. All of them, however, will make it into the world soon (more about each of them in the lines below).

As said, the quartet of VW small electric cars will basically be the same. The MEB+ platform used for them will see the deployment, for the first time, of a type of battery that uses unified cells and should be capable of giving the vehicles a maximum range of 280 miles (450 km). The battery will be capable of supporting DC fast charging.

Technologies seen on more pretentious models, including the new Travel Assist system with lane change function and traffic light recognition, the LED matrix lighting, and the smartphone as a key, will be available on each of them as well, despite the low starting price.

And now, a thing or two about each of the four cars of the Electric Urban Car Family. I'll start with the ID. Polo, because it is this one that will spearhead the offensive of its siblings.

The name might surprise you a bit, but it shouldn't, as VW announced last week it plans to give its electric cars the ""familiar designations of combustion-engine models."" Initially, the ID. Polo had been introduced two years ago as the ID. 2all.

The hatchback, far from being a Polo version with a different powertrain, should offer the more than decent range mentioned above, the space of a VW Golf, and even navigation with an integrated charging planner.

The ID. Cross, shown in concept form in Munich, follows the same recipe but blends all that with the body of a city SUV that looks quite aggressive. The same happens with the Skoda Epiq, but the lines on this one are a tad more toned down. Finally, the Cupra Raval copies the ID. Polo and gives it a more appealing shape for those with Latin blood running through their veins.

Alongside the reveal of the New Electric Urban Car Family and its current members (as more could join the fun train in the near future), Volkswagen also announced its business strategy for it. In a nutshell, the Germans plan to gain a market share in the small car segment of 20 percent, which should translate into several hundred thousand vehicles sold each year.

The family marks the carmaker's first serious offensive into this segment, meaning the cars to be sold will come on top of everything else it offers, not to cannibalize other VW models. Just to give you an idea of what that means, consider the fact that, without these four cars on the market, VW has already sold 3.5 million EVs since the electricity craze began in Wolfsburg some 6 years ago.

That's close to 600,000 cars per year, and in a market so competitive, quite the achievement. Imagine what four other models, attacking a new segment, will mean for the giant…",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/volkswagen-starts-small-car-segment-offensive-with-new-electric-urban-car-family-257136_1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 19:05:35.367239

Beyond the solid top-line numbers, however, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and recent Trump administration actions targeting solar “have significantly reduced deployment forecasts,” SEIA said in a Monday statement.

OBBBA, however, was generally seen as supportive of energy storage. Battery storage projects will have tax credits available through 2033, while the bill phased out solar and other incentives earlier.

The solar industry is also dealing with a Department of Interior memo noting that Secretary Doug Burgum will need to approve federal permits for solar projects, and new Treasury guidance that has altered the formal definition of “beginning of construction” for solar projects to earn federal tax credits.

SEIA and WoodMac’s low-case forecast concludes OBBBA and other policies put the United States at risk of losing 44 GW of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline compared to the outlook before the bill was passed. Compared to pre-OBBBA forecasts, the U.S. is “at risk of losing a total of 55 GW of solar deployment by 2030, a 21% decline,” the solar industry group said.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future,” SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid.”

Solar deployment is expected to be 4% lower than the pre-OBBBA base case by 2030, SEIA said. Near-term deployment “is bolstered by projects already underway, a rush to meet tax credit deadlines, and rising demand for power as new gas generation becomes more expensive and less available.”

Highlights from the report include:

The U.S. solar sector installed 7.5 GW-DC in the second quarter of this year, marking a 28% quarter-over-quarter increase but a 24% decline year over year;

Solar accounted for 56% of all new generating capacity added to the U.S. grid in the first half of 2025, while storage made up 26% and wind made up 10%. About 8% of the new capacity came from gas generation;

Texas solar generation additions led all states in the first half, with 3.8 GW-DC, followed by California, Indiana, and Arizona.

Installations continue, but federal policies are driving up costs following the Trump administration’s implementation of 10% baseline tariffs in April, the report found. “While a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs was announced, the baseline tariffs remained in effect and contributed to price increases across solar market segments,” it said.

Adrienne Hollis, vice president of environmental justice, health and community resilience and revitalization for the National Wildlife Federation, said the office is critical to coordinating environmental protection efforts in Maine and elsewhere.

“Some communities may file a complaint about the fact that, given the contamination they’re exposed to, there may be issues that violate the civil rights act,” Hollis pointed out. “Just as the air group, you need a focal point.”

Hollis noted some of the most vulnerable communities will be the most negatively affected by federal cuts.

“It’s going to affect the ability of communities and advocates and activists to really focus on these specific environmental outcomes that are related to systemic racism,” Hollis explained. “They’re place-based, they’re based on race, and they’re exacerbated by climate change.”

How to store power generated by wind and solar infrastructure Experts said wind and solar powered equipment, on their own, do not store energy.
Our ruling The Energy Department said, ""Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and when the wind is not blowing.""","President Donald Trump has made his wind power aversion well known. On at least five separate occasions recently, he called windmills ugly, expensive and altogether useless.

His Transportation Department canceled $679 million in federal funding that would have benefited offshore wind projects, and his Interior Department ordered work to stop on a major wind project off Rhode Island that was nearly finished.

The U.S. Energy Department chimed in with a Sept. 5 post on X.

""Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and when the wind is not blowing,"" the post said.

The following day, X users added a community note — a crowdsourced fact-check — to the post, saying the department was wrong because ""batteries allow electricity to be stored and used at a different time than when it is generated.""

Many of the energy experts we contacted agreed that wind and solar energy can be stored. They added that wind and solar power also have other advantages, beyond their zero carbon emissions once they start operating.

""That's like saying that a commercial aircraft is worthless when it isn't flying,"" said Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at the University of California-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. ""Obviously, any piece of capital equipment does not operate 100% of the time. The question is whether the value it creates when it is operating justifies the capital investment.""

Elon Musk, whose company Tesla manufactures batteries (and who owns X), replied to the post with the comment, ""Um … hello?"" and linked to an article about one of his battery products.

The Energy Department did not respond to an inquiry for this article.

How to store power generated by wind and solar infrastructure

Experts said wind and solar powered equipment, on their own, do not store energy. The process requires an extra step.

Batteries, as the X community note said, are one method.

""We now have increasingly widespread and affordable battery storage at the home and the utility scale,"" said Christopher R. Knittel, professor of energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. ""That allows renewable energy produced during the day to be stored and used at night or during demand spikes.""

Storage of wind and solar power is ""commonly done in California and Texas today, among other locations,"" Borenstein said, contributing ""significantly"" to the electricity supply.

Another option is to use wind and solar power to pump water into an elevated reservoir and release water when needed, harnessing the gravitational pull to power turbines, said Kenneth Gillingham, an economist with the Yale School of the Environment.

Adding storage capacity does require additional cost, which might make the overall competitiveness of wind or solar energy less favorable.

Batteries can help smooth out short-term supply and demand mismatches, but they are less economical for longer term use such as storage from one season to another, said Peter R. Hartley, a Rice University economist who specializes in energy policy.

Wind and solar power can be valuable additions to the energy mix

Even without a storage component, wind or solar power can still be valuable in any energy mix, experts said — beyond the benefit of producing carbon-free energy to combat climate change.

For instance, in New England, the natural gas supply is used heavily for heating, so there is less available for electricity during winter months. In the absence of other types of power, that would translate into high electricity prices, Gillingham said.

""Wind and solar can reduce the amount of electricity needed during many hours of the day,"" he said. This prevents utilities from having to switch over to more expensive fuels, such as fuel oil or diesel, he said.

""Solar power often coincides with peak daytime demand when electricity prices are highest, displacing expensive fossil generation and lowering overall costs,"" Knittel said.

Many states have made wind or solar important pieces of their energy strategy.

In May, about one-third of the electricity generated in Texas came from renewable energy other than hydropower, a category that includes wind and solar. In California, that percentage was just over half. In Iowa, the percentage was about two-thirds. Nationally, the share is about 14%.

""Far from being ‘worthless’ when conditions change, wind and solar are vital contributors to our energy system, delivering high value, clean power when it’s available, and, thanks to modern storage technologies, ensuring that power can continue to be used even when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing,"" Knittel said.

Our ruling

The Energy Department said, ""Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and when the wind is not blowing.""

Although wind energy infrastructure doesn’t produce power if the air isn’t moving and solar doesn’t generate power if the sun’s not out, those sources of energy still have value during those periods.

Energy can be stored either in batteries or in larger pieces of infrastructure such as reservoirs.

And when these systems are operational, they can handle electricity demand in real time, adding to the power mix in states including Texas, California and Iowa.

For Welch, the participant whose summer bills vanished due to solar energy, winter was a similarly affordable story thanks to her new solar-powered heat pump.","A new pilot program in Massachusetts gifted home solar panels to low-income residents — and the results were dramatic.

As Canary Media shared, the Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering installed free or low-cost solar panels at 55 participating households in Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard. And now, nearly a year and a half later, the preliminary results are in — and they're great.

""The results show that there are savings, and that energy burdens are reduced by more than 50%, when you pair it all with solar,"" said Maggie Downey, chief administrative officer of Cape Light Compact, who administered the program.

Third-party analysis found that the average pilot household slashed its net electricity use by nearly 60%, drawing much of its power from the solar panels instead. This has correlated to a $150/month average drop in energy costs.

""My costs are drastically lower,"" said Judy Welch, one Cape Cod homeowner and participant. ""In the summer now, I don't have any bills, and I have the air conditioning on the whole time.""

It's a great deal, but for many homeowners, finding a trusted solar installer is one of the most intimidating aspects of the process.

Fortunately, the free tools at EnergySage are an excellent place to start. The company offers free quote comparisons from a network of vetted installers, as well as a helpful mapping tool that breaks down average costs and available incentives on a state-by-state basis.

While several incentives are still available, many of the tax credits for solar panels and home appliance upgrades are expiring at the start of 2026.

Homeowners are only guaranteed the 30% tax credit on installations that are completed by the end of 2025, so acting sooner rather than later could mean a significant price difference — as much as $10,000, according to estimates from EnergySage.

There's also no better time to access affordable solar energy, as electricity costs are continuing to climb. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that the average electricity price in the U.S. would increase by 13% by the end of 2025.

Considering that electricity costs make up a major portion of the average home energy bill, eliminating them could mean significant savings. Specifically, in Cape Cod, lower-income households spent approximately 27% of their income on energy in 2023, according to the Department of Energy.

When homeowners pair solar panels with other electric appliances, such as efficient heat pumps, their energy bills drop even lower.

For Welch, the participant whose summer bills vanished due to solar energy, winter was a similarly affordable story thanks to her new solar-powered heat pump. She shared that she'd previously spent roughly $500 a month on electric baseboard heating.

Violations of California’s carpool lanes, also known as diamond lanes, or high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, carry fines of $490.
For more than 20 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles.
What’s the main argument in favor of letting the EV carpool program expire?
“We think it’s time to return carpool lanes to the carpools.","Sorry, EV drivers, you’re about to lose one of your most-coveted perks.

One of California’s longest-running incentives for people to buy electric cars — a program that provides access to carpool lanes regardless of how many people are in their vehicle — is coming to end. The Clean Air Vehicle decal program expires on Sept. 30.

After that, the colorful stickers that have given drivers of Teslas, Priuses, Leafs, Rivians, and other electric vehicles privileges to cruise along the carpool lane during commute times for nearly 25 years will be shut down and the special perks will end.

The details:

When will my EV carpool sticker expire?

Midnight on Sept. 30, statewide.

What happens if I am driving in a carpool lane during restricted hours with no passengers after that?

The CHP can pull you over and write you a ticket. Violations of California’s carpool lanes, also known as diamond lanes, or high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, carry fines of $490.

“Starting October 1, 2025, you must obey the posted vehicle occupancy requirement to travel in the carpool (HOV) lane or risk receiving a citation and fine,” the California Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement.

Why is this happening?

For more than 20 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles. The original idea was to provide incentives to sell the vehicles, which reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

But under the most recent version of the federal law, signed by President Obama in 2015, and called the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act,” those permissions expire on Sept. 30. Republicans who have majorities in the House and Senate have not reauthorized the program, and President Trump has taken steps this year already to end federal tax credits for electric vehicles, and to block a California law requiring all new vehicles sold in the state starting in 2035 be electric.

Can California do anything about it?

No. Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027. It passed with large bipartisan majorities in Sacramento. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law last September. But it won’t take effect unless Congress reauthorizes the program.

There are still three weeks left. Is there any chance Congress will save the program?

Not likely. There is an outside chance that House leaders could jam language at the last minute into a large continuing resolution as part of a compromise to keep funding the federal government after Sept. 30, but experts watching the issue don’t expect it.

“I would put the chances of reauthorization as very slim,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group.

Will my EV sticker still get me discounted or free tolls for bridges and in high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes?

No. Starting Oct. 1, the FasTrak CAV toll tag will automatically switch to a regular FasTrak Flex tag, and the driver will be charged full tolls for bridges and express lanes unless vehicles meet carpool occupancy rules.

What’s the main argument in favor of letting the EV carpool program expire?

When the program first began, after former Gov. Gray Davis signed AB 71, a law written by former Republican Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose in 1999, less than 2% of the cars on the road were electric. Last year in California, 25.3% of the new vehicles sold were electric, according to the California Energy Commission.

In some counties, the number is even higher. In Santa Clara County, a stunning 43.8% of new passenger vehicles purchased last year were “zero emission” — basically electric or plug-in hybrid. It was 31% in Orange County, and 26.5% in Los Angeles County.

“We think it’s time to return carpool lanes to the carpools. It’s fine for the program to expire,” said Magavern, whose group does not support the program continuing.

Who supports continuing the carpool perk?

Some environmental groups do, along with the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group of automakers, and the California Air Resources Board.

The air board argues that despite huge improvements in recent decades, California still has some of the nation’s dirtiest air (mostly in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley), and for the state to reach its clean air and greenhouse gas goals, more electric vehicles need to keep entering the roads.

What are the ramifications of this change? How will it affect traffic?

Nobody knows for sure. It could add more vehicles to the regular lanes, increasing traffic. It could cause more people to ride to work with others so they can stay in the carpool lane. It might further depress EV sales.

EV sales dipped this year, led by Tesla, the top-selling EV nationwide and in California, in part because many potential buyers in largely Democratic states where the most EVs are purchased are unhappy with Tesla CEO Elon Musk providing $250 million to President Trump’s campaign and helping him fire federal workers through his DOGE program.

Project Finance Most renewable energy projects are not on the books of a large company.
These contracts reduce costs, and economics again says that cheaper clean energy means more clean energy.","Right now, under the auspices of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol revision process, there is an ongoing debate about the importance of renewable energy credits, or “RECs.” As I discussed in an earlier blog post, RECs represent the attribute of clean energy, where a REC is considered a separate entity from the electricity itself. RECs are used by companies (and others) to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they associate with their electricity consumption. But electricity doesn’t flow from point to point, and the companies are not actually consuming clean electricity. Ultimately, a REC is just a piece of paper, so its connection to emissions reductions is unclear and a source of considerable controversy.

Part of that controversy lies in the value of a REC. To understand that value, one might start with how much a REC costs. When a buyer purchases a REC from a clean energy project, the purchase should improve the finances of the clean energy project. However, prices of RECs are quite low unless they are part of a long-term contract or are used to comply with state policies like a renewable portfolio standard. Given that there are transaction costs associated with RECs and considerable uncertainty about their future prices, it’s not clear how significant the revenue from these RECs could be to any given project.

But that isn’t the whole story. Looking solely at REC prices misses a significant way that RECs can be valuable: they encourage companies to enter into long-term bilateral contracts with clean energy developers.

Companies want to receive RECs as part of these long-term contracts, because they can use RECs to reduce their claimed emissions and contribute to achieving their climate goals. In return, these long-term contracts provide additional value to a renewable energy project by reducing the amount of risk the developers and their financiers must take on. This risk is effectively assumed by the company entering into the long-term contract with the clean energy developer.

Over the past few months, I have spoken with renewable energy developers to better understand how this risk-reduction process works in practice. The remainder of this blog post discusses what I learned about risk, how renewable projects are financed, and the role RECs play in managing both. I will conclude by discussing what this all means for the relationship between RECs and emissions reductions.

Project Finance

Most renewable energy projects are not on the books of a large company. Instead, developers create a new company for each project, sometimes called a special purpose vehicle. This is called “project finance.” Creating a separate corporation has advantages. First, for developers, it means that if the project fails to make its loan payments, the only recourse the lender has is limited to the assets of the project itself. This is called “nonrecourse debt.”

The special purpose vehicle also has advantages for lenders. In particular, the cash flows of the special purpose vehicle can be contractually obligated to be spent in a specified manner to increase the likelihood of debt repayment. More broadly, the ability to contractually allocate the risk of the project is the major advantage to using a special purpose vehicle.

Projects are usually financed with two types of money: equity and debt. Equity is the money that investors directly put into the project, and debt is the loans. Generally, debt is going to be cheaper than equity, in part because the interest is tax deductible, so the more debt financing a project has, the less expensive it will be. Banks, however, don’t like risk, so the amount of debt they are willing to provide (and the associated interest rate) will depend on how risky the project is.

Debt Coverage Ratios

One of the most important questions for a lender is whether the project will have enough cash each year, after paying operating expenses, to cover the loan payments. The more debt, the higher the loan payments, so the higher the revenue must be. However, revenue for a renewable energy project is uncertain, which mostly arises from the uncertainty in power prices and the uncertainty in the amount of generation, the latter of which depends on how hard the wind is blowing or whether the sun is shining.

Lenders can deal with this uncertainty in multiple ways. One is to use a very conservative estimate of the revenue. For example, while an equity investor might look at the median revenue projection, banks instead will base their calculations on the 90th or even the 99th percentile projection. This means that, when looking at the distribution of projected revenues over a given year, the lender will make decisions based on a revenue projection low enough so that 90 percent (or 99 percent) of all projections will be higher than that projection.

Lenders also require a buffer in calculating the cash flows to cover the loan payments. In other words, they don’t just ask that the 90th percentile revenue is enough to cover the loan payment; they require that the revenue must cover the loan payment multiplied by an extra factor called the debt service coverage ratio. (This is one of the most prominent coverage ratios used in project finance, but there are others.) The higher the level of the risk, the higher the ratio.

With the revenue projections and this ratio, one can calculate the maximum loan payment possible. This loan payment determines the size of the loan and (along with the interest rate) the cost of the debt. Lower risk means lower debt service coverage ratios, which means that a project can take on more debt, which in turn reduces costs.

Long-Term Contracts

A clean energy project developer has few avenues to reduce weather-related risks, but there are ways to reduce the risk associated with uncertain electricity prices. The most prominent option for a large electricity consumer, such as a company with a data center, is to enter into a long-term contract promising a fixed price for the electricity generated.

These contracts, called power purchase agreements, come in a few different forms (including so-called “virtual” purchase power agreements). Power purchase agreements create a fixed price for the power produced by the renewable generator, so the generator is not exposed to the variability of the current electricity price. Instead, that risk is taken on by the counterparty to the contract, such as the data center company. (Note that other types of derisking methods exist.)

By ensuring a fixed price for electricity, these contracts reduce the revenue risk for renewable generators. This derisking approach makes banks willing to accept lower debt coverage ratios, which enables a project to take on more debt and cheaper financing. Cheaper financing then translates into lower overall costs for the project. And lower costs mean more clean energy.

These long-term contracts are important for the electricity consumers, because the RECs transfer to the consumer under the contract. Without the REC, and the consequent ability to claim reduced emissions toward their climate goals, many potential electricity consumers would not necessarily be motivated to enter into these long-term contracts.

So, the importance of RECs is two-fold. RECs that are not part of long-term contracts and are sold on an open market are generally inexpensive, bringing less revenue to the project. However, the RECs associated with long-term contracts make clean energy cheaper by enabling more debt financing. The RECs associated with these long-term contracts have two types of implicit value: any price premium paid by the electricity consumer, and the reduction of financing costs.

Conclusion

Much of the controversy about the reductions in emissions associated with a REC focuses on the issue of additionality, or whether the renewable project would have occurred without the REC. This is an incredibly challenging question to answer because it involves understanding the counterfactual where the REC never existed. There are ways one could try to understand this counterfactual, but there will always be fundamental uncertainty in such a result.

It would go too far to say that all of the RECs associated with long-term contracts represent additional clean power, because at least some long-term clean power contracts would likely exist even in the absence of RECs. But if the presence of RECs means more people are willing to enter into long-term contracts, basic economics suggests that there will be more long-term contracts. These contracts reduce costs, and economics again says that cheaper clean energy means more clean energy. And, taking the syllogism to its conclusion, more clean energy means lower emissions. Even if we will never know how much exactly is due to the RECs.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2030424788_10_mb.width-600.png,N,,2025-09-09 17:04:50.169434

There’s still time to claim the credit on eligible vehicles, but you need to move quickly. That means signing a purchase contract and making payment—anything from a small down payment to a trade-in counts toward locking in the credit.

Whether you’re eyeing a sleek sedan, a roomy SUV, or a practical crossover, knowing which EVs and PHEVs qualify and what comes next after the deadline can help you make the most of the savings.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various authoritative sources, including FuelEconomy.gov, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the U.S. Department of Treasury.

Why the Federal Tax Credits Are Ending Soon

The long and short of it: federal EV tax credits are ending sooner than expected because of a budget reconciliation bill, officially called the ‘Inflation Reduction Act.’ While new and used EV credits were originally set to last until 2032, the legislation shortened the timeline, making September 30 the cutoff for many buyers.

What Makes an EV or PHEV Eligible for the Tax Credit

As it stands, the federal tax credit depends on several factors: where the EV or PHEV is made, where its battery components and minerals come from, the vehicle’s price, and the buyer’s income. In short, the car must be manufactured in North America and have an MSRP under $80,000 for SUVs or $55,000 for sedans, wagons, and hatchbacks.

To qualify for the first $3,750 of the credit, a portion of the vehicle’s battery components must be produced or assembled in North America. The second $3,750 requires that a portion of the critical minerals used in the battery be extracted or processed in the U.S., in a U.S. free trade partner country, or made from materials recycled in North America.

If a vehicle doesn’t currently qualify, you may still be able to claim the credit by leasing instead of buying. PHEVs are eligible, but standard hybrids are not. To complicate matters, these rules don’t apply to leased EVs or PHEVs, so leasing can be a way to get the credit on an otherwise ineligible vehicle—but this “leasing loophole” also disappears on September 30.

Tax Credits for Leased EVs and PHEVs

Most traditional leases currently qualify for a $7,500 commercial tax credit, which isn’t subject to the same requirements as the consumer new-vehicle credit. When you lease, the dealer receives the credit—not you—and it’s up to them to pass those savings along by lowering the vehicle’s price.

Even EVs made outside North America—like the Hyundai Ioniq 5—or higher-priced models such as the Lucid Air can take advantage of this credit, as long as the dealer passes it along. Make sure to ask for an itemized bill showing how the credit was applied, and double-check that the dealership hasn’t bumped up the price to offset it.

How Buyers Can Take Advantage of the EV Tax Credit

Eligibility for the tax credit is determined by each individual vehicle, not just the model. It might sound confusing, but automakers submit the vehicle identification numbers (VINs) of qualifying cars to the IRS, and only those vehicles are eligible for the credit.

Most dealerships automatically apply the credit during the purchase, but if they don’t, you can claim it later by submitting IRS Form 8936 when filing your taxes.

How Your Income Affects Federal EV and PHEV Credits

As mentioned earlier, your income also affects eligibility. For a new car tax credit, households can have an adjusted gross income of up to $300,000. Heads of household must earn less than $225,000, and individual filers qualify only if their income is under $150,000. Keep in mind, these limits may not apply if the vehicle is leased.

Which EVs and PHEVs Qualify for the Tax Credit

The Treasury Department maintains an official list of eligible vehicles, but we’ve rounded up the key ones below. Keep in mind that sometimes only specific trim levels or model years qualify, and the list can change as manufacturers submit updated information about their vehicles.

Claiming Credit on Pre-owned EVs

Think you have to buy new to get a tax break? Think again—used EVs can qualify, too, though the rules are a bit different.

If you’re buying a used EV from an authorized dealership, you may be eligible for a credit of $4,000 or 30 percent of the sale price, whichever is less. But there are a few catches: the car can’t have been resold after August 16, 2022, so a one-owner vehicle sold at a dealership could qualify, while a two-owner car or a private sale won’t.

The income limits are lower for used EV buyers: $150,000 for joint filers, $112,500 for heads of household, and $75,000 for individuals. On the bright side, there’s no need to worry about where the car was made or where its battery components came from—those rules don’t apply to used vehicles.

To wrap things up, just because these credits are ending soon doesn’t mean you should rush into a purchase without thinking. That said, if you’ve done your homework and found an EV or PHEV that fits your needs and budget, it makes sense to act sooner rather than later.",https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/newmodely_58-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-09 16:01:56.850655

(September 9, 2025) - Public interest advocates from across the Midwest filed a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) today, urging it to reject a complaint that would stall efforts to add 24 new power lines in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The new lines would save customers between $26 billion and $83 billion over the next 40 years while improving reliability in the face of increasing weather extremes and rising energy demands from data centers and other industries.

Nearly a year after the portfolio of new power lines for the Upper Midwest was approved by MISO — and after years of state and stakeholder input and review informing the plan — a small group of mostly unaffected states in the Gulf South portion of MISO suddenly brought a complaint designed to derail implementation.

A coalition of organizations argue that the complaint seeks to unsettle the result of a years-long planning process that will provide billions in benefits to consumers and enable badly needed new generation to connect to the grid. If granted, the baseless complaint would make it much harder to build transmission lines anywhere in the United States. The coalition includes Clean Wisconsin, Environmental Defense Fund, Fresh Energy, Sierra Club, Solar Energy Industries Association, Sustainable FERC Project, Union of Concerned Scientists, and NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council).

The organizations that filed the protest offer the following statements:

“We are fighting for families across the Midwest who need more affordable energy,” said Casey Roberts, Director of RTO Advocacy, Climate & Energy, at NRDC. “These new transmission lines help connect new sources of cheaper and cleaner power to the customers who need it. This complaint is a short-sighted effort by a group of states that have little to no skin in the game to deprive consumers in other states of these benefits. FERC should deny this complaint, which seeks to make it impossible to build new transmission lines anywhere in the U.S. This would hold up new power projects, making the grid less reliable, and electricity more expensive.”

“The power lines identified through MISO’s process to plan for the grid of the future, which took two years of collaboration and analysis, are needed now more than ever in this time of rapid change in the electricity sector” says Ciaran Gallagher, Energy & Air Manager at Clean Wisconsin. “This complaint is a threat to cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable electricity, not just for Midwesterners but all Americans. If FERC does not deny this complaint, then the needed long-term transmission planning will stop in its tracks across the country.”

“As our electricity grid expands and demand for electricity goes up, we must build out more transmission, for the same reason that growing children need new shoes,” said Greg Wannier, Senior Attorney with the Sierra Club. “Interrupting MISO’s well-vetted and conservative transmission planning process will create significant short-term and long-term problems for the region and will undermine grid reliability and energy affordability. We simply cannot have American energy dominance if FERC sides with the commissions that brought this frivolous challenge.”

“Transmission expansion along the lines of MISO's LRTP Tranche 2.1 enable both our country’s advancement of cheap clean energy and ability to remain economically competitive on a global scale,” said Mike Schowalter, Director for RTO Advocacy at Fresh Energy. “At a time when our nation’s heartland is poised to become a leading, clean industrial center of the globe, the complainants ask FERC that we step backwards and let other countries take the lead. Additionally, being centrally located in the middle of the Eastern Interconnection, MISO’s LRTP Tranche 2.1 further enhances our country’s resilience and ability to respond to the type of energy emergencies that MISO’s neighbors have recently experienced to the east and west.”

Background:

MISO approved a historic transmission plan in December 2024 that would benefit Midwestern consumers with lower energy costs and a stronger and modernized electrical grid. The MISO transmission plan benefits consumers with enhanced reliability, clean energy sources, and reduced long-term energy costs.

The portfolio of 24 power lines in the upper Midwest – called “Tranche 2.1” -- was planned by MISO to facilitate the energy resource plans of utilities and states, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Montana. The lines are vital to enabling development of nearly 116 gigawatts of new generation – mainly solar, wind and battery storage — to come online economically and reliably at a time of growing demand for power.

MISO’s plan, detailed in its MTEP24 Report, includes three distinct groups of projects: Tranche 2.1 portfolio, the Joint Targeted Interconnection Queue (JTIQ) portfolio, and a portfolio comprising local initiatives. It projects to provide between $26 billion and $83 billion in net benefits to consumers regionwide over 40 years.

The coalition’s petition argues that the complaint largely fails to recognize how efficient regional transmission planning is conducted. MISO planned the grid based on the resource plans of utilities and states all across the upper Midwest – from Michigan to Indiana to Iowa to North Dakota to Wisconsin. Most of the states who filed the complaint, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, are not involved in paying or benefiting in any way in Tranche 2.1. Some of these are states have often sought to block and stall regional transmission progress because their monopoly utility Entergy doesn’t want access opened to power it doesn’t own or profit from.

Building more transmission lines is one of the most cost-effective ways to cope with data centers’ and AI’s rising demand for electricity. Expanding the grid with new power lines will bolster reliability in the face of severe weather and provide greater access to renewables, which are the cheapest sources of electricity. The Tranche 2.1 lines will do just that – saving upper Midwest households more than $16 billion just by avoiding the need to build about 20 big new power plants.

We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.","When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, it was the largest climate bill in U.S. history, with major incentives for electric vehicle production and adoption. In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A virtuous – or vicious – cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors – power generation and transportation – while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

Vestas Wind Systems A/S shares jumped on Monday, August 18, after guidance issued by US government agencies brought much-anticipated clarity to the rules on how clean energy projects can qualify for tax credits and were more straight-forward than feared.

Shares rose as much as 18%, the steepest intraday gain since July 2022 in Copenhagen. The guidance is the last hurdle that investors need to move forward with renewable investments including wind. The rules are less stringent than many analysts were expecting and could open up a wave of wind turbine orders for Vestas.

Certainty on the scope of President Donald Trump’s tax bill had already eased a bottleneck for new wind turbine orders in the US. And this guidance on the bill’s implementation could spur more developers to buy turbines knowing they can start construction soon enough to qualify for tax credits.

“People have been lining up and waiting for policy clarity,” Vestas Chief Executive Officer, Henrik Andersen said last week on Bloomberg TV.

Wind and solar assets that start generating after Dec. 31 2027 don’t get a tax credit unless construction begins by July 4 2026, which could mean a rush to start building. Eligibility is measured by physical work carried out at the site, not by investment, according to the guidance.

The so-called “safe harbor” rule has been eliminated, where developers can delay physical work by paying at least 5% of the costs but projects with existing safe harbor will be allowed to retain it.

The construction start milestone is “far less onerous than any stricter rules that had been widely feared,” according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.

Vestas is a major supplier to wind farm developers in the US, where Trump has cut back support for the power source since his election. The outlook for wind power is still dimmer than it was under former President Joe Biden but the guidance gives investors clarity that at least for the next few years, the situation is not as bad as it could have been.

“We see close to the best possible outcome in the guidance compared to initial talks,” analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note.

The jump in the share price advance added the equivalent of about $3 billion to the company’s market value, taking it to more than $21 billion. Other European renewables stocks also strengthened on the news. EDP Renovaveis SA climbed as much as 6.9%, Nordex SE advanced as much as 4.4% and Orsted AS rose 4.1%.

USDOT RFI on AV Deployment Research Support

On August 18, 2025, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) published a Request for Information (RFI) on ""research ideas to support nationwide automated vehicle (AV) deployment."" The purpose of the RFI is to seek input from industry and stakeholders to assist the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R) in developing a research agenda to facilitate safe nationwide deployment of Automated Driving Systems (ADS).

In the RFI, USDOT stated that it is seeking information from ""industry, technology developers, operators of ADS vehicle fleets, State/local transportation agencies, researchers and other stakeholders[.]"" The RFI focuses on the software and data needs of AV deployment, requesting information on ""technical, data, and resource needs to improve the ability of software-driven AV systems[.]"" USDOT is requesting comments on:

Data Standards and Integration

Edge Case Characteristics Identification

Supervision Dynamics and Human Interaction

Evidence Based Evaluation

Transparency and Building Public Understanding of Variations in AV Impacts on the Transportation System and

Evaluation of Consistent and Robust Vehicle Behavior Interactions with Other Road Users and the Transportation System

Comments on the RFI are due October 17, 2025. This RFI is distinct from USDOT's request for information on the Surface Transportation Reauthorization bill, which is detailed below.

FHWA Releases Updated NEVI Formula Program Guidance

On August 11, 2025, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) released an updated Interim Final Guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. This interim final guidance is effective immediately, but FHWA also published a request for comments and will consider whether any further changes are needed based on public comments it has received.

Updated State Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Deployment Plans are due within 30 days of the notice and must include:

A description of how the State intends to use NEVI Program funds for each fiscal year, covering all unobligated funding for fiscal years 2022-2026

A Community Engagement Outcomes Report (per 23 CFR 680.112(d)) and

A description of physical and cybersecurity strategies (per 23 CFR 680.106(h))

Additional changes to the previous NEVI guidance, issued June 11, 2024, include:

Providing States with the flexibility to determine the appropriate distance between stations along alternative fuel corridors to allow for reasonable travel

Encouraging selection of charging locations where the charging station owners are also the site host to accelerate project delivery and

Providing States with more flexibility in determining when their system is built out allowing NEVI funds to be used on public roads statewide

NEVI funds had temporarily been frozen by USDOT following President Trump's January 20, 2025 executive order, ""Unleashing American Energy."" On June 24, 2025, Judge Tana Lin in the Western District of Washington issued a preliminary injunction ordering USDOT to restore NEVI funding for 14 states, which took effect on July 2, 2025. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia had sued the Trump administration following the executive order, stating that the freeze impacted pre-prepared plans to deploy EV charging stations. The injunction was granted to California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wisconsin, Delaware, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Hawaii, and Illinois.

NHTSA Issues First Exemption for American-Built Automated Vehicles

On August 6, 2025, USDOT announced that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had issued the first demonstration exemption under the recently expanded Automated Vehicle Exemption Program (AVEP). The exemption is the first to be issued for American-built vehicles under the program. The AVEP previously included only imported AVs, but USDOT expanded the program in April to also include domestically produced AVs. The announcement of adjustments to the current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) exemption process was made in a letter signed by Peter Simshauser, chief counsel, NHTSA. The letter states that NHTSA will now begin to accept and process requests for vehicles built in the United States to receive FMVSS exemptions for non-commercial purposes that involve research or demonstration in accordance with 49 U.S.C. § 30114(a), opening up the current 49 CFR Part 591 exemption process for foreign vehicles to domestically built vehicles as well.

This action is part of the AV Framework NHTSA announced in April 2025. Part of Secretary Duffy's transportation innovation agenda, the AV Framework is intended to support American ingenuity, maintain key safety standards, and prevent a patchwork of state laws and regulations. The Framework is centered on three principles: (1) Prioritize Safety; (2) Unleash American Innovation; and (3) Enable Commercial Deployment. The key policy actions in the AV Framework include (1) revisions to the Standing General Order on Incident Reporting for Automated Driving Systems (ADS) and Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and (2) creating a process for NHTSA to accept and review requests for vehicles built in the U.S. to receive Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) exemptions for non-commercial purposes that involve research or demonstration.

USDOT Request for Information on ""Advancing a Surface Transportation Proposal that Focuses on America's Most Fundamental Infrastructure Needs""

On July 21, 2025 USDOT published a request for information (RFI) on the forthcoming surface transportation reauthorization (STR) bill to solicit ideas from industry and the public on projects and priorities the department could push Congress to include in the reauthorization bill. In the RFI, USDOT requests comments related to the four major policy ""themes of importance"" the Department has identified:

Enhancing transportation safety. USDOT seeks to improve safety measures in areas related to bridges, transportation workers and pedestrians, truck parking, and AVs

Accelerating project delivery for transportation projects. The RFI emphasized ongoing projects, including reforming the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and permitting, enhancing One Federal Decision, and increasing the use of technology

Increasing investment opportunities. The RFI states that investment in transportation infrastructure should promote economic growth, specifically through expanded capacity and mobility, congestion relief, and private sector investment and

Strengthening partnerships. The RFI noted the importance of improving partnerships with States and other key stakeholders to improve transportation outcomes and efficiency

Comments on the RFI are due September 8, 2025.

NHTSA Publishes Report to Congress on ADS-Equipped Vehicles

At the beginning of July, NHTSA published its second biannual report summarizing the agency's research and rulemakings associated with Automated Driving Systems (ADS). The report outlined USDOT's regulatory framework for AVs and Secretary Duffy's innovation agenda, highlighting NHTSA's cooperation in streamlining its research and rulemaking activities to effectively support the framework's objectives.

The report provided the following updates on NHTSA's ADS Research:

Progress on a multiphase project evaluating 81 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for their applicability to innovative vehicle designs, especially those with ADS

A recently conducted safety assessment examining how simulation and augmented reality tools can be an effective resource to support ADS-equipped safety evaluation

Continued research analyzing the benefits and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) models within ADS

Research conducted on the crashworthiness of new ADS-equipped vehicle designs using Human Body Models and Advance Crash test dummies, in addition to research regarding best practices for safe interactions between non-occupied ADS-equipped vehicles with existing vehicles, roadside hardware, pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists and

Continued research regarding mobility and the information needs of all people riding in ADS-equipped vehicles, including those with varying disabilities and those using wheelchairs

The report also included an update on NHTSA's ADS rulemakings, stating that the agency is analyzing previously submitted comments on various NPRMs to determine next steps for developing further regulations.

USDOT Releases a Report on FMVSS Considerations for ""ADS-Dedicated Vehicles""

On July 1, 2025, the Department of Transportation published a report, ""FMVSS Considerations for Vehicles With Automated Driving Systems: Volume 3."" This report extensively details various options for technical translations of 28 different FMVSS, including crash avoidance standards, low-speed vehicles, and crashworthiness standards, for ""ADS-dedicated vehicles that lack manually operated driving controls."" USDOT published two previous ""volumes"" in 2020 and 2021 that initially established the framework used to evaluate the regulatory barriers to be removed for verifying ADS-dedicated vehicles' compliance with FMVSS. However, this report includes the caveat that ""the legality of the potential options discussed . . . [has] not yet been verified[, and] [does] not include all translation possibilities for the FMVSS or test procedures.""

USDOT Announces Several Actions to Support Truck Drivers

On June 27, 2025, USDOT announced a series of new initiatives, pilot programs, and regulatory updates intended to support America's truck drivers. The package comes in response to President Trump's April 28, 2025 executive order, ""Enforcing Commonsense Rules of the Road for America's Truck Drivers."" Secretary Duffy emphasized that these actions underscore USDOT's commitment to support America's truck drivers and improve overall roadway safety.

The package includes several updates that USDOT states are designed to provide regulatory flexibility for truck drivers. This includes the withdrawal of a joint rulemaking from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that proposed mandating speed limiters on heavy-duty trucks. Additionally, FMCSA is proposing a deregulatory initiative to eliminate what the announcement describes as burdensome regulations on the trucking industry.

In addition to the deregulatory actions, USDOT will advance more than $275 million in grant funding to expand truck parking availability, launch new digital assets in order to modernize driver resources, including updating the DataQ system and the National Consumer Complaint Database, and initiate two pilot programs to study increased flexibility in hours-of-service regulations.

Other Federal Agencies

EPA Proposes to Repeal Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards

On August 1, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. EPA states that Clean Air Act (CAA) section 202(a) does not authorize the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns and, on that basis, is proposing to rescind the 2009 findings that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare. EPA further proposes to rescind the 2009 findings because the agency states that it previously ""unreasonably"" analyzed the scientific record and more recent developments cast ""significant doubt"" on the reliability of the findings. Last, EPA is proposing to repeal all GHG emission standards on the basis that no technology for vehicle and engine emission control can address the global climate change concerns identified in the findings without risking greater harms to public health and welfare. Comments on this proposed rule close on September 15, 2025.

White House

Spring 2025 Unified Regulatory Agenda Released

On September 4, 2025, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs released the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda), which reports on the regulations and actions administrative agencies plan to issue in the near and long term and provides status updates on ongoing agency rulemakings.

The Unified Agenda includes three new rulemakings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) related to Automated Driving Systems (ADS). These rulemakings would amend certain Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to address ADS-equipped vehicles with no manual controls. The FMVSS to be amended are:

FMVSS No. 102, ""Transmission shift position sequence, starter interlock and transmission braking effect.""

FMVSS No, 103, ""Windshield defrosting and defogging systems,"" and FMVSS No. 104, ""Windshield wiping and washing systems.""

FMVSS No. 108, ""Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment.""

Another notable motor vehicle-related rulemaking introduced in the Unified Agenda is an Interim Final Rule, anticipated in September 2025, on ""Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain: Medium- and Heavy-Duty Connected Vehicles,"" from the Department of Commerce, building on an existing rule governing passenger vehicles.

White House Releases AI Action Plan and Three AI-Related Executive Orders

On July 23, 2025, the White House released its AI Action Plan (the Plan) that details the Trump administration's policy priorities on artificial intelligence (AI). These actions follow from Executive Order 14179, which removed the Biden-era executive orders on AI policy and instead directed the development of an AI Action Plan that would ""sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security."" The Plan recommends policy actions based on three ""pillars"": (1) boosting the industry's development and deployment of AI tools through deregulation, government programs for innovation, and leveraging AI for research; (2) expanding data centers, semiconductor manufacturing, and energy infrastructure, primarily through expedited permitting processes and removing regulatory hurdles; and (3) ""succeed[ing] in the global AI competition,"" particularly against China. The Plan offers express support for the development and scaling of drones, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, through federal programs and grants for small businesses and defense research, and through engagement with stakeholders. The Plan recommends that agencies ""explore leveraging new and existing location verification features on advanced AI computers to ensure that the chips are not in countries of concern."" Finally, the Plan urges federal agencies to consider limiting the disbursement of ""AI-related discretionary funding"" for states with ""AI regulatory regimes that may hinder the effectiveness of that funding or award.""

On the same day President Trump signed three executive orders directing several agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Small Business Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of the Interior, to implement some of the policy actions recommended in the Plan.

Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Nomination Hearings for Key USDOT Positions

The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee convened two hearings in July to consider the nominations for several USDOT positions. On July 16, 2025, the Committee considered the nominations for modal administrators of USDOT. Nominees included (1) Derek Barrs to be Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA); (2) Jonathan Morrison to be Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA); and (3) Paul Roberti to be Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). On July 23, 2025, the Committee considered the nominations for additional positions within USDOT. Nominees included (1) Seval Oz to be Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Research and Technology; (2) Michael Rutherford to be Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Multimodal Freight, Infrastructure, and Policy; and (3) Gregory Zerzan to be General Counsel of the Department of Transportation.

Automotive innovation, AVs, and American competitiveness received significant attention throughout both hearings. In his opening statement on July 23, Chairman Ted Cruz (R-TX) emphasized that the U.S. is facing a new era of transportation driven by AVs, smart infrastructure, and artificial intelligence, and that USDOT must modernize regulations and enhance safety standards.

On July 30, 2025, the Committee voted to advance the nominations of Derek Barrs, Jonathan Morrison, Paul Roberti, Michael Rutherford, and Gregory Zerzan to the full Senate for consideration. The nomination of Seval Oz will be considered by the Committee on a later date.

Legislative Updates

Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill

On July 17, 2025, the House Appropriation Committee advanced the Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (House THUD Appropriations) by a vote of 35 to 28. The bill provides a discretionary total of $22.097 billion to USDOT, resulting in a total of $105.078 billion in budgetary resources in combination with $83.285 billion in obligation limitation for highway and airport trust fund programs.

The House THUD Appropriations report incorporates several measures related to AVs, including a directive to the Secretary of Transportation to establish a national framework for the regulation of AV technologies. In the report the Committee also encourages the Secretary of Transportation to update Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to accommodate AVs and to consider launching a public education initiative regarding AVs.

On July 24, 2025, the Senate Appropriations Committee advanced the Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Senate THUD Appropriations) by a vote of 27-1. The Senate bill appropriates $26.5 billion in discretionary funding to USDOT, marking an increase from the House THUD Appropriations.

The Senate THUD Appropriations report contains several notable provisions impacting the automotive industry, including a $13,900,000 appropriation for NHTSA's Office of Automation Safety to support the safe deployment of AVs. In the report the Committee also directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue new guidance on the NEVI formula program. FHWA issued new guidance after the Senate appropriations report was published.

When Congress returns in September, the House and Senate will need to reconcile their respective versions of the bill to pass them by the start of the new fiscal year on October 1 to avoid a government shutdown.

Reconciliation Bill Signed into Law

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (H.R. 1) into law, successfully advancing his signature policy legislation. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 51-50, with Vice President J.D. Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, on July 1, 2025. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 218-214 on July 3, 2025. Two House Republicans, Representatives Thomas Massie (KY) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA), along with three Senate Republicans, Rand Paul (KY), Susan Collins (ME), and Thom Tillis (NC), joined Democrats in voting against the bill.

The reconciliation package includes several rollbacks of clean energy incentives impacting the automotive industry that were passed in President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act:

The termination of Section 30D tax credits for purchasing or leasing a new electric vehicle (EV), Section 25E tax credits for purchasing a used EV, and Section 45W tax credits for purchasing a qualified commercial clean vehicle by September 30, 2025 and

The elimination of Section 30C tax credits for EV charging infrastructure by June 30, 2026

The Senate stripped out a previously introduced provision creating new registration fees on EVs and hybrid vehicles.

The company beat Elon Musk’s Tesla in bringing an EV pickup truck to the market, but has yet to prove it can succeed without massive taxpayer help.

The LA Times reports that Rivian, the electric truck and SUV manufacturer based in Irvine, California, has recently announced the layoff of about 200 employees, equivalent to 1.5 percent of its total workforce of nearly 15,000. The company’s decision comes as it braces for the expiration of federal EV tax credits at the end of the month, a move that is expected to dampen demand for electric vehicles across the industry.

Under President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and the credit of up to $4,000 for used EVs are set to end, reversing Biden-era efforts to make EVs more attractive to Americans, who have not embraced the technology in favor of traditional gas vehicles. This abrupt policy change has prompted several automakers, including General Motors and Volkswagen, to cut jobs and slow production in anticipation of reduced consumer interest in EVs.

Breitbart News previously reported that Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe once compared buying a gas-powered car to “building a horse barn in 1910.”

In 2023, the troubled company lost an astounding $33,000 for every electric truck it sold:

Rivian’s vehicles, with an average selling price exceeding $80,000, have not resulted in profits. In fact, the company suffered a loss of $33,000 on every vehicle sold in the second quarter. The financial strain is evident, but Rivian Founder and Chief Executive RJ Scaringe claims, “We’re competing to build something that’s truly better than all the alternatives, and to try to do that on a limited budget would be detrimental to us achieving our mission.”

Rivian’s journey has been marked by a juxtaposition of financial success and operational struggles. The company made a splash in the market with its IPO in 2021, raising nearly $12 billion and momentarily achieving a valuation surpassing some established automakers. However, the operational side painted a different picture. Rivian grappled with manufacturing troubles, burning through half of its $18 billion cash pile in two years and operating at less than one-third of its build capacity. The company’s ambitious launch of three models in quick succession further complicated the production dynamics.

This self-sabotage came to a head on July 25 when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the EPA would be rescinding the scientific finding that greenhouse gas emissions are harmful air pollution, a concept formally called the “Endangerment Finding.”

This article aims to delve deeper into this troubling action, explaining in simple terms what the EPA’s action entails and what we can do as Americans to oppose this egregious proposal.

Context: What’s Going On At EPA These Days?

It’s impossible to understand the Endangerment Finding recission proposal without first understanding the broader context of what is happening at the EPA under President Trump.

As we profiled in another recent article, under the Trump administration, the EPA’s leadership has become stacked with former lobbyists and lawyers for polluting industries, creating a situation where the fox is dangerously guarding the henhouse. In the past six months, high-level positions at the EPA have been filled by individuals who previously worked for the chemical industry trade group, the oil and gas industry trade group, and various oil, chemical, pipeline, and energy companies. These political appointees have been methodically enacting an agenda to give free rein to corporate polluters. This agenda will harm people’s health and the environment with impunity by sabotaging the EPA’s willingness and abilities to carry out its sole mission: to protect people and the environment. They are eliminating rules to prevent polluters from harming the environment; giving a free pass to corporate polluters; and stripping the agency of its ability to do research, enforce environmental rules, or fund environmental programs.

The current proposal to eliminate the Endangerment Finding, and thus sabotage the EPA’s regulatory authority, can only start to make any sense when it’s understood that EPA’s current political leadership is not as interested in protecting people and the environment as it is in protecting the profits of polluting industries.

What is the Endangerment Finding?

The Endangerment Finding is a cornerstone of the body of law that allows the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change. It can be considered an extension of the Clean Air Act, which states that the EPA shall establish limits on any air pollutant that causes or contributes to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, a series of legal proceedings ended up at the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gas emissions are indeed air pollutants according to the Clean Air Act, and that the EPA has the legal authority to regulate them, and thus an obligation to establish pollution limits if they are a danger. The court also ordered the EPA to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions reach the legal threshold of being reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.

The EPA subsequently undertook a rigorous process to document the large body of scientific understanding about greenhouse gas emissions’ effect on climate change and impact on people, and formalized their decision in 2009, when the EPA published the Endangerment Finding. The publication of the Endangerment Finding put the EPA on the record officially determining that “six greenhouse gases taken in combination endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.”

With the Supreme Court’s decision that the EPA has the authority and obligation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and the EPA’s finding that greenhouse gas emissions indeed endanger the public, the stage was set for the EPA to establish limits on greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas operations.

What is the EPA’s Current Proposal?

On July 25, Administrator Zeldin announced that the EPA was moving to eliminate the Endangerment Finding completely. This move was not a surprise. Zeldin previously announced that he would target the Finding, which was a specific target of the Project 2025 anti-government playbook last year. What was, however, surprising to many experts once the written proposal was made public, was the array of arguments the EPA used to try to justify such a move, including the claim that the EPA does not have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases at all under the Clean Air Act – essentially the same argument that the Supreme Court rejected in 2007 and later stuck to in multiple subsequent court cases. But in case that argument fails in court, the EPA is also offering other demonstrably false reasons for their proposal, including that climate warming really isn’t necessarily all that bad, and also that even if climate change is truly harmful to Americans, the cost of climate regulations outweighs the benefits.

Learn more about the EPA’s proposal:

A Legal Analysis of the Trump EPA’s Plan to Revoke the Endangerment Finding by Earthjustice

EPA’s Proposal to Eliminate the Endangerment Finding and Motor Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Regulations by the Harvard Environmental and Energy Law Program

Why Does This Proposal Matter?

Climate change is causing staggering harm to people and the environment, and the harm is only growing. The federal government absolutely has a responsibility to do what it can to help us protect ourselves from these harms, and EPA limits on climate pollution under the Clean Air Act are the most effective tool that the executive branch has at its disposal to do so.

By rescinding the Endangerment Finding, the EPA could undo federal limits on greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles, power plants, and the oil and gas industry. Depending on how courts rule on the legal challenges that will no doubt be filed against this action, it’s possible that a future presidential administration could reinstate a new endangerment finding, or it’s even possible that the rescission could end up barring future administrations from establishing any limits on harmful greenhouse gas pollution under the Clean Air Act.

In an interesting twist, legal experts have raised the possibility that if the EPA declines to regulate greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level, individual corporate polluters such as power utilities may get exposed to legal liability and get sued for their climate pollution. Companies have had the benefit of a legal shield since the EPA has taken responsibility for regulating greenhouse gas emissions across the nation, but that defense may go away if the EPA goes through with rescinding the Endangerment Finding.

SACE’s Take

As expressed in an organizational statement SACE issued upon the announcement of this proposal, President Trump, Administrator Zeldin, and the political decision makers at EPA are recklessly undermining our ability to stave off the worst impacts of climate change, even as we’re paying the price of intensifying flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and extreme heat. The number of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters — like Hurricanes Helene, Irma, and Milton — has skyrocketed, with the last ten years accounting for nearly half of the costs of such disasters over the entire 44-year period that records have been kept.

SACE’s Executive Director, Dr. Stephen A. Smith, said in our statement:

The Trump administration is recklessly undermining the rules and agencies established to protect Americans’ health and our environment, while at the same time gaslighting Americans by telling us that climate disruption isn’t a threat. We can see with our own eyes the parade of horribles of repeating record-breaking climate disasters. We know that 2024 was the hottest year on record by a wide margin, and each of the last ten years has been the hottest year on record. We’ve had more flash flood warnings in 2025 than ever before, driven by climate warming, and we’ve seen far too many families and communities, such as those in the Texas floods and Hurricane Helene’s path across the Southeast, face the deadly and tragic consequences. It defies logic and common sense for the Trump administration to remove the foundational pillars of our pollution rules when the EPA’s sole job is to protect the people and places we love.

Contrary to Administrator Zeldin’s hopes, the American people are not so gullible that we will be deceived to put blinders on to the climate chaos that is happening all around us.

The EPA must scrap this reckless proposal.

For Illinois families interested in getting EVs, this timing couldn’t be more significant. EV users spend significantly less on fuel and maintenance compared to what’s spent on traditional gasoline vehicles, with savings of over $1,500 annually based on average driving habits and electricity prices. This is also because EVs eliminate the need for oil changes, timing belt replacements and exhaust system repairs.

Congressional action to end these credits prematurely undermines U.S. competitiveness, threatens local jobs within the EV industry and strips residents of the choice to purchase EVs cost-effectively.

Higher ed attacks are more than a diatribe

I write with two purposes: first, to compliment the Sun-Times and reporters Mary Norkol and Selena Kuznikov on a balanced and well-researched story about the resignation of Northwestern University’s President Michael Schill.

Full disclosure: I am a professor in the English Department at Northwestern, and so must get out my red pen for one little word choice.

One paragraph midstory describes the unwarranted and possibly illegal cutting off of $790 million in federal funds to NU as part of the “Trump administration’s larger diatribe against higher education [... ]”

A “diatribe” is a verbal assault or attack. Synonyms: A rant, perhaps, a screed, or even a jeremiad. What the Trump administration has done, and is doing, against American higher education is a quantum leap above a mere verbal “diatribe.” It is a material assault, a cultural war, a misguided right-wing crusade.

I end my diatribe here.

Pondering Genesis Convention Center’s future

Sun-Time architecture critic Lee Bey recently wrote a column on the deteriorating Genesis Convention Center. The piece excellently highlighted Gary and the city’s architecture. Mr. Bey mentioned the success of the center in its heyday in the early 1980s. While a a number of popular entertainers and political figures appeared at the center, the revenue was never enough to maintain the large building.

Currently, Gary has a very popular and talented mayor who is working hard to rejuvenate a once great city. I believe he wants the best for Gary and the convention center building. Should the building remain, chances of it being rehabbed for convention purposes are slim to none.

Gary already has a magnificent high school, West Side Leadership Academy, that could handle any convention. The building has a 6,700-seat gymnasium. Some will remember that in 1972 former Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher held the historic National Black Political Convention at the school, then known as West Side High School. The event was a success.

Gary is now the home of a very successful Hard Rock Casino and has been awarded a contract to establish the area as a major convention center, as Mr. Bey noted. Additionally, Gary is next door to Chicago, which is recognized as a world-class convention center.

I believe Gary should consider converting the convention center into a city services complex: Consolidate operations such as police, fire, maintenance, sanitation, redevelopment, WLTH Radio, school services, etc. and then integrate some small food and business shops into the mix. I bet beauty and barber shops would love to locate in and around the complex.

What about a U.S. Steel welcoming office? The gigantic mill is only four blocks away.

I hope Mr. Bey will include some architectural suggestions for the convention center in the near future. As he so rightfully mentioned in his column, “losing the Genesis ... would be a hard loss — especially in a city that could use more wins.”

No war hero

The president said he loves “the smell of deportation in the morning” in his “Chipocalypse” post — a play on the line, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning” from Francis Ford Coppola’s critically acclaimed 1979 film “Apocalypse Now.” This is man who has NEVER served in the military, illustrated as in an Army uniform in his parody of an award-winning movie set during the Vietnam War. Maybe Donald Trump should take a look at the “Napalm Girl” photo.

Visions of grandeur of being a war hero? In your dreams, Mr. President.

Crux noted that the growth reflects many consecutive years of increasing investment in clean energy and manufacturing, especially over the past three years. There has also been increasing market diversification. Energy storage projects gained significant market share, alongside newly eligible credits from advanced manufacturing, critical minerals, clean fuels, geothermal, and other technologies. However, even as those segments of the market grew, the proportion of the market associated with standalone wind and solar dropped materially from 76% in the first half of 2024 to 43% in the first half of 2025. Unsold 2025 supply is even further tilted toward newly eligible technologies.

The report found that changing trade policy and negotiations around the One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduced uncertainty early in the year and further impacted an already-evolving tax credit market composition. That uncertainty led to tightened financial conditions in equity and debt markets in the first half of 2025.

The bill made significant changes to wind and solar credits, preserved credits for most other energy and manufacturing categories, and completely retained transferability. Since passage of the bill in early July, the Trump administration has further tightened the window for wind and solar energy companies to place their projects in service with tax regulations.

But the report found that increasing U.S. power demand and higher utility rates created supportive tailwinds for clean energy regardless of the administration's policy. Those demands are expected to continue to drive investments into energy storage, advanced manufacturing, clean fuels and other emerging sectors. Much of the increasing demand is coming from server farms used for processing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency transactions. Together, the forces pushed the market to adapt quickly, with both developers and investors showing an increasing interest in hybrid financing opportunities.

""Massive investments in energy infrastructure are being realized at the very moment the US needs more electricity and manufacturing capacity,"" said Crux CEO Alfred Johnson in a statement Monday. ""But the new policy environment is challenging, especially for developers of wind and solar. Transferability helped knit together what were once fragmented financing submarkets into a larger, more dynamic, more integrated market; this integration has opened new opportunities and different strategies across the capital stack.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/486e42a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5320x2793+0+37/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F25%2F401551c04fac9595d59db84c2dfd%2F438144528.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:02:23.838672

This is a significant change from previous assumptions made by EPA on the RFS costs.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Even before the Trump administration releases a proposal to reallocate biofuels gallons waived from the Renewable Fuel Standard, a group of federal lawmakers from oil-producing states is trying to stop it from happening.

Near the end of August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it had granted 63 full small-refinery exemptions, 77 partial exemptions and denied 28 other petitions.

EPA has since sent a proposal for review to the Office of Management and Budget to reallocate biofuels gallons lost through exemptions to other refiners, essentially requiring them to either blend more biofuels or buy renewable identification numbers, or RINs, to meet their RFS obligations.

On Tuesday, Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; and Bill Cassidy, R-La., introduced the ""Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act of 2025"" in the Senate, which would essentially not allow the EPA to reallocate RFS gallons.

Currently, the RFS statute in the Clean Air Act does not allow reallocation.

""For each calendar year, the administrator may not reallocate to other persons any renewable fuel obligation applicable to a small refinery to which an extension of an exemption applies,"" the bill that would amend the Clean Air Act states.

Ethanol industry groups have been adamant that any SREs granted by EPA should be made up with a corresponding reallocation of gallons to other obligated parties to the RFS.

""Today I'm introducing a bill to advance President Trump's growth agenda for American energy and lower costs for hardworking families,"" Lee said in a post on social platform X.

""Nowhere in the Clean Air Act does it say that the swampy corn lobby can force Americans to pay more for their products. By jamming through more biofuels and environmental compliance costs, regulators are stifling US energy producers and jacking up the price of fuel. It's bad for refineries, bad for American consumers and bad for American energy independence. That's why I'm introducing the 'Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act,' ensuring that refineries in Utah and across the nation are not subjected to unlawful regulations invented by DC lobbyists.""

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement that refiners should be following the RFS law already.

""We shouldn't even be having a conversation about reallocation,"" he said.

""Reallocating exempted volumes wouldn't even be necessary if all refiners would simply follow the law and do their fair share. Refiners of all shapes and sizes have had 20 years to figure out how to comply with the RFS and the small-refinery exemption was always meant to be a temporary bridge to compliance. This bill simply rewards the bad behavior of a handful of small refineries who have steadfastly refused to blend renewable fuels and are looking for yet another way to dodge their legal obligation to deliver lower-cost, cleaner fuels to American drivers.""

In an announcement on more than 180 pending petitions for small-refinery exemptions on Aug. 22, 2025, EPA said it did not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes from 2016 to 2022.

""EPA will also be providing updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years,"" the agency said in a news release last month.

""The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation's fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today's actions and projected SREs granted for 2025-2027 in Set 2.""

According to the 31-page document released by the EPA on the decision, the granted full and partial exemptions account for 5.34 billion Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs. What's more, the agency said it has moved away from presuming all refineries can fully pass RIN costs to consumers and acknowledged some refineries may face higher RFS compliance costs.

This is a significant change from previous assumptions made by EPA on the RFS costs.

In addition, EPA said it was reaffirming a policy to return RINs previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year.

Under the RFS program, RINs have a two-year window for use, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the following compliance year.

Nevertheless, battery storage could help grids around the world to avoid Iberian-style chaos.
Flow batteries rely on the ability of some metals to exist stably with different numbers of electrons.
An important benefit of the flow battery is that it is much simpler to manufacture than lithium ion equivalents.
Invinity is valued at just over £90m on London’s Aim junior stock market, and it is hoping the UK takes a lead in the flow battery niche.","Think of battery manufacturing and it may evoke images of Elon Musk and Tesla’s sprawling “gigafactories” around the globe, or China’s vast, hi-tech clean rooms churning out cells to go in anything from electric toothbrushes to mobile phones and cars. But at Invinity Energy Systems’s small factory in Bathgate, near Edinburgh, workers slotting parts together are hoping that Britain can also play a part in the battery revolution.

These batteries, which rely on vanadium ions, are put in 6-metre (20ft), 25-tonne shipping containers. They will not go into cars, but the manufacturer hopes the technology can win a place in a global rush into storage to usher in the shift to net zero carbon grids.

Renewable electricity is the future of the global energy system: cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuels. However, its main drawback is that renewables generation is tied to the weather, and the sun may not be shining or the wind blowing at the times when energy is most needed. “Time shifting” that energy generation with battery storage, so it can be stored and used later, will be crucial to the proper functioning of electricity grids.

“What suddenly started to happen is that people have woken up to realise that energy storage is needed to be able to deploy more renewables on to the grid,” said Jonathan Marren, the Invinity chief executive, at the factory where a row of the batteries is stacked, ready to be shipped.

Experts have long been grappling with the different options for storing renewable power, but the issue of the reliability of grids rose up the political agenda in April when Spain and Portugal suffered the biggest blackout in Europe in 20 years. Some people rushed to blame renewable energy, although a Spanish government report said that was not the case. Nevertheless, battery storage could help grids around the world to avoid Iberian-style chaos.

Much of the focus on battery research has been on cramming as much energy as possible into the smallest, lightest container to go into electric cars. That work has been crucial for the switch away from the carbon pollution from petrol and diesel, a key contributor to global heating. It has also forced down the cost of lithium ion batteries dramatically.

As with much of the transition away from fossil fuels to electric technology, it is China that is driving an increase in demand at an astonishing scale. China has installed batteries with a capacity of 215 gigawatt hours (GWh) – two-thirds of the global total – according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a data company.

China’s battery installations are due to nearly quadruple by the end of 2027 to 826GWh, if all planned projects are completed. For instance, the state-owned China Energy Engineering Corporation last month tendered for 25GWh of batteries using lithium iron phosphate technology that is being used in cheaper cars.

Iola Hughes, the head of research at Rho Motion, a Benchmark subsidiary, said falling prices and the growth of renewable energy were driving the rise in demand. By 2027 total global battery storage installations could increase by five times to 1,500GWh, said Hughes, and “this figure could increase even further as advancements in technology and declining costs allow developers to build battery energy storage systems at a faster pace than historically”.

The vast majority of that rise – 95% on current numbers – will be projects using lithium ion batteries such as those being used in Aberdeenshire by Britain’s Zenobē Energy, which installed batteries with a capacity of 600MWh – enough to power all the homes in Scotland for an hour. They claim the site is “Europe’s largest battery”.

Energy storage companies using different technologies must now run the brutal gauntlet of finding early stage funding as they try to prove that their technology will be economical. Invinity’s flow batteries use vanadium, while in the US its rival Eos Energy is using zinc. However, flow batteries could find a niche for storage over six to eight hours – more than the two or so hours that lithium batteries tend to provide.

Flow batteries rely on the ability of some metals to exist stably with different numbers of electrons. One shipping container holds two tanks containing vanadium ions with different numbers of electrons – one “royal purple”, the other “Irn-Bru red”. A pump moves the vanadium liquid through a stack of membranes that allow protons to cross, while the electrons are diverted around a circuit, providing power. If electrons are forced in the other direction – by a solar panel or a wind turbine – the reaction moves in reverse, recharging the battery, which can hold 300 kilowatt hours of charge.

An important benefit of the flow battery is that it is much simpler to manufacture than lithium ion equivalents. Invinity has been able to make its stacks with 90 employees, mostly based in a part of Scotland that has deindustrialised.

Marren claimed that over the project lifetime “on a levelised cost basis, we are better value than lithium”. The upfront cost is still higher than lithium batteries – Invinity hints that it costs above £100,000 for a container – but the batteries last much longer without losing capacity, and are non-flammable, so do not need expensive fire safety equipment. The shipping containers are already sitting beside wave machines in Bristol, car chargers in Oxford, a casino in California and a solar park in South Australia.

“We can commission whole sites within days,” Marren said.

Invinity is valued at just over £90m on London’s Aim junior stock market, and it is hoping the UK takes a lead in the flow battery niche.

British manufacturing could count in its favour in a government competition for support under a “cap and floor” scheme that will guarantee electricity prices within a set range – removing the risk from a sustained fall in prices. If successful, the company would require a big production expansion from the current ability to make five containers a week, Marren said. He dreams of employing 1,000 workers if the company takes off.

“The potential for expansion is enormous,” Marren said. “We’ve gone past the stage of ‘does the tech work at scale’? We’ve got a long-duration storage that works.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f51f715b9eb8dd021a3117c2688a9b606cf322/928_1792_4584_3666/master/4584.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea21d72e8726340beebcde60a750d0a4",N,,2025-09-09 16:02:26.977054

Pilot now has electric vehicle fast-charging at more than 200 locations across the country

“Pilot is here to fuel the journeys of all drivers. Our fast-charging network raises the bar for convenience, reliability and exceptional service by offering an experience designed to show EV drivers that they matter,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot. “Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel.”

Expanding this network from 25+ states to nearly 40 in under a year, the companies continue to add charging availability across our nation’s countryside, where only 45% of rural counties had at least one fast charging stall available at the start of 2025.1 Some of the newest states to join this growing network include Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, with significant expansion across Texas, Missouri and Florida.

“Hitting the open road is a natural emblem of American culture, and traveling by car means drivers can set their own schedule to stop and charge when and where they want,” said Badar Khan, CEO of EVgo. “Our EVgo eXtend network, built in collaboration with Pilot and GM, is delivering reliable charging to communities large and small — ensuring freedom of fueling choice for every driver.”

The collaboration between Pilot, GM and EVgo is bringing public fast charging to the country’s interstate travel corridors that carry more than 20 percent of the total traffic in America.2 Pilot and Flying J locations epitomize convenience by combining charging options with an array of amenities, including free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurants, and grocery and convenience items—and EVgo’s 350kW fast-chargers can quickly refill range and get drivers back on the road.

Overhead canopies at many locations protect drivers from sun or snow and pull-through stalls allow drivers who are towing a trailer or traveling in an electric van to easily connect their charging ports. Plug and Charge – a feature that enables compatible EV models to automatically initiate and pay for a charging session simply by plugging in – is available throughout the network for drivers with compatible EV models, making it even easier to power up on the go.

“With over a dozen electric vehicles across Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac, GM is giving customers the right vehicle to take them wherever they want to go: from highway driving to off-road trails,” said Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy. “Through our collaboration with Pilot and EVgo, we’re committed to helping ensure that charging access doesn’t get in the way of your EV journey.”

Pilot, GM, and EVgo first announced their collaboration in 2022 and are now nearly halfway toward their goal of building a total of up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J locations across the U.S. By the end of 2025, the companies anticipate reaching 1,000 stalls across 40 states.

Tobe’s breakthrough technology achieves 94.7% efficiency, reduces operating costs by 50+% and enables domestic manufacturing with readily available U.S. stainless steel, the company says, setting the stage for scalable, affordable and sustainable decarbonization across heavy industry and emerging sectors like AI-powered data centers.

Additional investors in the round include 46 VC, through its Scissortail and Hurricane funds, Techstars, marking one of the accelerator’s largest follow-on investments to date, Wavefunction VC, a deep tech fund led by former SpaceX engineer and repeat deep tech founder Jamie Gull, and a select group of seasoned angel investors. Together with Cortado Ventures, this coalition brings a powerful combination of capital, industry expertise and strategic relationships to help Tobe Energy scale its technology and accelerate market adoption.

Additionally, Tobe Energy has signed a memorandum of understanding with Zeeco to collaborate on its first hydrogen production pilot plant at Zeeco’s Advanced Research Complex in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.

Tobe Energy CEO and founder Colby DeWeese, a chemical engineer and natural gas project manager turned clean energy entrepreneur, built Tobe Energy on a legacy of innovation. He founded the company after pioneering a new electrolysis process—a leap in efficiency akin to moving from incandescent bulbs to LEDs.

DeWeese grew up prototyping electronics with his late father, the inventor of the TiVo, before graduating from the University of Tulsa and beginning his career in oil and gas. He managed $75M+ projects across the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors, honing a knack for solving technical problems under pressure and delivering systems that perform in the real world. Disillusioned by systemic inefficiencies in traditional energy systems, DeWeese pivoted to renewables—first hydrogen combustion, then green hydrogen production—and has since devoted his career to clean-tech solutions that work in demanding industrial settings. Before launching Tobe, DeWeese served as principal process engineer at Hydrogen Technologies, where he led the design and delivery of the first zero-emission hydrogen boiler of its kind.

“My dad taught me early on how to build things that solve real problems—and that mindset never left me,” DeWeese said. “With this technology, we’ve reimagined the internal workings of electrolysis to dramatically reduce waste heat and cost. And we’ve done it with American-made materials and a prototype that’s already running strong. It’s not just about innovation—it’s about building a more secure, scalable path to decarbonization.”

Tobe’s system operates at a roughly 75% reduction of capital costs compared to conventional electrolyzers. The company’s zero-emission hydrogen prototype has already logged 1,000 hours of runtime, with applications ranging from steel manufacturing and fertilizer production to long-term e-fuels development. Using its hydrogen in combination with atmospheric carbon dioxide, Tobe can create synthetic natural gas alternatives that are both emissions-free and, with federal tax credits, projected to be cheaper than fossil fuels.

The technology also shows promise in next-gen energy storage — especially for AI data centers. By generating hydrogen during off-peak periods and converting it back to power, Tobe’s systems offer an ultra-efficient, zero-emission alternative to lithium-ion battery banks.

“Tobe’s technology represents a category-defining leap in clean energy,” said Caleb Lareau, a Harvard Ph.D. and co-founder of Tobe Energy. “It’s rare to see a system that delivers both high efficiency and economic viability at this scale. We’re opening the door to hydrogen’s real potential—not just for fuel, but as the backbone of 21st-century energy storage.”",https://journalrecord.com/files/2025/09/09-10-CortadoPage-2.png,N,,2025-09-09 16:03:37.070534

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices have been shown to both increase soil organic carbon (SOC) inputs and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGnet).","RALEIGH, N.C. — A study using multiple agronomic models to examine two long-term agricultural research stations in North America shows that so-called climate-smart agricultural practices – like no-till treatments, cover-crop utilization and residue retention – can help promote carbon sequestration in soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The findings show that using a combination of models – rather than just one – can provide a more realistic range of outcomes and can highlight the shortcomings of individual models.

“We targeted open-source data from long-term agricultural experiments in Michigan and Texas that are very different – with different climates, soils and crops grown,” said Debjani Sihi, the senior author of a paper describing the research and a member of NC State’s Plant Sciences Initiative. “By utilizing these long-term studies, we wanted to see what the future might look like in terms of carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions.

“We examined three different models developed by different research groups and looked at them collectively,” said Sihi, an assistant professor with joint appointments in NC State’s Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and Department of Crop and Soil Sciences. “The architecture is a little different in these models. What can we learn from each of the models, and what is the collective information?”

The study examined data from more than three decades at the two agricultural experimental sites and calibrated it into a “model ensemble” to make future predictions. The ensemble examined both individual climate-smart agricultural practices and practices that were “stacked,” or added to each other.

The researchers then examined whether these proposed practices would, in the next 25 years or so, generate carbon sequestration in soil and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in two different scenarios: a baseline scenario that replicated climate-change historical data of the past three decades, and a “worst-case” scenario that envisions dramatic growth in greenhouse gas emissions.

“We tried to capture a variety of biological processes related to soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) emission while also accounting for climate-change effects,” Sihi said. “These processes are driven by different climate variables like temperature and precipitation.”

The model ensemble showed some positive effects in both studied locations under the baseline scenario.

“At the Michigan site, we found that no-till farming and keeping crop residues on the field increased soil carbon sequestration, while using no-till farming, some cover crops, and reducing fertilizer decreased greenhouse gas emissions,” Sihi said. “At the Texas site, most of the farming practices we tried increased soil carbon sequestration, and greenhouse gas emissions stayed about the same. However, the models indicated that not plowing alone could reverse greenhouse gas emissions.”

The worst-case scenario, however, lived up to its name in the study.

“We also found that all the climate-smart farming practices performed worse under worst-case scenario climate change, which was expected,” Sihi said.

She added that the study could provide the impetus for other researchers to try out the model ensemble approach and improve it. Future studies could be improved by using real-world data from on-farm studies and selecting other models with different strengths to broaden the insights.

“We hope others will evaluate these climate-smart practices to learn which may be more important, and what kind of experiments that we can leverage,” Sihi said. “These are two long-term examples in Michigan and Texas that we have utilized, so that others could adopt and improve and build on it.

“In this context, utilizing no-till or cover crops as a base practice and then stacking residue retention reduced future net emissions. Future work would need more study in other parts of the country – or world – to better generalize effects.”

Abstract: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction efforts are underway to mitigate climate change worldwide. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices have been shown to both increase soil organic carbon (SOC) inputs and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions (GHGnet). We evaluated the GHGnet of several management practices with three biogeochemical models (APSIM, Daycent, and RothC) at two sites with contrasting soils, climates, and cropping systems. Additionally, two future climate scenarios (baseline and high-emissions) provided alternative outcomes of SOC, N2O, and CH4 by 2050. In Michigan, most biochar and residue retention with no-till treatments increased SOC stocks; leguminous cover crops, no-till, and reducing fertilizer input lowered N2O emissions. The lowest biochar treatment lowered GHGnet in the baseline climate scenario, but all other management treatments increased GHGnet under both baseline and high emissions, and all management scenarios increased a mean of 8.0 Mg CO2-equivalent GHG (CO2e) ha?1 from baseline to high emissions. Conversely, in Texas, most treatments increased SOC, and N2O was relatively constant. Every no-till treatment reversed GHGnet in both the baseline and high-emissions climate scenarios but all management scenarios increased a mean of 0.6 Mg CO2e ha?1 under high emissions. At both sites under high-emissions climate change, cover crops and no-till resulted in the lowest GHGnet overall. Overall, the study showed that no-till, especially with residue retention, and cover crops are important CSA practices to lower the GHGnet of agriculture, but there remains much room to find even more effective solutions to adapt to climate change.

These three companies have partnered with the purpose of giving EV drivers access to essential services and have collectively opened more than 200 locations in almost 40 states. These 850 fast charging stalls distributed across the partnered stations have greatly improved regional driving freedom and mobility across the United States, alongside the 24/7 open access to fast charging at Pilot and Flying J travel centers.

The once complex planning for long road trips that electric vehicle owners had to deal with is now a lot less stressful due to the growing network of fast-charging stations available. With these charging stations in place, the travel options for electric vehicles across the U.S. become a lot more convenient.

Increasing Charging Networks for EV Drivers

Aside from adding the fast charging stations, EV prowess is restricted because they don’t have the in-app roaming options they need. Thanks to Pilot, GM, and EVgo, long-distance trips can now be taken without worrying about charging habits. Together, they sponsor and allow EVgo to justify and address the charging hierarchy.

Currently, EVgo covers about 25 states and, in under 6 months, managed to include an additional 15. EVgo is now located in the newly launched states, which include South Carolina, Louisiana, Wyoming, and Colorado. There is augmented support from South Dakota and North Dakota. Already saturated areas like Texas, Missouri, and Florida have also increased sponsorship levels. This is a boon to regions where there is a servitude to population, like the 45% of people who were earlier underserved. It helps ease access to charging infrastructure for fast EVs.

Customer-Focused and Convenient Features at Charging Stations

Key to this fast-charging expansion is the dedication to providing convenience for EV drivers. The stations are located at the Pilot and Flying J travel centers, which are already known to offer free Wi-Fi, restaurants, and groceries. By fast-charging and adding other amenities, the stations offer a remarkable experience to EV users on the move.

The 350kW EVgo fast-chargers located at the stations offer swift charging, helping drivers to get back on the road in no time. These chargers focus on EVgo’s hyper-network, catering to the electrified mobility ecosystem, enabling EVs on the road to experience reduced downtime and efficient travel. Additionally, a number of stations have EV charging access meters and their own canopies to help protect users from the elements.

Plug and Charge: Exceptional Driver Experience

Along with various other refinements, certain charging stations use the “Plug and Charge” method that allows seamless charging of the vehicles. With “Plug and Charge” technology, folks with electric vehicles can enjoy the convenience that comes with not having to complete a range of activities like using a complimentary app or swiping a card. Charging will begin with a click of a button, and the terminals will take care of all the payments.

Though simplistic in nature, this strategy attempts to address a bigger and more critical purpose: the relief of range anxiety. The function aims to make storing electricity in a vehicle and thus using it for powering the vehicle a hassle-free process. This is the reason recharging will soon be as easy as refueling a gasoline-operated vehicle.

Supporting America’s Road Culture with EV-Friendly Solutions

For GM, the collaboration with Pilot and EVgo is central to its strategy of nurturing an all-electric future. GM is eager to confirm that its customers with more than a dozen electric vehicles dispersed among Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac can roam worry-free without the concern of charging gaps. The company has been clear that the electrification of vehicles is more than the production of vehicles— GM is willing to help foster the construction of a sturdy charging infrastructure, enabling EV owners to travel without apprehension about long-distance travel and reliable fast-charging stations.

The Road Ahead: Achieving Charging Goals and Future Developments

The trio has been working towards a target of deploying 2000 fast charging stalls within 500 locations by the end of 2025, since the partnership began in 2022. Their mission to construct affordable and dependable charging infrastructure for EV owners across the country advances with every goal reached. Charging stall target 1,000 is the aim by the end of the calendar year.

Growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs) prompted Pilot, GM, and EVgo to work in unison so that EV drivers in America can learn to traverse from one coast to the other without worrying about charging. This is a particular case of how the private sector, in collaboration with the government and other businesses, can contribute toward a more connected and sustainable future for all travelers.

Conclusion

The expanding network of charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) at Pilot and Flying J facilities is a sign of the transition toward electric mobility in the United States. This should ease the apprehensions of passengers and other urban commuters with regular vehicles about the reliability of charging stations. The collaborative network of Pilot, GM, and EVgo is expanding, bringing with it the promise of easier EV access to more drivers. Rechargeable EVs are gaining in prominence, and this is due to improved investments in charging infrastructure in America. Apart from ease of access, there is a promise of improved infrastructure and investments for all drivers in the U.S.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Expanding-EV-Charging-Network-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:04:00.340760

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” Zeldin said.
For Arizona, where the technology, manufacturing, and clean energy sectors are rapidly expanding, the new guidance could prove especially significant.
Just weeks later, during a visit to Arizona, Zeldin rescinded prior federal guidance that local business leaders said jeopardized economic development in the state.
That reversal, which was welcomed by the Arizona Chamber, underscored the EPA’s willingness to adjust policies in response to concerns from the business community.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced new guidance on Tuesday to provide greater clarity and reduce delays in the permitting process for major energy, data center, and manufacturing projects.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin outlined updates to the agency’s New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting requirements, allowing certain building activities that do not directly relate to air emissions to move forward before a Clean Air Act permit is finalized.

The move is part of the Trump administration’s effort to accelerate infrastructure development and position the United States as a global leader in advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence (AI).

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” Zeldin said. “We are continuing to fix this broken system. Today’s guidance is another step to allow the build out of essential power generation, data centers, and manufacturing projects that will bring about America’s Golden Age.”

The EPA also intends to launch a formal rulemaking to update the definition of “Begin Actual Construction” within NSR regulations. The goal is to make it easier for developers and permitting authorities to distinguish between emissions-related and non-emissions-related construction activities, helping to streamline timelines without compromising environmental safeguards.

The business community responds

Business leaders have long argued that federal permitting delays create unnecessary costs and uncertainty for companies seeking to invest in new facilities. For Arizona, where the technology, manufacturing, and clean energy sectors are rapidly expanding, the new guidance could prove especially significant.

“Arizona businesses depend on a clear and predictable regulatory environment to invest, expand, and hire. The EPA’s action will help unlock the construction of the energy infrastructure, data centers, and advanced manufacturing facilities our economy needs to compete in the global marketplace,” Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry President and CEO Danny Seiden said. “By streamlining permitting without compromising environmental safeguards, this guidance strikes the right balance between growth and responsibility, and it sends a strong signal that the U.S. is serious about becoming the world leader in innovation.”

Arizona Chamber working with EPA to advance pro-business, pro-environment policy

The announcement builds on an ongoing dialogue between the EPA and Arizona business leaders.

In March, Administrator Zeldin joined Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) in a discussion on the economic implications of federal regulations for Arizona industries, emphasizing the importance of balanced policies that protect both jobs and the environment.

Looking Ahead By December 2025, the US plans to add one thousand charging stations in forty states, boosting eco-friendly travel options nationwide.","The US is on fast forward when it comes to making travel smoother for everyone by boosting its electric vehicle (EV) support. The latest upgrade includes more than two hundred shiny new fast-charging stations that are now open for business in almost forty states. These stations reduce the hassle for electric vehicle drivers on cross-country adventures and tie our highways together in the process. With chargers popping up along major routes, the nation is building an easy-to-reach map for anyone wanting to take an eco-friendly road trip. This effort is more than convenience; it’s a clear move to cut carbon footprints, support green travel, and turn our car journeys into modern, efficient adventures that leave a lighter mark on the planet. Whether you’re a US resident or a visitor from abroad, the open road is now officially the smart road.

Nationwide Expansion of EV Charging

In just two years, nearly eight hundred fifty new fast charging stalls have been deployed along major interstate routes. These charging points cover critical travel corridors that account for more than twenty percent of the country’s total traffic. This expansion ensures visitors can journey coast-to-coast with reliable access to energy while exploring popular destinations and hidden gems alike.

Supporting Rural and Scenic Travel

Tourism in rural America is set to benefit significantly from this network. At the beginning of 2025, only forty five percent of rural counties had at least one fast charging stall. Now, many states with strong tourism appeal including Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming are part of the growing network. Travellers can now access charging options while exploring mountains, historic towns, national parks, and cultural attractions across these regions.

Enhancing the Road Trip Experience

Long considered a symbol of American travel, the road trip is being revitalised through sustainable infrastructure. The inclusion of new charging hubs across Texas, Missouri, and Florida is particularly notable, as these states attract millions of domestic and international visitors each year. Tourists travelling by car or electric camper van now have greater freedom to plan routes that combine major cities, countryside, and coastal landscapes without being limited by charging availability.

Improved Travel Facilities

The new charging stations are strategically placed at interstate travel centres, combining convenience with essential amenities. Many of these hubs offer sheltered charging bays, easy access for vehicles towing trailers, and additional facilities such as Wi-Fi, dining options, and grocery supplies. This infrastructure not only supports the practical needs of drivers but also creates welcoming rest points that enhance the overall tourism experience.

Sustainable Tourism Growth

The expansion of EV charging supports the nation’s broader sustainability goals while encouraging eco-friendly travel practices. With tourism forming a vital part of the United States economy, the availability of reliable charging options aligns with growing demand from travellers seeking low-carbon journeys. The initiative also strengthens accessibility for diverse vehicle types, ensuring that eco-conscious visitors can explore national parks, cultural landmarks, and rural trails without disruption.

Looking Ahead

By December 2025, the US plans to add one thousand charging stations in forty states, boosting eco-friendly travel options nationwide. This growth helps carry US tourism toward a greener future and keeps the country a top choice for visitors from around the world. Having enough charging points is a key part of making America a comfortable, appealing destination as it moves to cleaner energy.

With these new charging spots, tourists can tour the country’s stunning parks, lively downtowns, and famous roads without worrying about their electric vehicles. They can travel confidently while playing a part in protecting the environment, making every road trip a step toward a sustainable tomorrow.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US-14.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:04:29.951554

Consumers and Hull Street Energy, LLC, on Tuesday announced they had signed a purchase agreement. In a release, Hull Street said it has created a subsidiary named Confluence Hydro to manage the 13 dams, as well as others purchased by Hull Street in the future.

The purchase agreement calls for Confluence Hydro to enter into a contract with Consumers to provide power from the dams for 30 years, the release said. According to Consumers’ website, the reservoirs will be preserved.

Confluence Hydro intends to upgrade and modernize the dams, which Consumers has said need maintenance and capital investment.

“We believe a sale of the dams is the best path forward for our customers,” said Sri Maddipati, Consumers Energy’s president of electric supply, in a statement. “This sale balances two important needs, to lower costs for Consumers Energy’s customers while continuing to care for communities that depend on the dams.”

The dams, located across Michigan, include several in West Michigan: Croton Dam, Hardy Dam and Rogers Dam on the Muskegon River; Calkins Bridge Dam on the Kalamazoo River; and Hodenpyl Dam and Tippy Dam on the Manistee River. Federal operating licenses for the dam start to expire in 2034, so Confluence Hydro plans to seek approval to renew them, it said.

“With decades of experience operating hydro facilities, we are committed to preserving and modernizing these important resources to maximize their contribution to the grid,” stated Confluence Hydro CEO Ed Quinn.

State and federal regulators will need to approve the sale, which is expected to be finalized in 12 to 18 months. According to the release, Confluence Hydro intends to offer equivalent positions to current Consumers Energy hydro employees.

However, the Permit also creates a “shield” from liability that treats compliance with the permit's terms as compliance with applicable Clean Air Act requirements.
It held that the reasoning of Sierra Club does not support EPA’s contention that the Title V affirmative defense is unlawful.
The Court held that: …EPA rescinded a thirty-year-old affirmative defense on the ground that it was unlawful under the Clean Air Act.
EPA's reasoning, however, cannot be squared with the text of the Clean Air Act or our precedents.","The United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit (“Court”) addressed in a September 5th Opinion the validity of the Clean Air Act Startup/Shutdown/Malfunction (“SSM”) affirmative defense. See SSM Litigation Group v. Environmental Protection Agency, 2025 WL 2552531.

The SSM Litigation Group (“SSM”) argued that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) recission of the Clean Air Act Title V affirmative defense was arbitrary and capricious because it rests on erroneous legal justifications.

The Court agrees and grants the petition.

SSM provisions might generally be described as follows:

Startup constitutes setting in operation an effective source or a portion of an effective source.

Shutdown generally connotates the cessation of operation of an effective source of portion of an effective source.

Malfunction is generally described as any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of an air pollution control and monitoring requirement, process equipment, or process to operate in a normal and unusual manner which causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in the applicable standard to be exceeded (i.e., it does not constitute scheduled maintenance).

The role of SSM exemptions has been a focus of EPA, states, the regulated community, and environmental organizations for many years. Various existing state air rules had historically allowed some excess emissions during SSM events if certain procedural requirements were met.

Certain operators of stationary sources of air pollution are required to apply for and hold a Clean Air Act Title V Permit which must list the enforceable emission limitations and standards applicable to the source under the Clean Air Act. If an operator violates the emission limitations and standards incorporated in its Permit, the operator can be sued for injunctive relief and any appropriate civil penalties. However, the Permit also creates a “shield” from liability that treats compliance with the permit's terms as compliance with applicable Clean Air Act requirements.

EPA is noted to have promulgated after enactment of Title V regulations a provision that created a defense for stationary sources that exceed their emission limitations due to an emergency event. See 57 Fed. Reg. 32250, 32306 (1992).

The Title V affirmative defense is stated to have been retained by EPA for many years until it proposed rescinding it on the ground that it unlawfully encroached on the Judiciary’s role to impose “any appropriate civil penalties” for Clean Air Act violations.

EPA had concluded that the defense was unlawful because it operated as an exemption from otherwise applicable emission limitations. Therefore, it was argued by EPA to render those limitations non-continuous in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 7602(k). The SSM defense was rescinded by EPA in 2023.

SSM therefore petitioned for a review of this action.

The Court concludes that EPA’s rescission was not reasonably explained and not in accordance with the law. It concluded that because the Title V affirmative defense is a complete defense to liability as opposed to a limitation on judicial remedies, EPA’s primary rationale for its rescission was erroneous.

The Court also rejected EPA and environmental intervenors’ argument that the Title V affirmative defense is effectively an exemption from applicable emission limitations and therefore renders those

limitations not “continuous” in violation of the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by this court in Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d at 1027–28. It held that the reasoning of Sierra Club does not support EPA’s contention that the Title V affirmative defense is unlawful.

The Court holds that a complete affirmative defense to liability does not render an emission limitation non-continuous under the cited statutory provision.

The Court held that:

…EPA rescinded a thirty-year-old affirmative defense on the ground that it was unlawful under the Clean Air Act. EPA's reasoning, however, cannot be squared with the text of the Clean Air Act or our precedents. Because EPA offered no independent policy rationale, its rescission regulation was unreasonable and not in accordance with law. We therefore grant the petition and reverse the rescission.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:03:32.302522

Senator Mike Lee of Utah is leading the so-called Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act of 2025 bill, which the Senators plan to introduce on Tuesday amid a hotly contested issue between America’s Farm Belt and oil industry—both Republican darlings but with opposite interests in the U.S. biofuels policy.

The so-called Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is the U.S. policy under which oil refiners are required to blend growing amounts of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel. It sets the number of gallons of renewable fuels that must be blended into the nation’s total fuel supply each year.

Under the RFS program, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may grant a temporary exemption to a small refinery from the annual Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) if the refinery can demonstrate that compliance with the RVOs would cause the refinery to suffer disproportionate economic hardship.

Last month, EPA granted many exemptions to small refiners after processing a backlog of 175 petitions for exemptions since 2016. EPA also said it would submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the proposed reallocations of the exempted volumes for 2023 and 2024.

This reallocation is now the issue with the larger refiners and the Senators from the refinery states who see the reallocation of the blending obligations as a burden for consumers.

“Punishing American energy producers who comply with the EPA’s made-up rules isn’t just unfair, it’s bad for everyday consumers. Americans will pay more at the pump and Utah’s refineries will suffer,” Senator Lee said in a statement carried by Reuters.

Other Republican Senators, including John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, are also sponsors of the bill.

The issue is dividing Republicans as the oil companies and ethanol producers in their respective states are on two opposing sides.

After EPA’s waivers last month, Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, said “It is imperative that EPA reallocates each and every exempt gallon in a forthcoming rule to mitigate the potentially devastating impact on biofuel demand.”

However, the refiners’ association, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), firmly opposes the reallocation of the biofuel volumes to the bigger refiners.

“Piling on more than a billion gallons in additional, reallocated mandates will do nothing other than increase imports, harm U.S. energy dominance and cost consumers,” AFPM President and CEO Chet Thompson said.

“This is akin to your neighbor getting a tax break and the IRS showing up at your doorstep with the bill. It is simply wrong.”

Lennon, Christopher Shea, Nancy Lavin",,,,,https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/09/09/loss-of-revolution-wind-could-cost-ratepayers-500m-a-year-conn-officials-say/,"Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.
Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
“However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said.","Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said.

Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.

The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.

Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.

While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.

“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”

According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.

In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.

Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.

Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.

The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.

In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.

But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.

Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.

“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”

In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.

While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.

“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.

Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.

In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.

One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.

“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”

In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.

Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.

However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.

“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Johns Hopkins research backs up estimate

Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.

Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)

“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”

Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.

Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.

Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.

Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.

A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.

Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.

“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.

At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.

State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.

Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.

“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”

Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.

While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.

“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”

Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.

“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-107-2000x1333-1.webp,N,,2025-09-09 14:03:05.503937

EPA's reasoning, however, cannot be squared with the text of the Clean Air Act or our precedents.","The United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit (“Court”) addressed in a September 5th Opinion the validity of the Clean Air Act Startup/Shutdown/Malfunction (“SSM”) affirmative defense. See SSM Litigation Group v. Environmental Protection Agency, 2025 WL 2552531.

The SSM Litigation Group (“SSM”) argued that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) recission of the Clean Air Act Title V affirmative defense was arbitrary and capricious because it rests on erroneous legal justifications.

The Court agrees and grants the petition.

SSM provisions might generally be described as follows:

Startup constitutes setting in operation an effective source or a portion of an effective source.

Shutdown generally connotates the cessation of operation of an effective source of portion of an effective source.

Malfunction is generally described as any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of an air pollution control and monitoring requirement, process equipment, or process to operate in a normal and unusual manner which causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in the applicable standard to be exceeded (i.e., it does not constitute scheduled maintenance).

The role of SSM exemptions has been a focus of EPA, states, the regulated community, and environmental organizations for many years. Various existing state air rules had historically allowed some excess emissions during SSM events if certain procedural requirements were met.

Certain operators of stationary sources of air pollution are required to apply for and hold a Clean Air Act Title V Permit which must list the enforceable emission limitations and standards applicable to the source under the Clean Air Act. If an operator violates the emission limitations and standards incorporated in its Permit, the operator can be sued for injunctive relief and any appropriate civil penalties. However, the Permit also creates a “shield” from liability that treats compliance with the permit's terms as compliance with applicable Clean Air Act requirements.

EPA is noted to have promulgated after enactment of Title V regulations a provision that created a defense for stationary sources that exceed their emission limitations due to an emergency event. See 57 Fed. Reg. 32250, 32306 (1992).

The Title V affirmative defense is stated to have been retained by EPA for many years until it proposed rescinding it on the ground that it unlawfully encroached on the Judiciary’s role to impose “any appropriate civil penalties” for Clean Air Act violations.

EPA had concluded that the defense was unlawful because it operated as an exemption from otherwise applicable emission limitations. Therefore, it was argued by EPA to render those limitations non-continuous in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 7602(k). The SSM defense was rescinded by EPA in 2023.

SSM therefore petitioned for a review of this action.

The Court concludes that EPA’s rescission was not reasonably explained and not in accordance with the law. It concluded that because the Title V affirmative defense is a complete defense to liability as opposed to a limitation on judicial remedies, EPA’s primary rationale for its rescission was erroneous.

The Court also rejected EPA and environmental intervenors’ argument that the Title V affirmative defense is effectively an exemption from applicable emission limitations and therefore renders those

limitations not “continuous” in violation of the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by this court in Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d at 1027–28. It held that the reasoning of Sierra Club does not support EPA’s contention that the Title V affirmative defense is unlawful.

The Court holds that a complete affirmative defense to liability does not render an emission limitation non-continuous under the cited statutory provision.

The Court held that:

…EPA rescinded a thirty-year-old affirmative defense on the ground that it was unlawful under the Clean Air Act. EPA's reasoning, however, cannot be squared with the text of the Clean Air Act or our precedents. Because EPA offered no independent policy rationale, its rescission regulation was unreasonable and not in accordance with law. We therefore grant the petition and reverse the rescission.",https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/images/site/Social_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 18:04:56.688549

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and U.S. Representative Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, sent a letter to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright expressing serious concerns surrounding the DOE’s cancellation of two dozen clean energy projects. The cancellation of these projects comes as energy demand continues to grow and consumer electricity bills surge as a result of the Trump Administration’s attacks on clean energy across the country.

“We write to express serious concerns with the cancellation of 24 projects that were supported through statutorily mandated programs overseen by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), as well as the process by which these cancellations were carried out,” wrote the lawmakers. “We are concerned that the cancellation process undertaken by the Department was haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven, and we are disturbed that the Department intends to continue to use this same fatally flawed and politicized process to terminate more awards in the near future.”

Focusing on DOE’s announcement to cancel project awards, the lawmakers highlighted, “on May 30 and with cursory explanation, the Department announced the termination of 24 projects totaling $3.7 billion. The Department’s decision to terminate these projects runs afoul of the law.”

“These programs are not optional,” wrote the lawmakers. “These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress.

It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards.”

The lawmakers noted DOE’s cancellation of the projects warranted further investigation , “In order to maintain the integrity of the Department’s merit-based review processes, political appointees have not historically participated in evaluating project applications. Such a capricious departure from independent, merit-based agency procedure warrants investigation.”

The letter concluded with the Ranking Members of the committees requesting answers to several questions outlining the process the Department used to cancel the loans that OCED designated and requesting related materials.

Read the full letter here and below:

Dear Secretary Wright:

We write to express serious concerns with the cancellation of 24 projects that were supported through statutorily mandated programs overseen by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), as well as the process by which these cancellations were carried out. We are concerned that the cancellation process undertaken by DOE was haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven, and we are disturbed that the Department intends to continue to use this same fatally flawed and politicized process to terminate more awards in the near future. Troublingly, the Department cancelled projects that would re-shore domestic manufacturing, increase domestic critical material production, and spur industrial innovations. We demand that you cease the cancellation process and restore respect for independent, merit-based reviews.

On May 15, DOE announced that it was “reviewing” 179 projects that it claimed totaled $15 billion worth of investments. Later that month, on May 30 and with cursory explanation, the Department announced the termination of 24 projects totaling $3.7 billion. DOE’s decision to terminate these projects runs afoul of the law.

These programs are not optional. In fact, 18 of the cancelled projects were associated with the Industrial Decarbonization Program authorized by the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act (IIJA) in Section 41008, Industrial Emissions Demonstration Projects, and Section 50161, Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. One award was made pursuant to the IIJA Section 40342, the Clean Energy on Former and Current Mine Lands (CEML) program, and five awards were made pursuant to IIJA Section 41004, Carbon Capture Demonstration and Pilots (authorized in the Energy Act of 2020 and funded under IIJA). These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress. You have no legal authority to sabotage them; indeed, you possess a constitutional obligation to ensure that they are “faithfully executed.”

In order to better understand DOE’s justification for terminating these projects, committee staff from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce received a video briefing from the Department on June 17. The information provided by the Department to our staff was deeply concerning. On this call, DOE detailed the process – or lack thereof – by which these 24 projects were terminated. DOE acknowledged that its review process was run by political appointees from start to finish, that the review decisions considered a project’s “alignment” with the administration’s political priorities, and even that the review decisions themselves were explicitly “subjective” rather than governed by an objective evaluation process. Perhaps not surprisingly as a result, committee staff have received reports from awardees that the termination notices sent by DOE were littered with factual inaccuracies.

During the briefing, DOE lawyers disclosed the following information to committee staff:

The decisions to terminate the awards were made entirely by a group of eight or nine political appointees serving on an ad hoc “review committee” set up solely to evaluate project cancellations.

The process to cancel these awards took only two weeks, from start to finish.

The review committee considered each award and made its decisions based on nothing more than a one-page summary memo for each project, which was drafted by yet another political appointee.

The review committee employed a set of eight vague and opaque criteria to determine which awards would be terminated, including such criteria as “market analysis,” “technology,” and “national security.”

The review committee made its cancellation decisions based upon an explicitly “subjective” analysis of the eight criteria, without any requirement for a numerical score or evaluation to inform its final decisions. The review committee did not even establish an official number of criteria that a project would need to “pass” or “fail” before undertaking its review. Termination decisions could be made based upon any combination of criteria, and there was no independent expert review process to support these highly consequential determinations.

The merit-based process by which these projects were awarded was disregarded.

More cancellations are set to take place using this same process. The Department is currently evaluating projects from the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office, the Grid Deployment Office, and additional projects in OCED.

On June 18, you appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and confirmed the involvement of DOE’s political appointees in the termination of these awards. This is highly unusual and counter to longstanding DOE precedent. It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards. Expert career officials within DOE assembled and utilized independent expert panels to carry out initial application evaluations. Final award recommendations were only made to a career Senior Executive Service employee within OCED. Political appointees within DOE were not even informed of who applied for these awards until the final selections were made, and they were only informed of these selections two days before the Department provided notification of these awards to relevant Congressional Committees.

In order to maintain the integrity of the Department’s merit-based review processes, political appointees have not historically participated in evaluating project applications. Such a capricious departure from independent, merit-based agency procedure warrants investigation.

During the June briefing, committee staff requested that the Department produce information to help Congress better understand the nature of these terminations. Despite multiple information requests by the committees, the Department has yet to produce any of the requested materials. We therefore request the Department provide responses to the following questions and produce the requested materials by September 23, 2025:

Please describe in detail the Department’s contract review process prior to terminating the 24 contracts. In your response, please specify the factors considered.

In its May 30, 2025, termination announcement, the Department stated, “[a]fter a thorough and individualized financial review of each award, DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” For each contract terminated, please describe in detail why the Department reached the conclusion the “project failed to advance the energy needs of the American people” and “were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

In its May 15, 2025, announcement, the Department stated, “the DOE has begun requesting additional information needed to evaluate 179 awards.” Does the Department intend to cancel more awarded projects that previously went through a rigorous, merit-based approval processes? If so, does the Department still intend to use the same cancellation process run by political appointees used to cancel OCED projects on May 30?

In addition, please provide the following:

Department officials told the committees that DOE created “one pagers” or “one-page summary memos” for each OCED project considered for cancellation. Please provide copies of these “one pagers” or “one-page summary memos.”

Please provide the assessments completed for each terminated project to determine that they did not sufficiently meet the “eight criteria” referenced in the June briefing.

Please provide the charter for the OCED project review committee, including the date established and a comprehensive list of participants.

We look forward to your prompt response.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced new guidance on New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting requirements to provide much needed clarity for the buildout of essential power generation and reshoring of manufacturing. This action provides flexibility to begin certain building activities that are not related to air emissions, such as installing cement pads, before obtaining a Clean Air Act (CAA) construction permit.

With this action, the Trump EPA is addressing America’s energy needs and promoting the development of data centers critical to making the U.S. the Artificial Intelligence (AI) capital of the world, all while taking necessary steps to protect human health and safeguard our environment.

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “We are continuing to fix this broken system. Today’s guidance is another step to allow the build out of essential power generation, data centers, and manufacturing projects that will bring about America’s Golden Age.”

EPA intends to initiate a rulemaking to revise the definition of “Begin Actual Construction” in EPA’s NSR regulations and codify how permitting authorities may distinguish between emissions units and other parts of a stationary source facility that are not an emissions unit or part of an emissions unit. By doing so it will be easy to understand what parts of construction need an NSR permit and what construction activities can proceed without an NSR permit. This will also allow cut down on construction deadlines.

Background

Trash on the sidewalks, smog hanging in the air, and popular beaches riddled with litter. But some cities have managed to pull it off.

Whether through strict policies, smart investments, or sheer community buy-in, these places stand out in expert rankings as the cleanest in the country.

Here are the top five.

1. Honolulu, Hawaii

Honolulu tops nearly every list. The American Lung Association reports the city has the lowest particle pollution of any U.S. metro, and its beaches are still as immaculate as they look in travel ads.

The Hawaiian paradise isn’t banking only on its scenery. The city has rolled out solar programs, water-saving measures, and a plan to plant 100 million trees by 2031. It’s an ambitious attempt to keep the air as clear as the tourism ads promise.

2. Charlotte, North Carolina

Charlotte keeps scoring high for pollution control, infrastructure, and living conditions. The city reports a 20 percent recycling rate, which is notable since North Carolina doesn’t even require comprehensive recycling statewide.

With modern growth and attention to sanitation, Charlotte has built an image of polish that extends beyond its banking towers.

3. Long Beach, California

Forbes recently crowned Long Beach the cleanest city in America, citing spotless restaurants, solid waste systems, and a high rate of electric car ownership. Locals are helping California’s EV dominance, with nearly half of U.S. sales happening in the state. Tough emissions rules and green building codes add to the city’s eco-friendly reputation.

4. Bellingham, Washington

Bellingham’s location on the Salish Sea could’ve been enough to sell its image, but residents back it up with action. Air quality stays high, particle pollution low, and community groups keep pressure on to protect local ecosystems. Whether it’s safeguarding orcas or reshaping tourism, the city treats its environment as a shared responsibility.

5. Denver, Colorado

Denver is massive, yet 94 percent of surveyed households report no nearby trash. The city has joined federal programs to push hybrid and electric vehicles as a way to tackle ozone issues. Recycling is a weak spot, with rates sitting at just 14 percent, but Denver’s push for cleaner technology and infrastructure makes it a standout in spite of its size.

These cities prove that urban life doesn’t always have to mean choking on smog or dodging litter. With planning, persistence, and people who actually care, clean living is possible.",https://www.vice.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Top-5-Cleanest-Cities-in-the-U.S.-According-to-Experts.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-09-09 14:04:50.440342

The Guidance has eliminated the Five Percent Safe Harbor for most solar and wind facilities.
Going forward, these projects may only rely on the Physical Work Test to demonstrate tax credit eligibility.
Under the Physical Work Test, the taxpayer must demonstrate that physical work “of a significant nature” has and is occurring.
Securing custom-manufactured components may be critical to establishing “construction begun” status under the Physical Work Test.","On August 15, 2025, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Notice 2025-42 (Guidance), updating the rules on when construction is considered to have “begun” for purposes of claiming either the production tax credit (PTC) under Section 45Y or the investment tax credit (ITC) under Section 48E for certain solar and wind facilities.

The Guidance responds directly to two recent developments:

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), enacted on July 4, 2025, phases out the Section 45Y and 48E credits for certain solar and wind facilities. Facilities where construction begins after July 4, 2026, and are placed in service after December 31, 2027, are no longer eligible.

Executive Order (EO) No. 14315 – Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources (July 7, 2025). The EO directs Treasury to take additional actions to “strictly enforce the termination” of these credits for solar and wind facilities.

Key Takeaways

1. Safe Harbor for Financial Expenditure Eliminated for Most Projects. Previously, solar and wind project taxpayers could claim eligibility for the tax credits by showing that construction had “begun” by either (1) starting physical work of a significant nature (the Physical Work Test), or (2) using the Five Percent Safe Harbor (i.e., incurring at least 5% of total eligible project costs). The Guidance has eliminated the Five Percent Safe Harbor for most solar and wind facilities. Going forward, these projects may only rely on the Physical Work Test to demonstrate tax credit eligibility.

Under the Physical Work Test, the taxpayer must demonstrate that physical work “of a significant nature” has and is occurring. This can include:

Off-site work: manufacturing custom components, mounting equipment, and support structures (e.g., racks, rails, inverters, and transformers).

On-site work: excavating foundation, setting anchor bolts in the ground, pouring concrete pads for the foundation, and installing racks or other structures to affix photovoltaic panel collectors or solar cells to the site.

Preliminary activities are still not considered significant in nature. Preliminary activities: planning, designing, exploring, researching, mapping, modeling, obtaining permits/licenses, conducting surveys, performing environmental studies, clearing a site, conducting test drilling, excavating to change the contour of the land, and removing existing foundations, turbines, or towers.

Exception: Small-scale solar facilities with a maximum net output of 1.5 MW (AC) or less may still use the Five Percent Safe Harbor in addition to the Physical Work Test to claim credit eligibility.

2. Guidance Effective September 2, 2025. The Guidance is effective as of September 2, 2025. As a result, facilities that could satisfy either the Physical Work Test or the Safe Harbor before September 2, 2025, may still claim credit eligibility under the prior rules.

3. Continuity Test Remains. Taxpayers must maintain a continuous program of construction involving physical work of a significant nature. Certain disruptions remain excusable, including severe weather, natural disasters, government permitting delays, or manufacturing delays for custom components.

Next Steps

Most solar and wind project developers will need to move quickly to preserve eligibility for tax credits. Under the new rules:

Most projects that begin construction between September 2, 2025 and July 4, 2026, may only qualify for Section 45Y or 48E credits by meeting the Physical Work Test.

Projects that begin construction before July 4, 2026, must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for Section 45Y or 48E credits.

Projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 will not qualify for either the 45Y or 48E credit.

A surge in demand for equipment, components, and construction services is likely as developers accelerate project timelines. Expect strained supply chains, higher pricing, and longer lead times for key materials such as solar modules, inverters, and transformers.

BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen unveiled their new electric vehicles at the biennial IAA Mobility show, which began Tuesday in Munich, with a level of excitement and self-assuredness that had been absent in recent years.

That attitude comes after years of headwinds, as the manufacturers watched Chinese start-ups come to dominate the E.V. industry by leaping ahead with electric and hybrid technology that they were able to develop, scale and bring to market faster than their European counterparts.

German automakers were also clobbered by billions in losses after Mr. Trump hit European automakers with tariffs of 27.5 percent in April. They have since been reduced to 15 percent, but that rate has yet to be applied.

But after investing hundreds of billions in new technology and software, the Germans are offering new models that have competitive charging times, driving range and customer-driven entertainment systems.

“We are going on the offensive,” Oliver Blume, chief executive of Volkswagen, told reporters on Monday. And Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes, described “a spirit of optimism” rippling through the German automobile industry, which he said “is investing like never before, with an eye to the future.”

Doing so will be a tall order, as the Chinese cars are still often cheaper, despite tariffs imposed by the European Union, allowing them to more than double their share of the European market in the past year.

“BYD is in Europe to stay,” Stella Li, the company’s executive vice president, told reporters in Munich, where the Chinese carmaker and global leader in E.V. sales unveiled its first station wagon for Europe, a plug-in hybrid version of its popular Seal model. It will be produced in Hungary.

The Chinese start-up Leapmotor, which has a partnership with the global carmaker Stellantis, presented a new hatchback intended to appeal to younger drivers. Xpeng, which is opening a research and development center in Munich, unveiled its Next P7, a model that relies on artificial intelligence to power its systems.

Chinese brands have more than doubled their share of sales in Europe over the past year, according to JATO Dynamics. In May, they reached 5.9 percent of total sales across the continent, up from the 2.9 percent a year earlier.

In the same month, however, Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis — which in Europe makes Fiat, Peugeot and Jeep — topped the list of carmakers registering the most vehicles on the continent, reflecting the brand loyalty many buyers there have.

Aware of the power of their heritage, BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen referenced their legacies, in look and feel.

For BMW, that meant combining its fully electric Neue Klasse iX3 S.U.V. model with lines and lights that reference sedans of the 1960s, with a panoramic dashboard, improved efficiency driven by a lithium-ion battery and high-performance computers and software.

The iX3, which will go on sale next year, can travel up to 497 miles on one charge, and can add 229 miles in 10 minutes.

The fully electric version of Mercedes’ best-selling model, the GLC, features a grill illuminated with 942 dots, a nod to the original Maybach honeycomb radiator. In the latest version, which goes on sale next year, a lithium-ion battery provides a maximum range of 443 miles and the capability to recapture a quarter of that after just 10 minutes of charging.

The German models also integrate intelligent elements, like the hitch on the iX3 that automatically flips out or folds away at the touch of a button. On the GLC, pressing the Mercedes star logo on the hood pops the frunk, or front storage compartment, which can fit two carry-on bags.

The company has been squeezed between its losses in the Chinese market and the “several billion euros” that Mr. Blume attributed to the U.S. tariffs on European cars. Both Audi or Porsche, two of the top-selling Volkswagen brands in the United States, are imported.

Volkswagen, which already employs 5,500 people at its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., is considering more large-scale investments in the United States, contingent on an agreement that Mr. Blume said he was discussing with the Trump administration.

“We are not expecting that the tariffs will be lowered for Volkswagen, but the United States must give something before we will make such investments,” Mr. Blume said, without elaborating.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/09/multimedia/09biz-germany-auto-01-fqpk/09biz-germany-auto-01-fqpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:05:00.952111

For investors, U.S. LNG represents not just an energy export play but a geopolitical and economic linchpin in Asia’s evolving energy landscape.","The United States has emerged as a dominant force in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, with its export capacity and strategic positioning offering a compelling case for long-term investment. As Asian demand for cleaner energy sources evolves amid geopolitical turbulence and supply competition, U.S. LNG’s durability hinges on its ability to adapt to shifting dynamics while leveraging its competitive advantages.

Geopolitical Shifts: A Tailwind for U.S. LNG

The U.S. has capitalized on geopolitical uncertainties to solidify its role as a critical LNG supplier to Asia. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted traditional gas corridors, forcing Europe to pivot to LNG imports and indirectly increasing global prices. This volatility has pushed Asian nations—particularly China, Japan, and South Korea—to diversify their energy portfolios. For instance, Japan secured a 20-year LNG contract with

in 2025, while South Korea and Indonesia have inked long-term deals to offset reliance on Qatari and Australian supplies [1].

U.S.-China trade tensions have further accelerated this trend. Reciprocal tariffs under the Trump administration incentivized Asian countries to rebalance trade relationships by importing U.S. LNG. South Korea, for example, committed to purchasing $100 billion in U.S. energy products under a revised trade agreement in July 2025, reducing tariffs from 25% to 15% and signaling a strategic alignment [2]. These contracts are not merely economic but geopolitical, as nations seek to decouple from adversarial powers and stabilize energy security amid regional tensions.

Supply Competition: U.S. vs. Traditional Exporters

While Qatar and Australia remain key players, the U.S. is outpacing them in new capacity additions. By 2027, U.S. LNG export facilities on the Gulf Coast are projected to add over 68 million metric tons per annum (MTPA), compared to Qatar’s planned expansion from 77 to 142 MTPA by 2030 [3]. Australia’s export capacity is also constrained by existing long-term contracts tied to oil-indexed pricing, which limits its flexibility in a market increasingly favoring spot-indexed deals [4].

Russia, the fourth-largest LNG exporter in 2024, faces headwinds due to Western sanctions and the EU’s ban on transshipping Russian LNG. This has created a vacuum in Asian markets that U.S. suppliers are filling. In Q2 2025, the U.S. supplied more LNG than Qatar and Australia combined, with Japan, South Korea, and India accounting for 33% of U.S. exports [5]. The flexibility of U.S. LNG—rooted in shorter contracts and price competitiveness—positions it to outmaneuver rivals in a buyers’ market.

Renewable Energy Transitions: A Double-Edged Sword

The rise of renewables in Asia poses both challenges and opportunities for U.S. LNG. While solar and wind energy are displacing coal and LNG in some markets—India’s solar projects, for example, are projected to surpass LNG imports by 2026 [6]—natural gas remains a transitional bridge for grid stability. China’s energy transition, though ambitious, is unlikely to eliminate gas demand by 2060 due to market liberalization delays and structural uncertainties [7].

Moreover, LNG’s role as a “bridge fuel” is reinforced by its lower carbon intensity compared to coal. India, aiming to boost natural gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030, is expanding LNG infrastructure, including over 40 terminals by 2025 [8]. Even as renewables grow, U.S. LNG’s ability to complement intermittent solar and wind generation ensures its relevance in Asia’s energy mix.

Pricing Dynamics and Infrastructure: Keys to Resilience

U.S. LNG’s competitiveness is underpinned by infrastructure investments and pricing agility. The Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, now the largest U.S. export facility, has enabled rapid scaling of exports to Asia. Meanwhile, Asian spot prices must fall to $8–$8.5/mmbtu by 2030 to remain competitive with renewables, down from $12/mmbtu in 2024 [9]. U.S. suppliers, with their flexible contracts and proximity to key markets, are better positioned to adjust to these price pressures than Qatari or Australian exporters tied to rigid, oil-indexed agreements.

However, challenges persist. South Korea’s refining infrastructure, optimized for Middle Eastern heavy crude, limits its ability to fully leverage U.S. light crude [10]. Similarly, India’s LNG infrastructure, though expanding, struggles with last-mile connectivity to remote areas. These bottlenecks highlight the need for continued investment in regasification terminals and pipeline networks to sustain demand growth.

Conclusion: A Strategic, Resilient Play

The U.S. LNG market’s long-term durability in Asia rests on its ability to navigate geopolitical currents, outcompete traditional exporters, and adapt to the renewable transition. While oversupply risks and price volatility loom, the U.S. advantage lies in its flexible contracts, strategic partnerships, and infrastructure momentum.

Conclusion: A Policy-Driven Pivot The OBBBA's expiration of EV tax credits is not merely a regulatory change—it is a strategic inflection point.","The expiration of the U.S. federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit on September 30, 2025, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) marks a seismic shift in the clean energy landscape. This policy reversal, enacted by a Republican-led Congress, accelerates the phaseout of incentives that had fueled a decade of growth in EV adoption and renewable infrastructure. For strategic investors, the implications are profound: capital flows are recalibrating, long-term priorities are reshaping, and the risk-reward calculus for clean energy ventures is being rewritten.

The Policy Shockwave: From Incentive to Overcapacity

The OBBBA's abrupt termination of the $7,500 EV tax credit—originally slated to expire in 2032—has triggered a cascade of market adjustments. Battery producers, once buoyed by the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) $200 billion in clean energy incentives, now face a surplus crisis. BloombergNEF data reveals that U.S. battery deployment projections have plummeted by 56% since 2022, with $6 billion in manufacturing projects canceled in Q1 2025 alone. Freyr Battery's abandoned $2.6 billion Georgia facility and GM's $7,500 Bolt EV price cut exemplify the sector's scramble to adapt.

The surplus is not merely a short-term blip. Harvard's Willy Shih warns of a “bullwhip effect,” where initial overproduction gives way to underproduction as demand wanes. This dynamic threatens to erode U.S. competitiveness against China, whose battery manufacturers continue to expand capacity at a rate three times global demand. For investors, the lesson is clear: overexposure to transportation-focused battery tech now carries heightened risk.

Renewable Infrastructure: A Sector in Transition

The OBBBA's impact extends beyond EVs. Solar and wind energy, once beneficiaries of IRA-era tax credits, now face a truncated timeline for deployment. Projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for remaining incentives, forcing developers to prioritize speed over scale. This has spurred a surge in modular, rapidly deployable technologies—such as pre-fabricated solar arrays and microgrid solutions—but at the cost of long-term innovation.

Meanwhile, nuclear and geothermal energy have emerged as relative safe havens. The OBBBA preserves production tax credits (PTC) for nuclear until 2028 and extends geothermal incentives through 2033. These sectors, less reliant on consumer demand and more aligned with baseload power needs, offer investors a counterbalance to the EV sector's volatility.

Alternative Energy Innovation: R&D in a Race Against Time

Hydrogen and advanced manufacturing technologies are also feeling the OBBBA's pressure. The hydrogen production tax credit (Section 45V) is set to expire by 2027, pushing developers toward biomass gasification and blue hydrogen over capital-intensive green hydrogen. Similarly, solar R&D is pivoting to cost-effective, rapid-deployment solutions, with companies like

and SunPower accelerating modular panel designs.

Investors must weigh the urgency of these timelines. While the Treasury Department's August 2025 guidance on the Physical Work Test provides some clarity, the compressed deadlines leave little room for error. For example, Tesla's recent pivot to grid-scale battery storage—eligible for a 40% ITC until 2032—highlights the sector's strategic shift.

Strategic Investor Preparedness: Navigating the New Normal

For investors, the key lies in hedging against policy-driven volatility while capitalizing on emerging opportunities:

Diversify Exposure: Shift capital from EV-centric bets (e.g., lithium mining, battery production) to sectors with extended tax credits, such as nuclear and geothermal.

Prioritize Resilience: Target companies with state-level incentives (e.g., California's Fast Charge Project, Oregon's Clean Vehicle Rebate Program) to mitigate federal policy risks.

Leverage Grid Storage: Invest in firms like Fluence or , which are adapting EV battery tech for grid-scale applications.

Monitor Supply Chain Shifts: Watch for consolidation in the battery sector as overcapacity forces mergers or exits, creating value opportunities.

Conclusion: A Policy-Driven Pivot

The OBBBA's expiration of EV tax credits is not merely a regulatory change—it is a strategic inflection point. Investors who recognize the shift from consumer-driven EV growth to infrastructure-focused resilience will be best positioned to navigate the next phase of the clean energy transition. As the U.S. recalibrates its energy priorities, the winners will be those who adapt to a landscape where policy, not just technology, defines the path forward.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 15:03:47.297108

At the center of this year’s reauthorization fight are a number of controversial concessions that former Gov. Jerry Brown gave to various industries – including oil and gas – when the Legislature last renewed the program in 2017. Those include giveaways that allow fossil fuel companies and others to emit greenhouse gases free of charge, as well as permission for some market participants to purchase questionably effective carbon offsets to meet emissions targets.

To the chagrin of environmental advocates, Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this summer proposed reupping the program as-is, an early sign of his blossoming friendliness with the fuel industry as he eyes a presidential bid in 2028.

The twist? There’s no bill. And even if the text of legislation comes out by the Wednesday deadline to introduce it, opponents argue that such a critical policy should not be rushed through at the last minute.

“We are in the last week of session, and no one has seen the language of what a program would look like,” read a pamphlet that lobbyists from the business community were circulating to members in the Capitol Monday. “Rushing a bad deal to determine the next 20 years of climate policy is the wrong approach.”

Even some environmental advocates who want to see the program renewed have griped about the opacity of the negotiations, which have primarily unfolded behind closed doors. While the Assembly has circulated draft language that closely resembles Newsom’s proposal, the Senate has kept its language under lock and key. According to two people familiar with the negotiations, Senate President Pro Tem’s Mike McGuire’s staff has only allowed members to view the proposed legislative text in person and prohibited them from bringing copies – printed, digital or photos – back to their staff.

Environmental justice advocates have long criticized the cap-and-trade program for failing to reduce pollution at refineries and other industrial sources, which are often located in low-income and minority communities. Because cap and trade allows companies to comply with greenhouse gas limits by buying credits, large polluters can continue operating in low-income neighborhoods without improving air quality or reducing emissions

Proponents of swift reauthorization say the carbon market needs certainty that the program will continue to exist in order to keep pulling in revenues. Over the past 11 years, almost $13 billion from cap-and-trade auctions has paid for electric vehicles, public transit, clean energy and other projects to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change.

A flurry of appeals to lawmakers

As lawmakers entered the Capitol on Monday, a welcoming committee of lobbyists and advocates descended on them, armed with pamphlets urging the members to halt negotiations over cap and trade and kick the conversation to next year.

The opponents included representatives from the fossil fuels industry, business groups and even the state’s influential trade unions, who often have the ear of Democrats in Sacramento but many of whose members are employed by the oil and gas industry and other major polluters.

They argued that a rushed plan to reauthorize cap and trade would unnecessarily raise costs on industries ranging from cement production to oil and gas and manufacturing and push them out of California. That, the groups argue, would result in job losses as well as higher prices as companies pass their increased costs along to consumers.

“No deal is better than a bad deal,” read a notice sent to members from the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California and obtained by CalMatters. “Negotiations on this complex and essential policy should be halted and picked back up in the earliest days of 2026 when the Legislature reconvenes.”

Learn more about legislators mentioned in this story.

The union argued that the Legislature’s proposals would lead to “massive industrial job losses” and “skyrocketing fuel and retail costs” that would harm California families.

“We are disappointed that the Legislature has not been able to work with the Building Trades and the energy industry to advance a clean extension of cap and trade that prioritizes affordability,” the pamphlet read.

The California Chamber of Commerce, a business advocacy group that often finds itself on the opposite side of the trades union, agreed that the shortened timeline wasn’t sufficient to produce a “robust and responsible” piece of legislation.

“For months, we have heard promises that issues affecting California’s affordability were at the top of the list,” said Jennifer Barrera, group’s president and CEO. “But this vital issue will have to wait.”

While mainstream environmental groups like Environmental Defense Fund generally support reauthorizing the program, they’re irked about the obscure nature of the negotiations. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates say that the flood of last-minute lobbying to delay the reauthorization came because they were finally making progress at the negotiating table.

“They’re saying that because they’re losing ground,” said Katie Valenzuela, a lobbyist for environmental justice groups. “These folks have unprecedented access to members in the building, and so for them to argue that there needs to be more public process is just comical.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090123_suspense_rl_cm_081757381219.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=bKaO9rgY,N,,2025-09-09 16:03:54.843104

Harris, who six years ago celebrated $270,000 in solar and energy efficiency grants to farms and small businesses in his Eastern Shore district, has switched gears. Solar energy is “undependable,” he said recently in supporting the Agriculture Department’s decision to stop supporting solar arrays on prime farmland.

The chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee is far from alone. He and other Republicans have turned against solar development in farm country since the Biden administration and Democrats boosted renewable energy grants in their climate law. Republicans are following the lead of President Donald Trump, who’s deemed solar energy — along with wind energy — “the scam of the century.”

Lawmakers are reacting to a real trend. Land that used to be planted with crops is increasingly being covered by solar arrays, including in Harris’ congressional district on the Eastern Shore, a top poultry-producing area. Since 2012, the USDA said, solar panels on farmland have increased by nearly 50 percent, helping to make less land available for beginning farmers.

The American Farm Bureau Federation, the biggest lobbying group for farmers, has estimated that as much as 1.25 million acres of U.S. farmland has been converted to solar energy production, although that’s a small fraction of the 879 million acres of farmland in the country.

The evidence is clear in Harris’ district, where solar arrays now share the landscape with the long narrow barns that mark poultry farms. But if the administration’s — and Congress’ — goal is to keep solar panels from covering wide swaths of land, advocates say smaller farms like the ones Harris calls neighbors may stand to lose the most.

The debate is now pulling in the Rural Energy for America Program, established by a different name in 2002 and extended as REAP in the 2008 farm bill. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced in August that it’s cutting support for solar systems in REAP and won’t allow any USDA-funded solar projects to include components made in China or other adversarial countries.

REAP isn’t for mega-solar farms. Instead, it covers modest energy efficiency improvements on farms, in recent years shifting heavily toward small or medium-sized solar energy systems. The systems are built either on roofs — which seem less caught in the administration’s crosshairs — or on the ground.

Advocates for REAP say they’re puzzled by the new Republican skepticism because most of the program’s grants go to congressional districts represented by Republicans. That includes funding from the Democrats’ hallmark climate bill during the Biden administration, the Inflation Reduction Act.

For the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, the Trump administration asked Congress to eliminate REAP’s $50 million in discretionary spending for all types of projects. Appropriators rejected the request in committee-passed bills, but the final versions have yet to pass.

Several Republican lawmakers have lined up behind Rollins’ solar rollback, including Agriculture Committee members Austin Scott of Georgia and Mike Bost of Illinois.

Bost said in the USDA news release that prime farmland “is too valuable for producing the food and fuel our nation depends on,” although he’s proposed legislation that would allow subsidies for projects of 1 to 5 acres if farmers take measures to protect soil health.

Scott has navigated the issue over several years, at once praising REAP — including loan guarantees and grants for solar and wind projects as an important part of the farm bill that can save energy and help boost farm income — and criticizing the conversion of irrigated farmland, at the same hearing.

Conversion of productive cropland, Scott said at a 2020 Agriculture subcommittee hearing on rural energy, “is an indication that perhaps the solar subsidies are too generous.”

A spokesperson for Scott, Hunter Kirkland, declined Thursday to elaborate on which solar projects the lawmaker believes warrant subsidies and which don’t.

‘Not a great narrative now for farmers’

Solar proponents say the real threat to farmland is residential developments, especially where land values give farmers a strong incentive to sell.

“The danger of losing this prime farmland is that they’re going to sell to a developer,” said Liz Perera, senior director of national program and policy at the Coalition for Community Solar Access.

With community solar projects — which power multiple homes and businesses — the soil stays intact and can eventually be returned to agricultural use, Perera said. The two can even be combined, but neither farmers nor the USDA have fully latched onto agrovoltaics, or solar panels that coexist with crops or livestock.

Ideally, groups said, the USDA would continue to support agrovoltaics. The American Farmland Trust, which promotes policies to prevent development of farmland, said it would continue to push for agrovoltaics to keep productive land in farming.

As much as two-thirds of U.S. farmland is likely to change hands in the next 20 years, the American Farmland Trust has said. The fight over solar energy could help determine how that land is used.

One of the hurdles for agrovoltaics is a USDA definition that calls solar energy systems industrial and commercial. That precludes farmers from receiving much technical assistance through conservation programs, said Lucy Bullock-Sieger, chief strategy officer for Lightstar Renewables, which builds community solar projects around the U.S. and promotes agrovoltaics.

Solar energy supporters have been pushing the USDA and Congress to change the definition so farmers can qualify for conservation assistance. But what previously seemed like a gray area now seems like a “hard no” at the USDA, said Bullock-Sieger, who’s also chair of the Solar and Farming Association, a trade group.

“Our farmers are very deeply worried,” Bullock-Sieger said, adding that many see solar development as one more way to keep a farm viable. “It’s not a great narrative now for farmers.”

During the Biden administration, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture highlighted research grants for agrovoltaics. The Energy Department also touted the practice.

Big questions about intentions

Rollins, in the department’s news release, didn’t mention USDA research on mixing solar energy with farming.

“It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage,” she said.

The USDA’s announcement has created many questions about the administration’s intentions, outside organizations said.

Some of the uncertainty plays out in the program’s fine print, including how the USDA will treat loan guarantees versus grants.

The announcement said ground-mounted solar systems greater than 50 kilowatt-hours won’t qualify for loan guarantees, nor for the “priority points” used in deciding applications for grants.

The fine print matters because, as Harris noted in an Appropriations Committee markup in 2023, loan guarantees have traditionally been the bigger part of REAP.

The guaranteed loans “allow much more money to be spent in these rural areas for rural energy than a grant program,” Harris said in praising the program’s goals.

Loan guarantees give the best value for REAP money and “unleash tremendous amounts of capital into rural areas for electric supply,” he said.

A spokesperson for Harris said the lawmaker maintains his preference for loans in REAP.

“REAP was intended as a loan program, not the expanded grant program created through the Inflation Reduction Act, and the congressman supports returning it to that original purpose,” Harris’ office said in a statement.

“He applauds USDA’s action to end subsidies for solar projects on prime farmland, protecting America’s farmland for food production and future generations.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/fc/5e/20480e6d4b7e92505681788ce88f/u-s-congress-50375.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:03:10.280534

(NASDAQ: EVGO) today announced their collaborative network now reaches more than 200 locations across nearly 40 states. In just over two years, the companies have worked together to bridge charging gaps by deploying nearly 850 new electric vehicle (EV) fast charging stalls across America. By investing in critical charging infrastructure along essential travel routes, this charging network is enabling drivers to go where they want, when they want, with 24/7 access to high-power chargers and industry-leading amenities.

“Pilot is here to fuel the journeys of all drivers. Our fast-charging network raises the bar for convenience, reliability and exceptional service by offering an experience designed to show EV drivers that they matter,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot. “Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel.”

Expanding this network from 25+ states to nearly 40 in under a year, the companies continue to add charging availability across our nation’s countryside, where only 45% of rural counties had at least one fast charging stall available at the start of 2025.1 Some of the newest states to join this growing network include Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, with significant expansion across Texas, Missouri and Florida.

“Hitting the open road is a natural emblem of American culture, and traveling by car means drivers can set their own schedule to stop and charge when and where they want,” said Badar Khan, CEO of EVgo. “Our EVgo eXtend network, built in collaboration with Pilot and GM, is delivering reliable charging to communities large and small — ensuring freedom of fueling choice for every driver.”

The collaboration between Pilot, GM and EVgo is bringing public fast charging to the country’s interstate travel corridors that carry more than 20 percent of the total traffic in America.2 Pilot and Flying J locations epitomize convenience by combining charging options with an array of amenities, including free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurants, and grocery and convenience items—and EVgo’s 350kW fast-chargers can quickly refill range and get drivers back on the road.

Overhead canopies at many locations protect drivers from sun or snow and pull-through stalls allow drivers who are towing a trailer or traveling in an electric van to easily connect their charging ports. Plug and Charge – a feature that enables compatible EV models to automatically initiate and pay for a charging session simply by plugging in – is available throughout the network for drivers with compatible EV models, making it even easier to power up on the go.

“With over a dozen electric vehicles across Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac, GM is giving customers the right vehicle to take them wherever they want to go: from highway driving to off-road trails,” said Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy. “Through our collaboration with Pilot and EVgo, we’re committed to helping ensure that charging access doesn’t get in the way of your EV journey.”

Pilot, GM, and EVgo first announced their collaboration in 2022 and are now nearly halfway toward their goal of building a total of up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J locations across the U.S. By the end of 2025, the companies anticipate reaching 1,000 stalls across 40 states.

And it’s a further investment in the company’s domestic supply chain, which it has been working to secure since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Origami builds solar panel frames using U.S.-made recycled steel rather than the aluminum that most of the industry relies upon — most of which comes from China, which controls 60% of the world’s smelters.

Gregg Patterson, CEO of the company, which he co-founded in 2019 with a group of fellow solar veterans, said in a 2024 Latitude Media Frontier Forum that aluminum frames are “an Achilles heel for solar,” and that substituting them is key to securing a domestic supply chain for solar.

“The evolution of the world around us has created such a significant risk to imported aluminum frames,” he said at the time, referring to geopolitical and trade tensions that had pushed aluminum prices to historic highs. Things have only gotten worse since then.

Most recently, the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” introduced new “foreign entity of concern” rules, which place further restrictions on solar panels containing materials coming from countries such as China, North Korea, and Iran.

Origami’s U.S.-based fabrication capacity appears to have played an important role in its acquisition by Nextracker. In the press release announcing the deal, Nextracker CEO Dan Shugar notes that using steel for solar panel frames not only offers “greater strength at a competitive cost,” but, “most importantly, it helps to unlock opportunities for localized manufacturing from steel coil through final fabrication.”

Nexttracker has been investing in reshoring its production ever since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the market’s supply chain, leading Shugar to come to the realization that the company had to build more U.S. manufacturing.

The move comes at an uncertain time for the U.S. solar industry, which is being rocked by the OBBB’s earlier-than-expected sunsetting of some supporting tax credits, as well as the new FEOC regulations.

A July 2025 ​​analysis from Princeton’s REPEAT Project estimates that the OBBB could reduce solar’s expected growth by almost 30 gigawatts by 2030, and 140 GW by 2035. According to recent data by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and MIT’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, investment in clean manufacturing is already slowing down, with investment in solar manufacturing in the second quarter of 2025 down 25% compared to the same period last year.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-09T122050.147.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:02:44.969942

“These rules are not a workable solution to our resiliency problems,” said Ray Cantor, vice president of government affairs at NJBIA.
That just should be it.” Several environmental experts endorsed the DEP’s revised rules during Wednesday night’s virtual hearing.
“The sound science that backs these regulations call for us to be more resilient over time,” said Jen Coffey, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions.
The DEP, which is hoping to formally adopt the revised rules by January, will continue taking written comments through Sept. 19.","Officials from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection held a virtual hearing on recently revised rules aimed at protecting towns from destructive floods and sea level rise. These proposed rules include safe building standards defining flood risk zones that will determine how high residents need to raise their homes or where developers must plan for stronger flood resistance.

After the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection eased some aspects of its proposed Resilient Environments and Landscapes rules, the rules remain controversial and are opposed by many Jersey Shore mayors, builders and business groups, including the New Jersey Business & Industry Association.

“These rules are not a workable solution to our resiliency problems,” said Ray Cantor, vice president of government affairs at NJBIA. “There’s still major flaws with this rule. It’s going to have a major negative impact on our coastal and river towns. It’s going to harm our urban redevelopment.”

Major changes made by the DEP include lowering building elevation requirements from 5 feet down to 4 feet above the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s base flood levels.

Beach Haven Mayor Colleen Lambert said, “Beach Haven has quite a large historic district. And we still haven’t heard a lot about how that’s supposed to be dealt with because obviously to raise all those old homes would be virtually impossible.”

“We still don’t have a robust evaluation of the economic impact of the rule,” said Grant Lucking, CEO of the New Jersey Builders Association. “I say that because there’s still no mention of exactly how many properties would be impacted by the new floodplain and how that will affect their value. Some studies suggest it could cause a ten percent devaluation of a property.”

One speaker, a homeowner in Forked River, who spoke up in favor of the DEP’s proposal, said, “As a homeowner I realize that we have a huge problem.” Kelly Smentkowski added, “The water is rising. I look at it every day. So if people don’t realize it because they don’t live on the water, shame on them.”

Smentkowski, who lives right on Barnegat Bay, says her property is eroding despite an offshore barrier reef of baby oysters installed by the American Littoral Society. The whole area is under siege and losing its shoreline. Her front yard is almost all underwater.

“This property went out 185 feet in the ‘70s, from this point. In the last 10-15 years, it’s lost 50-60 feet,” Smentkowski said.

“I do think that builders and the towns, even though they want revenue and taxes, there should be areas that you just can’t build on if you know that the ground is eroding and you’re losing property. They shouldn’t be able to sell that property. That just should be it.”

Several environmental experts endorsed the DEP’s revised rules during Wednesday night’s virtual hearing.

“The sound science that backs these regulations call for us to be more resilient over time,” said Jen Coffey, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions. “Rather than passing the buck to the future and telling future generations to deal with the impacts, what we are saying with these regulations is, we know sea level rises are happening.”

“We’re protecting residents,” said Michael Pisauro, policy director for the Watershed Institute. “We’re protecting businesses from the damage of flooding, from having to be put out of business, from customers not being able to get there, people not being able to get to their jobs and buildings destroyed and damaged and people who’ve lost their lives. And that’s what resilience means, that’s what these rules mean, taking steps to trying to protect.”

Some environmentalists said the DEP made too many concessions to developers. They especially dislike a rule change that would permit exemptions for developers building affordable housing in a flood zone and asked the DEP to restore the stricter standards.

“By lowering the standards, the state risks enabling development in areas that face chronic flooding within the lifespan of infrastructure of housing projects. This is not precautionary planning. It is a gamble with public safety and taxpayer dollars,” said Tracy Gordon, the outreach and advocacy coordinator for Raritan Headwaters.

The DEP, which is hoping to formally adopt the revised rules by January, will continue taking written comments through Sept. 19.

The rules are also a flashpoint in the state’s governor’s race. Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli has vowed the proposed rules would be “DOA when I’m governor.” Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill has called for a “smart and responsible balance” that protects coastal areas without hampering economic development, especially new housing.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/02/Jersey-Shore-flooding-Strathmere-Cape-May-County.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:03:19.634600

There may be some as end-of-year sales pushes start to happen, but nothing approaching what the federal tax credit could employ.","It was a good run while it lasted if you were in the market for a new electric vehicle, but the moment is now almost upon us: The federal tax credit for EV purchases ends on Sept. 30. The program that has helped incentivize the purchase or lease of a new or used EV for hundreds of thousands of buyers over the course of more than a decade is being phased out by the Trump administration, and it’s left many wondering what comes after that moment for both consumers and manufacturers.

We had a look at the state of the American car market to see what shoppers should know right now, what they should do right now, what comes after that deadline, and what vehicles and automakers might be most affected by what comes after the tax credit ends.

Related: Thinking About Getting an EV Before the Tax Credit Ends?

What You Should Do Now if You Want That Credit

Key takeaway: Shoppers should purchase and take delivery of an EV before Oct. 1 if they want to claim the federal EV tax credit even though an IRS loophole may allow them to receive the tax credit without taking delivery if they sign documents and make a payment by the Sept. 30 deadline. Shoppers should also look for automaker and local incentives for potential savings.

First, there are a couple of things to know. The federal EV tax credit is just that: a deduction on your income tax for the year provided you qualify for it. Not everyone does — maybe you make too much money or maybe the car you’re looking at doesn’t qualify — and it requires some paperwork when you file your taxes in April. It’s not a discount, either; you don’t get that chunk of change off the price of an EV unless you take the step of transferring that credit to the dealership (which is what many dealers do and does allow you to take that chunk of change off the transaction price at the start). The tax credit can make a lot of EVs more affordable or help get you out from a pandemic-era car loan that might be underwater.

With that out of the way, if you want to make sure you secure that EV incentive, go out and get one before the clock ticks over to Oct. 1. To be doubly sure you get that credit, take delivery before then, too. As of this writing, the IRS has thrown a bit of a curveball at buyers, saying that as long as you’ve signed the documents and made a payment before the end of day Sept. 30, you don’t have to take immediate delivery in order to get the credit. But how this factors into the requirements for vehicle registration and titling is unclear, leading many dealers to try and figure it out themselves. The simplest solution is to simply get it all done now, as fast as possible, and take delivery of your car before the deadline hits.

This doesn’t factor in the possibility of additional incentives automakers are piling onto EVs this month as extra motivators to get them off dealer lots, either. Some brands are doing gangbuster financing deals, while others are doing lease deals (the $7,500 tax credit can be applied to leasing, as well, often more easily than a financed purchase).

The federal tax credit is not the only government spiff that you might qualify for. Many states and municipalities also have local credits, rebates and incentives that aren’t reliant on the federal credit, so it’s worth checking your locality for any such possible programs. Altogether, the next couple of weeks might be the best time ever to get a new EV in terms of what your out-the-door cost and monthly payments might look like.

What Happens After the EV Tax Credit Ends?

Key takeaway: With the upcoming expiration of the federal tax credit, automakers are reevaluating their pricing, production and future models, and future incentives will depend on inventory levels.

This is a bit of a gray area. With the federal incentives going away, automakers are going to be left with some difficult choices on pricing, supply and future models, but what they do in the coming months will likely depend on just how many EVs are left on dealer lots and in the shipping pipeline after Sept. 30. If dealerships sell a lot of their inventory this month, we’re not likely to see many automaker incentives on the hood of remaining vehicles. There may be some as end-of-year sales pushes start to happen, but nothing approaching what the federal tax credit could employ. However, if automakers don’t see significant sales this month, discounts could be employed to clean out the rest of the stock in October and November, especially as the model year comes to a close.

But we’re also already starting to see automakers adjust production for the second half of the year, slowing new EV assembly, canceling some models and reducing imports (partly for the disappearance of the credit, partly for the institution of tariffs). For instance, GM has partially idled its factory that makes its big electric trucks, affecting the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ, and Mercedes-Benz has stopped taking orders for some of its EQ line of vehicles.

Are Affordable EVs Done?

Key takeaway: Though it’s likely that new EVs will see increased pricing, automakers should be focusing on producing more affordable EVs. Meanwhile, prices for used EVs are declining.

Absolutely not. In fact, there’s a new push by automakers to continue to offer EVs that are more affordable than ever. The first one, the 2026 Nissan Leaf, arrives in dealerships by fall with a starting price of $31,485 (including destination). The 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV is just on the verge of being revealed, as well, with a price expected to at least match the Leaf, if not beat it. Meanwhile, Hyundai’s Kona EV and Chevy’s Equinox EV are also reasonably priced. The pressure to make cheap EVs is not letting up anytime soon, especially as the Chinese market is driving the world’s automakers to find new ways of driving down cost.

While new EVs are likely to see their transaction prices increase due to the loss of the credit, used-EV prices (which have been declining steadily thanks to high inventory and a plethora of affordable models under $25,000) are selling quickly, too, according to Cars.com data. As the depreciation on new EVs is pretty hefty, used offerings make for an interesting, cost-effective option for a lot of EV intenders and used-car buyers in general.

Here’s the interesting part: This longtime tax credit has helped the industry get a lot of EVs into consumer hands at prices that they otherwise would not have been able to afford. Over the last decade, the biggest factor in driving down overall EV cost has been battery cost, which has been reduced to nearly $100 per kilowatt-hour and is continuing to fall quickly, mostly thanks to Chinese efforts in new technology and economies of scale. But the electric car market isn’t going away anytime soon, especially in foreign markets, meaning there will still be EVs to buy here in the U.S. even after the federal tax credit ends. What the end of the EV tax credit is doing, however, is forcing automakers to reevaluate their overall strategy for bringing the next generation of EVs to market.

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) provided today preliminary analysis of the negative impacts the Trump Administration’s stop work order on the Revolution Wind project will have on near-term energy costs for Connecticut ratepayers, and ratepayers throughout the New England region, as well as the reliability of our regional electric grid.

On August 22, 2025, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a stop work order halting all offshore construction on the Revolution Wind project, which is 80% complete.

Energy Affordability Impacts

DEEP estimates that if the Revolution Wind project is canceled, the near-term cost to New England electric ratepayers would be roughly half a billion dollars per year, in the form of higher regional energy market costs, due to the loss of this affordable and reliable offshore wind power. Connecticut ratepayers would shoulder 25% of these higher regional costs.

DEEP has prepared a preliminary analysis of energy market impacts that estimates that the Revolution Wind project will lower near-term wholesale energy and capacity market costs for Connecticut and all New England ratepayers, by providing fuel diversity and low-marginal cost energy to our region. By 2028, these wholesale market savings are estimated to reach roughly $500 million dollars a year.

While the electricity market impacts are expected to affect energy costs New England-wide, Connecticut ratepayers will experience further impacts associated with the 304 MW ratepayer-backed contract with Revolution Wind. Connecticut’s Revolution Wind contract, which has a blended price of $99/MWh for energy and renewable attributes, is further projected to save Connecticut ratepayers an additional $150–200 million in public benefits charges over the life of the 20-year project, savings that would be lost were the project to be canceled. Further details of this analysis are provided here.

Other Impacts of the Stop Work Order

Reliability:

In terms of electric grid reliability, ISO New England, our regional electric grid operator, is counting on the Revolution Wind project to deliver power next year. In a recent statement, the ISO confirmed that it “is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability.”

Reliability in Winter: Offshore wind is a “winter powerhouse” resource: it produces its strongest output in winter, exactly when New England demand peaks and available natural gas supplies (the primary fuel for electricity generation in the region) are at their lowest. ISO-NE CEO Gordon van Welie testified in March 2025 that offshore wind provides “substantial reliability benefits,” “offsetting the effects of constraints on the gas pipeline system” in the winter. During critical peak periods, such as winter cold snaps, offshore wind helps to extend the performance of gas and stored oil in the region when those resources are stressed, strengthening overall grid resilience.

“We estimate that preventing this project from coming online will result in higher electric bills for residents and businesses in Connecticut and the region,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “While these are estimates, the magnitude of these potential impacts is concerning, at a time when we want to see energy bills going down, not up. This action will also make our electric grid less reliable, leaving us more susceptible to blackouts and interruptions, particularly during heat waves and cold snaps, which are becoming more common in New England.”

Jobs and Economic Development:

Revolution Wind supports about 1,200 jobs in Connecticut and Rhode Island.

At the State Pier in New London alone, more than 100 union jobs and nearly 200 overall jobs are tied directly to staging and assembly for offshore wind.

Connecticut invested $200 million to redevelop State Pier into a world-class heavy-lift maritime facility. Developers contributed another $100 million. In addition to Revolution Wind, the State Pier is supporting deployment of two other offshore wind projects (South Fork and Sunrise), enabling 1,760 megawatts (MW) to power more than 1 million homes.

Supply chain: At least 50 Connecticut companies are involved in offshore wind and related port development projects. Beyond Connecticut and Rhode Island, Revolution Wind is supporting hundreds of additional jobs in states across the country through its supplier contracts.

About Revolution Wind:

Revolution Wind is a 704 MW offshore wind project under construction approximately 15 nautical miles southeast of Point Judith, Rhode Island. The project began construction in 2023 and is expected to reach commercial operation in 2026. It will deliver enough electricity to the New England grid to power 350,000 homes, the equivalent of 2.5% of the region’s electricity supply. Revolution Wind is 80% complete and essential for Connecticut and New England’s reliability, affordability, and energy security.

DEEP Staff are available for interviews to discuss these projected affordability and reliability impacts.

Pilot now has electric vehicle fast-charging at more than 200 locations across the country

“Pilot is here to fuel the journeys of all drivers. Our fast-charging network raises the bar for convenience, reliability and exceptional service by offering an experience designed to show EV drivers that they matter,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot. “Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel.”

Expanding this network from 25+ states to nearly 40 in under a year, the companies continue to add charging availability across our nation’s countryside, where only 45% of rural counties had at least one fast charging stall available at the start of 2025. 1 Some of the newest states to join this growing network include Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, with significant expansion across Texas, Missouri and Florida.

“Hitting the open road is a natural emblem of American culture, and traveling by car means drivers can set their own schedule to stop and charge when and where they want,” said Badar Khan, CEO of EVgo. “Our EVgo eXtend network, built in collaboration with Pilot and GM, is delivering reliable charging to communities large and small — ensuring freedom of fueling choice for every driver.”

The collaboration between Pilot, GM and EVgo is bringing public fast charging to the country’s interstate travel corridors that carry more than 20 percent of the total traffic in America. 2 Pilot and Flying J locations epitomize convenience by combining charging options with an array of amenities, including free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurants, and grocery and convenience items—and EVgo’s 350kW fast-chargers can quickly refill range and get drivers back on the road.

Overhead canopies at many locations protect drivers from sun or snow and pull-through stalls allow drivers who are towing a trailer or traveling in an electric van to easily connect their charging ports. Plug and Charge – a feature that enables compatible EV models to automatically initiate and pay for a charging session simply by plugging in – is available throughout the network for drivers with compatible EV models, making it even easier to power up on the go.

“With over a dozen electric vehicles across Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac, GM is giving customers the right vehicle to take them wherever they want to go: from highway driving to off-road trails,” said Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy. “Through our collaboration with Pilot and EVgo, we’re committed to helping ensure that charging access doesn’t get in the way of your EV journey.”

Pilot, GM, and EVgo first announced their collaboration in 2022 and are now nearly halfway toward their goal of building a total of up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J locations across the U.S. By the end of 2025, the companies anticipate reaching 1,000 stalls across 40 states.

In exchange for purchasing the dams and operating them for the next 30 years, Confluence will sell the power back to Consumers Energy.
The 55 employees that operate Consumers' 13 dams will be offered positions with Confluence, once the sales agreement is approved.
We deeply admire and respect the Consumers Energy team and the culture of safety and operational excellence they have built.""","Consumers Energy is selling its 13 hydroelectric dams following a lengthy review process about whether the utility should refurbish the structures themselves, decommission them, or sell them.

The sales agreement is with Confluence Hydro, a subsidiary of a Maryland-based investment company called Hull Street Energy, which will keep the dams up and running for the next 30 years.

In exchange for purchasing the dams, they'll sell the power to Consumers Energy, which will pass it on to customers.

Big picture view:

One of Michigan's largest energy providers is selling its dams that are located along five major rivers throughout the Lower Peninsula.

The decision to sell came after a three-year process of surveying communities that surround the 13 dams while assessing the most cost-effective measure for customers.

The dams are located along the Au Sable River, the Manistee River, the Muskegon River, the Kalamazoo River, and the Grand River. The dams generate close to a hundred megawatts of power.

""We're confident this is the best decision for our customers,"" said Sri Maddipati, president of electric supply at Consumers.

Dig deeper:

Announced during a Tuesday meeting, the company said the sales agreement was worth $13 - $1 per dam with a power purchase agreement. In exchange for purchasing the dams and operating them for the next 30 years, Confluence will sell the power back to Consumers Energy.

The 55 employees that operate Consumers' 13 dams will be offered positions with Confluence, once the sales agreement is approved.

Both the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must green light the sale before it can go forward. The regulatory process is expected to take between 12 and 18 months. Until its complete, Consumers Energy will continue operating the dams.

Hull Street Energy currently owns 47 dams around North America.

The company will be tasked with renewing the dam's operating licenses, which expire in 2034.

What they're saying:

""Safety has always been foundational to everything we do,"" said Ed Quinn, Chief Executive Officer of Confluence Hydro. ""With decades of experience operating hydro facilities, we are committed to preserving and modernizing these important resources to maximize their contribution to the grid. We deeply admire and respect the Consumers Energy team and the culture of safety and operational excellence they have built.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox2detroit.com/www.fox2detroit.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/hardy-dam_autumn_aerial_resized-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-09 13:05:30.686838

Constantin Hesse has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors impacting SMA Solar Technology. The strategic partnership with Create Energy to produce next-generation inverters and Power Skid solutions in the US is a positive development. This collaboration is expected to enhance SMA’s competitive edge by reducing tariffs and benefiting from tax incentives under the revised Inflation Reduction Act. The move to localize production is anticipated to shorten lead times and potentially increase profitability through manufacturing tax credits.

However, despite these strategic advantages, there are concerns that temper the outlook. The demand in SMA’s Home and Business Solutions segment remains weak, which affects the company’s profitability projections for 2025 and limits margin visibility for 2026. Additionally, the slowdown in order momentum for large-scale projects due to regulatory uncertainties adds a layer of caution. A more favorable regulatory outcome and an increase in order momentum could lead to a more optimistic view in the future.

According to TipRanks, Hesse is an analyst with an average return of -1.2% and a 45.66% success rate. Hesse covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as SMA Solar Technology, PVA TePla, and Siltronic.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pilot Company (Pilot), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and EVgo Inc. (NASDAQ: EVGO) today announced their collaborative network now reaches more than 200 locations across nearly 40 states. In just over two years, the companies have worked together to bridge charging gaps by deploying nearly 850 new electric vehicle (EV) fast charging stalls across America. By investing in critical charging infrastructure along essential travel routes, this charging network is enabling drivers to go where they want, when they want, with 24/7 access to high-power chargers and industry-leading amenities.

Pilot now has electric vehicle fast-charging at more than 200 locations across the country

“Pilot is here to fuel the journeys of all drivers. Our fast-charging network raises the bar for convenience, reliability and exceptional service by offering an experience designed to show EV drivers that they matter,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot. “Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel.”

Expanding this network from 25+ states to nearly 40 in under a year, the companies continue to add charging availability across our nation’s countryside, where only 45% of rural counties had at least one fast charging stall available at the start of 2025.1 Some of the newest states to join this growing network include Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, with significant expansion across Texas, Missouri and Florida.

“Hitting the open road is a natural emblem of American culture, and traveling by car means drivers can set their own schedule to stop and charge when and where they want,” said Badar Khan, CEO of EVgo. “Our EVgo eXtend network, built in collaboration with Pilot and GM, is delivering reliable charging to communities large and small — ensuring freedom of fueling choice for every driver.”

The collaboration between Pilot, GM and EVgo is bringing public fast charging to the country’s interstate travel corridors that carry more than 20 percent of the total traffic in America.2 Pilot and Flying J locations epitomize convenience by combining charging options with an array of amenities, including free Wi-Fi, on-site restaurants, and grocery and convenience items—and EVgo’s 350kW fast-chargers can quickly refill range and get drivers back on the road.

Overhead canopies at many locations protect drivers from sun or snow and pull-through stalls allow drivers who are towing a trailer or traveling in an electric van to easily connect their charging ports. Plug and Charge – a feature that enables compatible EV models to automatically initiate and pay for a charging session simply by plugging in – is available throughout the network for drivers with compatible EV models, making it even easier to power up on the go.

“With over a dozen electric vehicles across Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac, GM is giving customers the right vehicle to take them wherever they want to go: from highway driving to off-road trails,” said Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy. “Through our collaboration with Pilot and EVgo, we’re committed to helping ensure that charging access doesn’t get in the way of your EV journey.”

Pilot, GM, and EVgo first announced their collaboration in 2022 and are now nearly halfway toward their goal of building a total of up to 2,000 fast charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J locations across the U.S. By the end of 2025, the companies anticipate reaching 1,000 stalls across 40 states.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated this differential, allowing producers to collect on the full credit even if they are using CO2 to produce more fossil fuels.
The analysis does not address state and local tax breaks for fossil fuel companies, nor does it add up international financing from publicly funded US entities to overseas fossil fuel companies and projects.","The Trump administration has already added nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies for oil, gas, and coal in 2025, a report released Tuesday finds, sending an additional $4 billion out the door each year for fossil fuels over the next decade. That new amount, created with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, adds to $30.8 billion a year in preexisting subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. The report finds that the amount of public money the US will now spend on domestic fossil fuels stands at least $34.8 billion a year.

The increase amounts to “the largest single-year increase in subsidies we’ve seen in many years—at least since 2017,” says Collin Rees, the US program manager for Oil Change International, an anti-fossil fuels advocacy organization and author of the report.

The US has been subsidizing fossil fuel production for more than a century. Many of the tax subsidies logged in the report—including a tax break passed in 1913 that allows companies to write off large amounts of expenses related to drilling new oil wells—have been on the books for decades.

Fossil fuel subsidies have proven notoriously difficult to undo, even with a determined administration. After campaigning on ending tax breaks for Big Oil, President Joe Biden’s 2021 budget pledged to raise $35 billion over 19 years by eliminating certain fossil fuel subsidies; one of his first executive orders tasked agencies with getting rid of those subsidies. (“I don’t think the federal government should give handouts to Big Oil,” he said at a press conference announcing the order.)

But the phaseouts of these subsidies were nixed during climate legislation negotiations with then-senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who was the key swing vote in the Senate at the time and a recipient of fossil fuel money with lengthy ties to the coal industry. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act—the resulting compromise between Manchin and Democratic leadership, which was passed in August of 2022—gave additional boosts to the fossil fuel industry in the form of subsidies for oil-and-gas-friendly technologies, like carbon capture and storage and certain types of hydrogen made with natural gas.

“What happens is you have these policies in place, and then you have a constituency that strongly advocates and lobbies for them, it becomes harder and harder to unwind them, which I think is the situation that we’re in today,” says Matthew Kotchen, a professor of economics at Yale University, who was not involved in the new analysis.

That cycle is continuing in the new administration. Fossil fuel companies spent millions of dollars getting Trump elected last year; one report from the advocacy group Climate Power puts the total number at $445 million. Those companies are seeing benefits as the administration pursues an aggressive deregulatory agenda, hobbles renewable energy projects and downplays the importance of climate change. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the president has taken to calling oil CEOs following their appearances on TV.

“It’s no secret that Trump and the Republicans are on the side of the fossil fuel industry and very much vice versa,” says Rees. “The fossil fuel industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars getting Republicans and Trump elected. They then presented their wish lists. Nearly everything on those wish lists was fulfilled, and in fact, they got a bunch of additional goodies that weren’t even in those wish lists.”

The new research builds on past work from Oil Change International, which last did the math on national fossil fuel subsidies in 2017, finding then that $20 billion was going out the door to the industry each year. To compile the new report, Rees and his colleagues combed through a variety of federal governmental sources on the amount of money going to the oil, gas, and coal industries each year.

The question of what, exactly, constitutes a federal subsidy is the topic of some debate. Environmental groups tend to have a broader scope in tallying up public money spent on fossil fuels, including federal money not distributed directly to oil companies; conservative groups, meanwhile, take a much more narrow approach. (For its report, Oil Change International used the definitions of subsidies set by the World Trade Organization in calculating domestic funding to fossil fuels.)

Due to a lack of transparency across the federal government, the calculations in this report are “likely to be an undercount,” Rees says. “There’s probably some things that we missed—some corners of the budget that are funding fossil fuels in different ways.”

The $4 billion in new yearly subsidies comes largely in the form of allocations contained in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed this summer. One of the biggest new subsidies—an expansion of the tax credit for carbon capture and storage—is, ironically, related to provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Trump campaigned on reversing. (The One Big Beautiful Bill Act did, however, crack down harshly on tax credits for wind and solar, carrying out part of Trump’s campaign promise.)

Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing CO2 emissions and injecting them deep underground. The oil and gas industry has for decades injected CO2 underground to help recover difficult reserves that don’t respond well to traditional drilling methods. Environmentalists have long argued that the logic of replicating an oil and gas technique as a climate solution is seriously flawed—especially considering that a company could reap a climate tax credit from injecting CO2 that will then be used to create more fossil fuels.

In the original Inflation Reduction Act, which significantly expanded the existing carbon capture tax credit, there was a price differential baked into the tax credits: Producers got more money per ton of CO2 they sequestered underground without any oil production involved, and less for CO2 used specifically to produce more oil and gas. But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated this differential, allowing producers to collect on the full credit even if they are using CO2 to produce more fossil fuels. The total expansion of tax credits for carbon capture in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the analysis found, could send out more than $1.4 billion of public money to oil and gas companies each year.

The types of federal subsidies addressed in this report are just one kind of boost the government gives dirty industries. The analysis does not address state and local tax breaks for fossil fuel companies, nor does it add up international financing from publicly funded US entities to overseas fossil fuel companies and projects. (Just before he left office, President Biden backed a limit on funding for dirty investments made by the US Export-Import Bank, a part of the executive branch that facilitates the export of US goods and services; President Trump promptly encouraged the Bank in April to resume funding for coal projects abroad.)

The fossil fuel industry also benefits financially from not having to address the negative side effects of their products: coal companies don’t have to deal with the health impacts from people breathing polluted air, for example, while oil and gas companies don’t need to think about damages from extreme weather juiced up by climate change caused by their product. Kotchen, the Yale economist, calculated in a 2021 paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that a small handful of US oil, gas, coal, and diesel giants, by not having to pay for the damage they cause, get $62 billion in what he calls “implicit subsidies” per year.

I asked him if, given the major environmental rollbacks overseen by the Trump administration, he’d expect that figure to increase if he redid his analysis in 2025. “The environmental externalities are higher, and production has gone up,” he says. “I think [the number] would be a lot higher.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/68bb11f3b8add802cd4e82f8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/science_powerplantsbill_GettyImages-114209816.jpg",N,,2025-09-09 13:05:52.057551

The concept is simple: It includes anything that you add to planet-warming emissions, ranging from the gas consumed by your car to the energy required to produce the food you eat. Reducing your carbon footprint means contributing less of these gases to the atmosphere.

But figuring out how to lower your carbon footprint is more complicated. That’s why several mobile tracking apps help people figure out which actions create the most emissions and how to avoid them.

Researchers have found that people often misjudge how their actions contribute to climate change, but can do better with more information. Apps are one way to learn more about emissions and build better habits.

So, I downloaded three popular ones. Here's how it went.

Calculating my own carbon footprint

Two of the apps started by calculating my personal footprint. And I’ll be honest. I thought I was going to look pretty good. I was wrong.

I take my climate impact seriously. I only eat meat on weekends, and it’s almost always low-impact options like chicken and turkey. I share my car (a plug-in hybrid) with my spouse, and we both work from home. I compost, I buy in bulk and I bring plastic containers to the restaurant for leftovers, so I produce very little trash. I mean, that’s a pretty standup environmental citizen, right?

Earth Hero and Pawprint both told me I emit around 17 tons (15 metric tons) of pollution every year. Earth Hero estimates the average American emits nearly 22 tons (20 metric tons), so I was below that. But my footprint is still three times higher than the average person globally.

The biggest culprits were the energy spent heating and cooling my old house along with twice-yearly flights I take to see my family 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away.

So, armed with guilt and panic-induced enthusiasm, I set out to reduce my impact, with the help of the apps.

The lifestyle recording apps

Earth Hero and Pawprint both started with a survey about eating, travel and spending that yielded the carbon footprint calculation. (I compared it with the EPA's calculator, and the results lined up.)

Then I scrolled through actions that could reduce my footprint. Pawprint assigns values to each action with the help of a climate impact consulting group. Earth Hero says it relies on volunteer scientists to research values for each action based on scientific data. Most of Earth Hero's actions came with points to “level up,” but actions that can't be easily quantified (like, “join a green team at work,”) didn't impact my score.

Some were easy (wash clothes in cold water) and some were ambitious (install rooftop solar energy). Earth Hero allowed me to mark ones that went on my list of goals. Pawprint incentivized doing small actions repeatedly to build my list of habits, which reduced my calculated footprint.

Pawprint gave me “Pawpoints” that I could redeem for investments into climate causes. Earth Hero’s actions reduced my emissions score and leveled up my profile, which appealed to my competitive nature.

Earth Hero CEO Ben Gerhold said the average person who signs up for the app — which has 150,000 users — reduces their calculated annual emissions score by one ton.

I kept this up for two weeks. As my enthusiasm waned, so did my participation. The self reporting made for a personalized experience and set of goals, but I didn't want to keep opening Pawprint every time I skipped a shower or ate a vegan meal. I stopped opening Earth Hero too, because after the easy stuff, I was left with pretty lofty goals, such as installing a water heater. That is on my list, but it's not a quick task.

The passive one that monitors spending

The third app I downloaded, called Commons, didn't require the same daily commitment.

The app, which monitors credit cards, generated weekly reports on what I'm buying. It didn't require ongoing inputs.

After getting over nervousness about sharing credit card data, I was flooded with insights. It listed every purchase in reverse chronological order and provided a rough estimate of its carbon impact, encouraging less spending in general and more sustainable purchases.

I got rewards when I bought from a sustainable brand, which I could then redeem for gift cards. The weekly report gave me kudos for spending less on gas and for no-purchase streaks for brands that it has given poor climate ratings.

It also encourages spending goals. This month's challenge, for example, is to buy secondhand, and I get extra rewards if I, with the 1,800 others who accepted the challenge, collectively reach our target.

Their calculations can be based on broad formulas. For example, my grocery bill is based how much I bought and not what I bought, so the $10 I spent on tofu counted the same as if I'd bought beef.

Beyond the carbon tracking

Commons' founder, Sanchali Pal, acknowledged the carbon footprint measurements are blunt. She said monitoring purchases is meant to get users to vote with their dollars and have a larger collective impact.

“A few individuals offsetting their footprint is great, but it’s not going to shift systems,” she said. “This idea of being able to send the signal to companies to shift their behavior was a lot more powerful.”

Many of the actions in Earth Hero's app were also about collective action. I'd get points if I wrote to my political representative or signed a petition. Gerhold said those kinds of actions are going to have a ""bigger ripple effect and just go beyond a niche app.”

After using the apps, I don't have a dramatically lower carbon footprint score to report, partly because life changes take longer than two weeks.

Still, I’m inspired to see how small I can make my footprint. I did book a more climate-friendly Christmas trip to see my family with a mixed plane and train itinerary, rather than flying the whole way. I am also planning home energy upgrades.

Might as well keep chipping away and see how far I get.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/09/PDTN/86057558007-ap-25252089532161.jpg?crop=5929,3336,x0,y592&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-09 13:05:34.728204

Buses across America will soon be rolling out once again stamped ‘Made in the North Country’ by Plattsburgh’s powerhouse workforce.
On behalf of our community, we warmly welcome Micro Bird to the Town of Plattsburgh.” TDC President and CEO Danielle King said, “TDC is thrilled to celebrate the official grand opening of Micro Bird in Plattsburgh.","Governor Kathy Hochul today joined local leaders and company executives to cut the ribbon on Micro Bird’s new U.S. manufacturing facility in Plattsburgh, Clinton County. Micro Bird — a joint venture between Blue Bird Corporation and Girardin, the largest manufacturer of small school buses in North America — has officially launched operations at the former Nova Bus facility on Banker Road, which the company repurposed following Nova Bus’s planned exit from Plattsburgh.

“Today’s grand opening celebration marks a new chapter for Plattsburgh,” Governor Hochul said. “We are proud to welcome Micro Bird to the North Country, where the company is tapping into our skilled workforce, thriving transportation cluster, and major regional investments. This new facility strengthens the local economy, creates good jobs, and builds a brighter future for the region and all of New York.”

The new facility, which will build both electric and non-electric small and mid-sized school and commercial buses, represents a $38 million investment in capital expenses and training and will create 350 full-time jobs over five years. Empire State Development is supporting the project with up to $9.825 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits and a $2.5 million capital grant, recommended by the North Country Regional Economic Development Council. Additionally, the New York Power Authority (NYPA) awarded Micro Bird a 640-kilowatt low-cost power allocation under the ReCharge NY program to support the project in March. ReCharge NY is strengthening New York State’s economy by encouraging companies to retain and create jobs, while sparking capital investment throughout the state.

Governor Hochul personally ensured a strong future for the Banker Road site, engaging directly with the Volvo Group — the parent company of Nova Bus — and directing Empire State Development to spearhead efforts to secure a new occupant. That effort culminated today with the ribbon-cutting ceremony marking a new chapter for the facility and the community.

Micro Bird President and CEO Eric Boulé said, “This grand opening is a proud moment for our entire team. With our new facility, we are doubling our production capacity and bringing high-quality, long-lasting buses closer to our U.S. customers. Plattsburgh was the perfect choice — offering a skilled workforce, proximity to major markets, and a strong manufacturing ecosystem. We are deeply grateful to our employees and to the unwavering support from New York State and local partners. We look forward to contributing to the region’s growth and success for many years to come.”

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “Today’s ribbon cutting for Micro Bird’s new facility in Clinton County marks an exciting milestone that will strengthen New York’s transportation manufacturing sector and provide good jobs for the region’s skilled workforce. This project would not have been possible without Governor Hochul’s direct involvement, and its success is a win for the North Country and all of New York State.”

New York Power Authority President & CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Micro Bird’s decision to establish their new manufacturing facility in Plattsburgh underscores the importance of reliable and affordable energy in economic growth. By leveraging low-cost power through the ReCharge NY program, NYPA is driving large-scale investment and supporting jobs in communities throughout New York. Micro Bird’s new facility represents a significant step forward for North Country manufacturing, and I look forward to seeing its positive impact on the region and the state’s clean transportation sector.”

Senator Charles Schumer said, “Micro Bird is officially open for business in Plattsburgh! Buses across America will soon be rolling out once again stamped ‘Made in the North Country’ by Plattsburgh’s powerhouse workforce. When I heard about the closure of the former Nova Bus factory, which was the beating heart of this community, I immediately called Volvo’s top brass to urge them to do the right thing and find a new manufacturer to take over this plant. Micro Bird’s leaders have shown they care about this community and continuing its manufacturing legacy by preserving hundreds of good-paying jobs here in Clinton County. I am thankful for the North Country Chamber of Commerce and Governor Hochul who formed a fantastic team in helping land this investment so Plattsburgh can continue to lead the nation in transportation manufacturing.”

Clinton County Legislature Chairman Mark Henry said, “Micro Bird’s grand opening is an exciting milestone for Clinton County. Their decision to invest here underscores the strength of our workforce, the value of our location, and the supportive business climate we have built. We are proud to welcome Micro Bird and look forward to the good jobs, economic growth, and strong partnerships that will come from their presence in our community.”

Plattsburgh Town Supervisor Michael S. Cashman said, “Moments like today don’t happen by accident, they happen because people come together with a shared commitment to building opportunity. I am proud to have played a role alongside so many dedicated leaders in helping Micro Bird find a home here in Plattsburgh. This expansion honors the strength of our workforce, supports working families, and reinforces the North Country’s reputation as a place where innovation and community thrive side by side. On behalf of our community, we warmly welcome Micro Bird to the Town of Plattsburgh.”

TDC President and CEO Danielle King said, “TDC is thrilled to celebrate the official grand opening of Micro Bird in Plattsburgh. Their locations in the Banker Road and Air Industrial parks are creating opportunities and adding excitement and energy into our manufacturing community. TDC is proud to be part of the team welcoming them, and we look forward to working together and watching them grow in the region.”

North Country Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Garry Douglas said, “Replacing an exiting company with a like manufacturer is almost never accomplished. That's what makes this success so extremely satisfying, guaranteeing that buses made by a skilled workforce in Plattsburgh will continue to roll across the country. I can't thank the local team the Chamber convened enough for their collaboration and commitment including the Clinton County IDA, TDC and the Town of Plattsburgh, as well as U.S. Senator Charles Schumer who responded strongly when called upon. But most of all Governor Kathy Hochul who was our economic development rock star every step of the way! It wasn't just her team that worked with us. She engaged very personally in outreach, advocacy and providing the state support needed. She got how important this was. Onward and upward and on the bus!”

Clinton County Industrial Development Agency Executive Director Molly Ryan said, “Micro Bird’s grand opening is a powerful example of the impact that strategic investment and strong partnerships can have in Clinton County. At the IDA, our mission is to create the conditions where businesses like Micro Bird can succeed, providing stability for our workforce and ensuring that good jobs remain here in our community. We are proud to have supported this project and look forward to seeing the company thrive here for years to come.”

Today’s ribbon-cutting celebrates the seamless transition from Nova Bus to Micro Bird, ensuring that hundreds of employees can continue building careers in advanced transportation manufacturing while strengthening the region’s role in the clean energy economy.

In 2024 the nation’s leading economic development and site selector trade publication Business Facilities Magazine awarded ESD the “Deal of the Year” Impact Award for the Micro Bird project, recognizing the significant positive economic impact it will have on the Plattsburgh community. The prestigious award was shared by ESD with its critical local partners: Clinton County Industrial Development Agency, North Country Chamber of Commerce, North Country REDC and the Town of Plattsburgh.

It’s unequivocal: Carbon pollution endangers health and welfare. Scientists agree that the

In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged that danger. That’s when the EPA issued the determination we know today as the “Endangerment Finding.” Issued in response to the 2007 Supreme Court case Massachusetts v. EPA, the Endangerment Finding unambiguously declared that the air pollutants emitted whenever oil and gas are burned endanger public health and welfare. And not just for those affected directly today, but for future generations who will grapple with the fallout from an overheating planet. The finding was an explicit acknowledgment that our government is bound by its duty to protect communities from the devastating consequences of climate-damaging pollution under the Clean Air Act.

This groundbreaking conclusion of the Endangerment Finding gave the EPA the legal authority to regulate dangerous, climate-warming emissions from cars and trucks, factories, and power plants. It is the assessment that has allowed us to vigorously push back against the hazardous pollution posing the existential threat of climate change.

Now, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is to rescind the Endangerment Finding, despite its solid backing by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence. This action imperils the health and safety of our families, who will inevitably face both acute and chronic disease and illness caused by breathing dirty air. It also jeopardizes the future of a planet on which climate change will make life increasingly untenable. Repealing the Endangerment Finding both sets us back from our fundamental obligation to protect health and impedes the urgent action we need to address climate change.

CLF is urging New England states to move swiftly to shield our region from the Trump EPA’s short-sighted and reckless decision to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

The Endangerment Finding was born in New England, as was the basis for the legal standing in the case that prompted the finding. And it is here where it has the potential to live on.

Our state governments can take immediate and decisive action to counterbalance the regulatory power ceded by the rescinding of the Endangerment Finding. By adhering to, and even strengthening, laws that mandate cuts in climate-damaging emissions, New England states will protect residents from the direct scourge of toxic air. They also will demonstrate an unswerving commitment to meeting those mandates for the next generation.

Clean Energy Offers the Potential for Jobs and Economic Growth

There is also an economic benefit to New England’s commitment to cutting carbon pollution in the face of EPA inaction. If states step up regulation of the power, building, and transportation sectors, they will drive increased investment in renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy. These sectors bring jobs. In 2023, according to a Department of Energy report, record investments in clean energy manufacturing resulted in a 142,000-job increase in clean energy employment nationwide. In New England alone, there are at least 131,000 clean energy jobs. In Massachusetts in 2024, there were 115,000 direct workers in the clean energy sector. Consider how many more jobs could be created if New England states were to double down on clean technologies.

New England Can Lead the Way, Even Without the EPA Endangerment Finding — Again

New England is certainly not the largest geographic region, but historically, it has punched above its weight. In the Clean Air Act case leading to the 2009 Endangerment Finding, New England reaffirmed its ability to challenge federal policy. The ruling confirmed that states have a special legal standing to sue the federal government over environmental harm like air pollution. Since then, we’ve stood at the forefront of climate action.

CLF has led that fight. We have worked to pass state laws that require deep cuts in carbon pollution. We have also developed innovative instruments, such as the groundbreaking Climate Superfund Act in Vermont, which aims to ensure that fossil fuel companies bear the costs of damage resulting from extreme weather caused by climate change. It is our sheer determination to uphold our values, combined with our practicality and refusal to be bullied, that has led to the high quality of life we enjoy in New England. CLF is going to continue to push New England forward, so we may continue our role as a beacon for other states and regions bamboozled off the path of clean energy.

Let there be no doubt, carbon pollution and climate change are a national and global problem. Indeed, state action alone cannot substitute for robust federal regulation. However, in this moment in which the federal government has abdicated all responsibility, state action can make a substantial difference. The states know what needs to be done to make this clean energy transition, and now, they need to double down on doing it.",https://www.clf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-3.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:03:35.363368
,American Energy,2025-09-09 15:52:44+00:00,dailycaller.com,EXCLUSIVE: Trump Admin Unshackling Permitting Constraints To Unleash American ...,Audrey Streb,,,,,https://dailycaller.com/2025/09/09/exclusive-trump-admin-moving-to-unshackle-permitting-constraints-to-unleash-american-energy-dominance/,"The Trump administration on Tuesday released new guidance on pre construction permitting, citing the need for new power generation as American energy demand accelerates with the rise of power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.
The shift would allow companies to get much-needed power on the grid sooner while still safeguarding the environment, several industry insiders told the Daily Caller News Foundation.
“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” EPA Administrator Zeldin said Tuesday.
The agency already moved to withdraw a proposed Biden-era NSR rule earlier in 2025 as it continued to cut down on regulations the energy industry considered to be burdensome.
“Delivering on what manufacturers have asked for, this guidance will drive infrastructure development by streamlining permitting reform for all energy sources so we can unleash American energy dominance critical for our industry to compete and succeed.”","The Trump administration on Tuesday released new guidance on pre construction permitting, citing the need for new power generation as American energy demand accelerates with the rise of power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its intent to revise the definition of “begin actual construction” for New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting so that companies can build or update non-emitting sections of power plants and industrial facilities before obtaining a Clean Air Act (CAA) construction permit. The shift would allow companies to get much-needed power on the grid sooner while still safeguarding the environment, several industry insiders told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” EPA Administrator Zeldin said Tuesday. “We are continuing to fix this broken system. Today’s guidance is another step to allow the build out of essential power generation, data centers, and manufacturing projects that will bring about America’s Golden Age.” (RELATED: Trump Admin Sounds Alarm Over Green Tech Climate Zealots Are Counting On)

During the first Trump administration, the EPA released similar draft guidance as the increase in CAA regulations has dialed up the difficulty of obtaining necessary permits, EPA Assistant Administrator of the Office of Air and Radiation Aaron Szabo told the DCNF. The agency already moved to withdraw a proposed Biden-era NSR rule earlier in 2025 as it continued to cut down on regulations the energy industry considered to be burdensome.

“We have many more permitting reforms that are coming… they’re big on their own, but also, when you add them up, are going to fundamentally change air permitting in this country so that we are able to build again,” Szabo told the DCNF. Szabo noted that companies are unable to begin constructing or modifying needed energy infrastructure without a CAA permit and that this change would allow developers to assemble necessary — yet emissions-free — portions of needed energy facilities.

The EPA has previously stated that it is “committed to increasing certainty in the permitting process that is crucial to securing power demand for data centers and related facilities.”

“To provide greater clarity on construction activities permissible under the Clean Air Act prior to obtaining an NSR permit, EPA is proposing new guidance and intends to propose and finalize a rule in 2026 that would revise the definition of ‘begin actual construction’ in EPA’s NSR regulations,” the EPA said Tuesday.

Though this might put companies at risk as they could build power plant foundations and eventually have a CAA permit denied by a state or local entity, several industry insiders told the DNCF that they celebrate the move as they expect it to speed up energy infrastructure projects in America’s shifting power landscape.

“The EPA’s action will help unlock the construction of the energy infrastructure, data centers, and advanced manufacturing facilities our economy needs to compete in the global marketplace,” Danny Seiden, president and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry, told the DCNF. “By streamlining permitting without compromising environmental safeguards, this guidance strikes the right balance between growth and responsibility, and it sends a strong signal that the U.S. is serious about becoming the world leader in innovation.”

Seiden told the DCNF he’s noticed a shift in industry concerns, with the top question in business meetings worldwide now being, “how are we going to generate the power we need?”

The anticipated uptick in domestic manufacturing as well as the rise in AI data centers are driving up American energy demand while aging energy infrastructure chokes supply. Former President Joe Biden’s green energy transition push and crackdown on conventional power sources like coal, oil and gas have strained America’s power grid, several energy experts and grid watchdogs have long cautioned.

President Donald Trump campaigned against what he terms the “green new scam” and has made several moves to unlock more of America’s energy potential while sounding the alarm over an impending energy crisis. Notably, the Department of Energy (DOE) released a report on American grid reliability on July 7, warning that blackouts will increase by a factor of 100 by 2030 if the U.S. continues to retire power plants without adequately replacing them.

“This administration has a sense of urgency that rivals our own,” said Fermi America Co-Founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer. “President Trump understands that thinking and acting like entrepreneurs is the only way to ensure that America wins again, and I applaud the EPA on this significant milestone towards that end.”

Zeldin has made several deregulatory moves since taking the helm of the EPA under Trump, seeking to protect human health and the environment while also bolstering the American energy sector.

“Championing the needs of manufacturers, the EPA’s new guidance on New Source Review brings speed and certainty to a vital preconstruction permitting process,” National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons told the DCNF. “Delivering on what manufacturers have asked for, this guidance will drive infrastructure development by streamlining permitting reform for all energy sources so we can unleash American energy dominance critical for our industry to compete and succeed.”","https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2194254243-1-scaled-e1757412134578.jpg",N,,2025-09-09 12:08:30.339492

From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program.
“The problem is we had a lot of client cancellations,” said Rouse, who today serves as Energy Savers’ executive director.
But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.
In the last 11 months, 26% of Energy Savers’ referrals have come from the Duke Customer Assistance Program, according to Rausch.","Talia Boyd was spending over $300 a month to keep her home just outside Asheville, North Carolina, cool this summer. It was an enormous sum for the single-wide trailer she shares with her baby daughter and teenage son.

“We constantly kept ceiling fans going, and I had to get AC units,” she said — multiple ones that ran 24/7 to replace the cold air seeping out from gaps around the windows.

But now, the air leaks have been sealed, a door has been replaced, and a new heat pump has been installed — all at no cost to Boyd. Her monthly utility bill from Duke Energy has been cut in half, she said.

The improvements are thanks to Energy Savers Network, a small nonprofit that serves Buncombe County, where Boyd lives, along with neighboring counties Henderson, Haywood, and Madison.

“They really came out and they helped,” said Boyd, who works in home health care. “They talked. They took measurements. They walked through the whole trailer. I really appreciate the help, and I would love to spread the word.”

Boyd’s home is among the roughly 1,400 that Energy Savers Network has assisted with weatherization since its inception in late 2016. Across the state in the same time frame, thousands of other households have received similar services, mostly from community action agencies deploying federal dollars.

But Boyd’s story is somewhat unique. She’s in a smaller subset of people who’ve benefited from a Duke initiative meant not just to aid the energy burdened in times of crisis, but to permanently reduce their electricity use through home efficiency improvements.

And with politicians at the state and national levels turning against the clean energy transition in low-income communities and elsewhere, Boyd’s experience is rare good news that advocates hope can continue to be replicated.

From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency

Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program. Part of a side deal the utility struck in 2023 to lessen the blow of its rate hikes, the program offers a monthly credit of up to $42 on bills for households at or below 150% of the federal poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four.

In 2024, Duke began automatically providing the credit to any customers who’d benefited in the prior year from one of two buckets of federal aid: the Crisis Intervention Program, designed to prevent or reverse life-threatening emergencies like utility shutoffs, or the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, which offers one-time payments to help households with heating bills.

North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services manages the two funds and has a data-sharing agreement with Duke, which then enrolls customers in its program — a process that has minimized administrative expenses such as vetting participants for eligibility.

And though in its first year the bill assistance benefited less than half the number of households forecast, experts say that’s because funding for the two buckets of federal aid dropped, not because the need isn’t great. Advocates remain bullish about the prospect for Duke to serve 100,000 customers or more annually.

Totaling over $500 for a year, the bill credit alone is vital for families struggling to make ends meet, aid groups say.

But Boyd’s case demonstrates the full potential of the Customer Assistance Program: Virtually every household receiving help gets referred to a local entity that can assess homes and perform free efficiency upgrades, reducing energy burdens beyond the 12 months of financial aid.

""I’m very impressed with Duke""

The brainchild and passion project of former financial and utility consultant Brad Rouse, Energy Savers has undergone a few iterations over its nine years of existence. Its throughline is providing energy-efficiency retrofits, usually in a day’s time, via a team of volunteers guided by a professional.

When everything is running smoothly, that means the group can perform upgrades — such as adding insulation and sealing air leaks — for at least three homes a week, according to Rouse. But in its early years, Energy Savers sometimes struggled to meet that mark.

“The problem is we had a lot of client cancellations,” said Rouse, who today serves as Energy Savers’ executive director. If they were last-minute, the group didn’t always have a backup client ready to take advantage of assembled volunteers and staff. In that case, Rouse said, “we lose the day.”

But now, the organization has almost eliminated that problem. “The Duke Customer Assistance referral is one big reason why,” he said.

That’s because the utility sends so many referrals that it’s easier to find clients who will be ready by the time the Energy Savers team arrives, reducing the likelihood of cancellations. And when a client does fall through, there’s a waiting list ready to be tapped.

The group identifies households in need through multiple channels, including farmers markets, community events, and word of mouth. But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.

“We send out a bulk mailing to [potential clients] first and then we try to follow up with phone calls to get them scheduled,” Rausch said.

Boyd, for instance, first got help paying her utility bills through Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry, which accessed one of the federal crisis assistance funds for her. She was soon enrolled in Duke’s $42 bill-credit program and then referred to Energy Savers. “They popped up at my doorstep,” Boyd said.

In the last 11 months, 26% of Energy Savers’ referrals have come from the Duke Customer Assistance Program, according to Rausch. So far, 36 of those referred families have made it through the weatherization process.

“I'm very impressed with Duke at this point,” Rausch said. The utility, which funds the majority of the services provided by Energy Savers, always makes sure the group gets reimbursed, she said. “We've never been stuck with the bill.”

To be sure, Duke and advocates for low-income customers are still working out kinks in the bill-credit scheme. One challenge is waning funding for the two federal crisis assistance initiatives that are used to automatically enroll individuals in the Customer Assistance Program. Another hurdle is connecting the dots for recipients, who often don’t realize they’re getting the bill credit or that they’re getting referred to groups like Energy Savers.

Most of all, advocates are mindful that the Customer Assistance Program is in the middle of a three-year pilot phase, and they want to extend it one way or another — as a feature of Duke’s next three-year rate increase, as a condition of the merger of the company’s two North Carolina utilities, or as part of some other case before state regulators.

Boyd knows as well as advocates that the need for long-lasting energy savings is substantial. She’s now trying to get help for her 93-year-old Aunt Viola, whose electricity bill tops $400 a month.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aqyz9Nov9u0JTlLqWAjkLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/6eb56d174159d273972bf0e7e50c1505,N,,2025-09-09 16:03:41.196886

Knowing the importance of project developers in bootstrapping new industries, I was pleasantly surprised to find one specializing in thermal energy storage.

I have often witnessed in my consulting work the vital role played by project developers in building sophisticated economic ecosystems for such diverse fields as carbon capture and storage and wind and solar farm construction.

The emergence of a developer specializing in TES is a good sign, as it indicates that the economic benefits of storing energy as heat are sufficiently compelling to attract smart intermediaries into the TES space.

I spoke with Ted Kniesche, the CEO and co-founder of South Carolina-based TES project developer startup Zero Industrial, about his company’s role in bootstrapping a new technology and what he is seeing in the TES market right now.

He started by telling me that if an industrial consumer of heat is located in a region with abundant renewable energy resources, it is a sure bet that at certain times of day, electrons are in such abundance that electricity is nearly free.

MORE FOR YOU

So much solar energy is generated during midday in sunny California, for example, that electricity prices sometimes turn negative and renewable generation plants are asked not to send energy to the grid. This process is termed “curtailment” in the parlance of grid operators.

If these low- or zero-cost electrons can be converted into heat for later industrial use, manufacturers stand to save a lot of money on fuel. Reduced fuel cost was one main driver in PepsiCo’s decision to use Kraftblock’s batteries in its snack foods plants in the Netherlands, scheduled to go live in just a few weeks.

Zero Industrial identifies markets which offer such energy arbitrage opportunities by analyzing inputs such as facility locations, electricity pricing, available incentives, substation capacities and nearby process heat users that could benefit from TES.

Many operating managers are too focused on day-to-day concerns to keep up with engineering innovations outside their field, so project developers walk clients through a cost-benefit analysis of implementing a new technology.

Kniesche and his team meet with a prospective customer’s management to explain how TES systems operate. Depending on the manufacturer’s interest after reviewing the initial technical and economic analysis, Kniesche and his team then conduct detailed engineering studies, pull building permits, and help arrange project financing.

Kniesche believes that cost reduction, rather than decarbonization, is the primary driver for TES adoption in the North American market. He points out that while most industrial customers are not regulated to reduce CO2, all customers want to cut costs. Another selling point is the reduction of combustion emissions (e.g., nitrogen and sulfur oxides and small particulate matter) that often burden industrial operations in dense urban settings.

I asked Kniesche how recent changes in the regulatory environment have affected the TES market. He told me that some of the rules passed to placate manufacturers after the virtual repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act have been extraordinarily positive for TES projects. In addition to maintaining investment and manufacturing tax credits, the Trump administration’s recent regulation changes have reinstated 100% first-year depreciation—allowing companies to access tax equity financing for capital projects. Tax equity financing is one of the drivers that led to the boom in renewable energy installations, so it isn’t a stretch to imagine it will benefit the TES market as well.

Kniesche and his team’s emergence in this space has reaffirmed my recent interest in thermal energy storage by confirming the wealth of opportunities that exist to use TES to improve industrial efficiency while reducing carbon emissions.

While the company has not officially announced an exit from battery manufacturing, its actions—ranging from supply chain reallocation to a heightened focus on alternative EV technologies—signal a recalibration of priorities. For investors, this pivot raises critical questions about the future of the EV supply chain and where the next wave of innovation and profitability might emerge.

The Rationale Behind Bosch's Strategic Shift

Bosch's decision to shift engineering projects in the U.S. to China and Germany, coupled with the elimination of product development roles in North America, underscores a broader effort to consolidate operations and enhance competitiveness. This restructuring aligns with industry-wide challenges in battery manufacturing, including the exorbitant capital costs of establishing and scaling production facilities. According to a report by

Market Research, battery production remains a capital-intensive endeavor, with firms like LG Chem and Panasonic dominating due to their ability to sustain long-term R&D and operational investments. Bosch, a stalwart in automotive components but not a traditional battery leader, appears to be retreating from direct manufacturing to focus on areas where its expertise can yield higher returns.

Supply Chain Reallocation and Industry Dynamics

The automotive supply chain is undergoing a seismic shift as companies adapt to the demands of electrification. Bosch's reallocation of resources mirrors a trend observed across the sector: the prioritization of software-driven solutions and digital integration over traditional hardware manufacturing. At CES 2025, Bosch showcased innovations like InFly Battery Laser Welding and Smart Battery Formation, which leverage AI to optimize production efficiency and reduce failure rates. These tools not only highlight Bosch's commitment to digital transformation but also signal a strategic pivot toward enabling technologies rather than end-to-end manufacturing.

This shift has implications for the EV supply chain. As Bosch refocuses on digital solutions, suppliers specializing in battery production—particularly in regions like Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe—may fill the gap. Central Europe, however, is emerging as a hub for localized battery management system (BMS) production, driven by EU regulations mandating 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035. Bosch's investments in AI-driven BMS and cybersecurity-focused designs position it to capitalize on this regional shift, even as it steps back from raw battery cell production.

Investment Opportunities in Alternative EV Technologies

Bosch's strategic reallocation opens doors for investors to explore alternative EV technologies where the company is doubling down. For instance, its advancements in silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors and gallium nitride (GaN) components are critical for improving the efficiency of electric drives and thermal management systems. These wide-bandgap semiconductors reduce energy losses and enable faster charging, aligning with the industry's push toward 800V architectures.

Moreover, Bosch's collaboration with Benteler on modular EV platforms and its development of cloud-based battery monitoring systems—such as Battery in the Cloud—underscore its pivot toward software-defined value chains. These services, which use AI to predict battery aging and optimize lifetimes, could become lucrative revenue streams as automakers seek to extend the durability of their EVs.

Financial Resilience and Market Positioning

Bosch's Q2 2025 financial results—revenue of €4.394 billion and an operating income of €519 million—demonstrate the company's ability to maintain profitability amid restructuring. This financial resilience allows Bosch to invest in high-potential areas like AI-driven manufacturing and alternative semiconductors without relying on external financing. For investors, the key takeaway is that Bosch's strategic reallocation is not a retreat from the EV market but a recalibration to focus on high-margin, technology-driven segments.

Conclusion: Navigating the EV Supply Chain's New Normal

Bosch's approach reflects a broader industry trend: the decoupling of hardware manufacturing from software and systems integration. While the company may not be exiting battery manufacturing entirely, its emphasis on digital tools and alternative technologies signals a shift in value creation. For investors, this presents opportunities in two areas:

1. Supply Chain Rebalancing: Supporting regional BMS producers and AI-driven manufacturing firms that align with Bosch's strategic focus.

2. Alternative EV Technologies: Targeting firms innovating in SiC/GaN semiconductors, cloud-based battery management, and modular EV platforms.

As the EV market matures, companies that can adapt their supply chains and R&D priorities to these dynamics—like Bosch—are likely to outperform peers clinging to legacy models. The question for investors is not whether Bosch is exiting battery manufacturing, but where it will lead the next wave of innovation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-09 17:03:29.016351

This is the first time the program has opened for new applications under President Donald Trump. SWIFR was created by the Save Our Seas Act 2.0, a bipartisan bill passed in 2020, and first funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed by President Joe Biden in 2021.

The legislation allocated the program $55 million per year to spend from fiscal years 2022 through 2026, and Congress has occasionally supplemented that total.

Recipients for the latest round of SWIFR grants can expect to receive between $100,000 and $1.5 million for an individual award. The agency plans to make about 20 agreements in this round, totaling approximately $20 million. Proposed projects are expected to last three years, except in Alaska, where they can have up to five years.

Acceptable activities should incorporate concepts like source reduction, data collection, increased diversion rates or improvements to materials management infrastructure, per the EPA. Projects can address materials like organics, curbside recyclables, C&D waste, scrap tires and batteries.

The application period closes on Dec. 12. The EPA is planning to host an informational webinar on Oct. 7.

The agency last announced grantees for tribes and intertribal consortia in 2023. Funded projects included the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe building a food waste composting facility in New York, the Crow Tribe of Indians providing household collection of recyclables in Montana and Kawerak building a regional recycling center in Nome, Alaska.

Federal grant recipients have struggled with mixed messages from the Trump administration this year. The EPA has canceled hundreds of grants for a variety of projects, including waste and recycling, some over mentions of environmental justice. Issues with the U.S. Treasury’s reimbursement system for grantees under contract and declining support staff also have frustrated funding recipients.

Nevertheless, EPA has made more direct nods to waste initiatives in recent weeks.

Dive Brief:

In one of the highest profile immigration raids of President Donald Trump’s second term, hundreds of federal agents arrested 475 workers at a construction site in Georgia, the Department of Justice announced Sept. 5.

Meanwhile, White House border czar Tom Homan told CNN’s State of the Union Sunday the administration will continue to ramp up raids on U.S. workplaces.

The Ellabell, Georgia, facility is the future home of a $4.3 billion electric vehicle battery facility co-owned by Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution. The vast majority of the arrested workers were South Korean, The New York Times reported.

Dive Insight:

The effort to find and deport immigrants present in the U.S. illegally has been a priority for the Trump administration. Once Immigration and Customs Enforcement was able to mobilize, the jobsite raids began.

It’s no secret construction employs many foreign-born workers, though it’s hard to know how many for certain. Some estimates place the total share of undocumented construction workers at about 23%.

As a result, the industry is feeling the impact of those ICE raids. Immigration enforcement has affected about one in three construction firms, according to a survey released Aug. 28 by the Associated General Contractors of America and the National Center for Construction Education and Research.

And contractors are desperate for labor; roughly nine in ten firms report having openings for craft construction workers. The lack of skilled workforce has been the largest cause of project delays, per the AGC survey.

Hyundai and LG invested $4.3 billion to establish the HL-GA Battery Company plant, with plans to begin production of EV batteries in early 2026, per the project website. Both of the owner firms are based in South Korea.

No Hyundai employees were arrested, the company said in a statement, and 47 LG employees were detained, according to The New York Times. Most of those arrested were employed by subcontractors.

In its statement, Hyundai said it had “zero tolerance” for those who do not follow the law and would expect the same of project partners.

“We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,” the statement said.

LG did not respond to Construction Dive’s request for comment by the time of publication.

Negotiations to return workers to South Korea moved quickly, Reuters reported. Three hundred detained workers will be processed, released and returned via a chartered plane, the country’s presidential office said on Sunday.

The megaproject is one example of an onshoring push to benefit investments by foreign companies on U.S. soil. But Homan promised similar enforcement action would continue.

“No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart,” Homan said on CNN’s State of the Union. “They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees. They drive wages down.”

On Sunday, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to call on foreign companies to continue to plan projects in the U.S., but to do so within the law.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/8Q0X7MY_wA8xdPkGEYA2ghrer45nE20Kd8_H7IhneXY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yNTA5MDVTYXZhbm5haDFfMC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-09 12:09:55.950828

In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world—especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars—especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don't have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today's electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are ""not meaningful"" contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions—it also misses an opportunity to make the nation's electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation's power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built—and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don't need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren't charging.

A virtuous—or vicious—cycle

Our analysis reveals that what's good for climate in the transportation sector—eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes—is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can't last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can't single-handedly stop this transition—it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn't just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors—power generation and transportation—while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2025/trump-reversed-policie.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:09:59.645898

These inefficiencies highlight the need to update the who, what, and when of judicial review to balance community input, investment certainty, and process efficiency.
A contributing factor to this litigation may be the lack of transparency within the existing federal permitting process.
Digitizing the permitting process has been discussed as one way to increase transparency and efficiency throughout multiple Congresses and Administrations.
Overdue reforms like digitizing the process will help us enhance efficiency and transparency for project proponents, government agencies, and the general public leading to better outcomes.","As energy-hungry project developers across the nation drive unprecedented demand growth for electricity, critical minerals, and all the supporting infrastructure, the permitting reform conversation has once again moved to center stage in Washington D.C. While some elements from legislative efforts of the last Congress remain sticky, others have enjoyed broad support from industry and Hill players alike – in particular, the need to increase transparency and efficiency to help modernize a byzantine and often inaccessible permitting process.

The federal environmental review process, while well intentioned, has long lacked clarity for both project developers and local stakeholders. As a direct result, project timelines and costs have increased significantly. These delays have made it difficult to build just about anything in America, likely aiding the growing advantages of global competitors who don’t face similar constraints. During a period where we expect electricity load growth to increase by a factor of five, there is broad consensus that reforms aren’t optional – they’re a dire need.

Litigation has long been a major hurdle for energy projects, with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) lawsuits delaying both fossil fuel and clean energy project implementation by 3.9 years on average. While affected stakeholders should have the ability to express concerns or litigate a project if necessary, the vast majority of cases are not filed by community leaders themselves and agencies ultimately win 71 percent of these lawsuits defending their decisions. These inefficiencies highlight the need to update the who, what, and when of judicial review to balance community input, investment certainty, and process efficiency.

A contributing factor to this litigation may be the lack of transparency within the existing federal permitting process. Projects often require approvals from different federal agencies that may not have clear, unified processes for reviews, and there are limited signals to stakeholders on when and how to engage. In addition, many agencies still use paper-based systems with no requirement to bring the process online and increase accessibility. Integrating robust public involvement from the earliest stages can help build trust and identify areas of conflict before they lead to delays or litigation.

Digitizing the permitting process has been discussed as one way to increase transparency and efficiency throughout multiple Congresses and Administrations. The recent bipartisan introduction of the ePermit Act is the most significant step in creating the kind of cohesive system across the federal government that would speed up reviews, enhance accessibility, provide project transparency, and in result, save taxpayer dollars. The ePermit Act introduced in the House by Representatives by Reps. Johnson (SD) and Peters (CA), requires the creation of data standards, a universal permitting taxonomy, and an interoperable digital permitting portal.

Would something as noncontroversial as migrating permitting online move us towards a more efficient process? Multiple states have already modernized their own systems and seen meaningful benefits. For example, estimates show that the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s digital portal creation contributed to a 91% decline in permitting timeframes and $150 million in annual economic benefits. In addition, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), who would oversee implementation, recently completed a study required by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023 looking at the technical needs and benefits of a digitalized permitting process. Many key takeaways from CEQ’s study were directly incorporated into the ePermit Act.

There is broad consensus that America’s permitting system is outdated, putting our energy and infrastructure security at risk. Overdue reforms like digitizing the process will help us enhance efficiency and transparency for project proponents, government agencies, and the general public leading to better outcomes. While not a silver bullet on its own, pairing it with other commonsense updates to our permitting regime would enable America to once again build at rapid pace and scale. The ePermit Act can help uphold the rigorous environmental standards Americans in communities across the nation rely on, while leveraging new technologies to meet 21st century challenges.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-490753474-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 14:03:14.355339

It stipulated that recipients under these programs could use the funds to plug orphan wells; identify and prioritize orphan wells and well sites; measure air emissions and ground contamination from wells; identify and address disproportionate burdens on disadvantaged communities; remediate and reclaim orphan well sites and contaminated soil; and restore native species and adjacent land.
However, in July, the OWPO issued revised guidance on administering the orphan wells program.
OWPO is still analyzing the role that the government could play in terms of carbon credits for plugging orphan wells.
Indeed, the benefits of orphan well reclamation could reverberate throughout the 30-plus states with orphan wells, furthering the opportunity and optimism that is being expressed about the effort.","The staggering number of orphan wells that exist throughout the U.S. today is well-known. A 2022 report produced by the U.S. Geological Survey documented a dataset containing the location and status of 117,672 unplugged orphan wells across 27 states.

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) estimates the number of undocumented orphaned wells to be between 310,000 and 800,000. That estimate may be low based on various reports by independent organizations. The issue isn’t merely the number of known and identified orphan wells. It is also the number of unknown wells that have yet to be officially identified and categorized.

Orphan wells pose a number of risks to the public and the oil and gas industry. They can emit methane and air toxins, contaminate ground water, pose a safety hazard to people and animals in their proximity and negatively impact property values. For industry, orphan wells can interfere with oil and gas operations, and their existence provides a reputational risk to the entire sector. For these reasons, both federal and state governments have established programs to identify and plug orphan wells.

In 2021, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $4.677 billion in orphaned well site plugging, remediation and restoration through allocations to three federal programs that it established: a federal program with $250 million for wells on federal lands and waters; a state program with $4.2 billion for wells on state and private lands; and a tribal program with $150 million for wells on tribal lands.

It stipulated that recipients under these programs could use the funds to plug orphan wells; identify and prioritize orphan wells and well sites; measure air emissions and ground contamination from wells; identify and address disproportionate burdens on disadvantaged communities; remediate and reclaim orphan well sites and contaminated soil; and restore native species and adjacent land.

It provided an additional $2 million for the IOGCC to use to administer the program. In 2023, the Secretary of the Interior established the Orphaned Wells Program Office (OWPO) to administer the federal program.

The same law also established the DOE CATALOG program, which directs the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its national labs, to work with IOGCC to develop a program focused on reducing the impacts of undocumented orphaned wells and provide $30 million to locate and characterize undocumented orphan wells.

Fears of cutbacks

After President Donald Trump returned to office in January, many federal programs were slowed or halted as the new administration analyzed opportunities through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to eliminate waste, inefficiency and redundancies. There was fear by states, federal and tribal officials, as well as the private sector, that the orphan wells program would be eliminated or severely cut back.

However, in July, the OWPO issued revised guidance on administering the orphan wells program. It expressed its desire to continue the program and provide ways to expedite well plugging by eliminating some “non-statutory requirements” such as requiring methane measurement before and after remediation and other environmental reviews and approvals as part of the process. Specifically, it has eliminated reviews to the program that would have been triggered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), while preserving comparable prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act.

In general, OWPO’s guidance is designed to give federal, state and tribal entities greater flexibility in administering the program. It allows states and other entities to continue to require methane measurement, ESA and NHPA reviews, but does not require them. It continues to support measures that protect aquifers and other water sources important to agriculture and local communities.

OWPO is still analyzing the role that the government could play in terms of carbon credits for plugging orphan wells. It still allows for the issuance and use of such credits, while the role and opportunities of carbon credits for the program are further evaluated.

Most importantly, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Trump administration as a whole have stated that the plugging of orphan wells is consistent with and beneficial to the nation’s energy dominance goals, with DOI calling the program “an important component of President Trump’s efforts to unleash American energy and address our National Energy Emergency.” This finding is grounded in the belief that well plugging benefits domestic production by reducing the social, community and physical risks of orphan wells.

OWPO’s guidance and administration statements have provided a renewed sense of optimism about the state of orphan well reclamation among federal, state and tribal entities seeking to utilize federal funds for well plugging and related activities. At the same time, questions remain around the DOE CATALOG program, which has not been active in recent months.

States step up

Underscoring the continued momentum to addressing orphan wells, in addition to seeking opportunities to utilize federal funds for well reclamation projects, states are taking their own initiatives through legislative and regulatory action to require well reclamation of inactive wells and adequate bonding assurance for reclamation.

For example, Texas passed a new law this year that mandates plugging and reporting requirements for oil, gas and injection wells, placing the authority under the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission of Texas. It requires wells inactive for 15 years to be plugged unless operators successfully apply for exemption under one of several exceptions.

Louisiana’s Gov. Jeff Landry signed an executive order this year that calls for state support for requiring financial assurance for orphaned and abandoned wells and directs the state’s Department of Energy and Natural Resources “to strategically and proactively address orphan wells in state waters.”

In New Mexico, the Oil Conservation Division is implementing several administrative actions addressing orphan wells, including requirements for methane capture, increased financial assurance and bonding reform, stricter reclamation standards and penalties for not plugging wells.

Additionally, Oklahoma’s legislature will likely be considering legislation in the coming year for new well plugging requirements and tiered financial assurance.

Finally, Utah is undergoing a rigorous rulemaking process to require performance bonds for well reclamation.

Common to the federal, state and tribal efforts for addressing orphan well identification and reclamation has been an emphasis on the needs and benefits of a well-trained workforce to perform the work needed to implement the programs. The federal government is emphasizing the job benefits that could result from this massive effort, and states and tribal entities are identifying opportunities to train future workers through traditional colleges and trade schools.

Indeed, the benefits of orphan well reclamation could reverberate throughout the 30-plus states with orphan wells, furthering the opportunity and optimism that is being expressed about the effort. Federal and state governments, supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and recent administrative actions, are accelerating orphan well reclamation efforts through funding, regulatory reform and workforce development, despite earlier concerns of program rollback under the Trump administration. There is a promising future for these remediation efforts.",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/09/belcher-new-opportunities-orphan-well-reclamation.jpg?itok=9towSkax,N,,2025-09-09 12:11:30.642273

The commission released its decision in an Aug. 25 notice.

The TCEQ temporarily rejected the facility's permit in January after Fort Bend County commissioners and residents filed motions asking the agency to reject the permit.

“Businesses have seen what is in the tax bill, and it will be helpful, but I think it’s still too early to tell what the impact will be in SC,” Lummus said.
The new law cements tax breaks from President Donald Trump's first term and expands provisions on company expenses and itemizations.
In April, Trump signed executive orders imposing a 10 percent tariff and ""reciprocal"" tariffs intended to correct trade imbalances on more than 90 countries.","LIBERTY — When Mark Peabody was looking to move his plastic manufacturing business from California, he looked at Texas, Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas before deciding on the Palmetto State for its manufacturing-friendly environment.

South Carolina’s laws, regulations and tax incentives were a major draw in a state where manufacturing employs 300,000 people and generates a more than $200 billion annual economic impact.

Nowhere is that happening more rapidly than in the Upstate, where nearly 38 percent of the region’s employment is in manufacturing or logistics support. Peabody’s operational costs here are a lot lower, he said, and he’s able to hire local workers around the region.

Peabody first opened his facility 30 minutes west of Greenville in 2022. Earlier this month, he announced the company is expanding its footprint — made possible, he said, by the Trump administration’s new tax bill branded as the “Working Families Tax Cut.”

Not every company can say the same.

Tariffs and a constantly evolving trade policy are still costing international businesses thousands to millions of dollars — and it’s being felt in South Carolina, home to many international manufacturing companies that export across the world, from BMW Manufacturing in Greer to Volvo in Charleston.

“Being so dependent on trade, the tariffs already have started and will continue to be a deterrent to being able to do business,” said John Lummus, CEO of Upstate SC Alliance, a public/private regional economic development organization.

When companies are making decisions they want certainty. But no one is sure what to expect next as the president’s policy evolves and tariffs are challenged in court.

“Businesses have seen what is in the tax bill, and it will be helpful, but I think it’s still too early to tell what the impact will be in SC,” Lummus said.

Federal policymakers are hoping those tax perks signed into law July 4 will help balance the equation for businesses feeling the pressure from the president’s tariffs, particularly in manufacturing.

There’s no doubt that failing to pass the bill would’ve been “a huge headwind” for manufacturers regardless of tariff policy, said Jason Pritchard, partner at GreerWalker tax practice.

South Carolina would’ve lost 86,000 jobs, $7.5 billion in employee wages and $15.2 billion in GDP, according to analysis from the National Association of Manufacturers.

The new law cements tax breaks from President Donald Trump's first term and expands provisions on company expenses and itemizations.

Companies can immediately deduct the cost of new manufacturing plants right away, and the law also has incentives for producing semiconductors here in the U.S. There are other popular deductions for domestic research and development, which small businesses can apply retroactively to tax years after Dec. 31, 2021.

“Generally speaking, for a domestic manufacturer whose raw materials all are sourced locally, I think this bill would be a net win for them,” Prichard said.

However, “if your business depends heavily on raw materials or partially finished goods coming from outside the U.S. — regardless of how good or bad the tax portion of this bill is — your costs and your margins are really getting squeezed,” he said.

When it became clear the bill would pass, Peabody decided it was time to double the plant’s manufacturing space and buy new equipment. Most of his materials are sourced domestically in the U.S.

The company is now under contract with a design firm to break ground in October, a $9.5 million expansion that will add 20 jobs.

But tariffs bring uncertainty. In April, Trump signed executive orders imposing a 10 percent tariff and ""reciprocal"" tariffs intended to correct trade imbalances on more than 90 countries. The Trump administration is also broadening tariffs on steel and aluminum to re-shore production.

The trade wars could cost major U.S. employers up to $82.3 billion, according to analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute, and has made many companies hesitate to expand their businesses or hire.

The American labor market keeps cooling alongside the economic fallout.

The U.S. added just a third of forecasted jobs in August — 22,000 jobs instead of an expected 76,500, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Sept. 5. The unemployment rate rose from 4.2 percent to 4.3 percent. The data is the first release under new labor bureau leadership after Trump fired the previous director for producing data that he called “a scam.”

GE Vernova, an international energy manufacturing company, has navigated rocky waters this year as tariffs and Trump’s executive order to withdraw from offshore wind leasing pummeled energy stocks in early 2025. GE Vernova has the largest gas turbine manufacturing plant globally located in Greenville.

The company now expects the negative impact of tariffs in 2025 to be at the lower end of $300 million to $400 million. Still, CEO Scott Strazik was optimistic on a conference call at the end of July, saying the company had a “productive” second quarter. He also cited ongoing gas power demand and higher turbine prices.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/23/223f3d87-d614-4040-aa42-63d96687a0b3/68b9d549cc53e.image.jpg?crop=1925%2C1010%2C62%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-09 13:06:20.834423

The surge in electricity demand is not inherently a problem.
The massive spike in demand for electricity, however, is rapidly driving up energy prices across the United States.
LOST IN TRANSPORTATION Meeting rising electricity demand will require expanding the transmission and distribution infrastructure that moves electricity from where it is generated to where consumers want to use it.
The resulting grid congestion raised consumers’ electricity bills in the United States by $11.5 billion in 2023.","The United States faces an energy crunch of historic proportions. After nearly 20 years of flat demand, electricity use is now growing at its fastest rate since World War II. The U.S. economy increasingly relies on electricity to heat and cool homes, to power businesses and factories, and to propel cars, trucks, and buses. New manufacturing facilities, such as those making semiconductors, and the data centers that undergird the country’s artificial intelligence ambitions consume unprecedented amounts of electricity. In total, over the next decade, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the independent regulator tasked with monitoring grid reliability, projects that national peak electricity demand will increase 18 percent from today’s levels—nearly the equivalent of adding the total current demand of California, New York, and Texas combined.

The surge in electricity demand is not inherently a problem. It reflects the technology-fueled progress that electrification can deliver. But rising demand is already starting to drive up electricity prices and push the grid to its limits. Without rapid action, consumers will pay more, businesses will be less competitive, and the country will risk losing its lead in technological innovation and advanced manufacturing.

Although the United States must build new power plants, these alone cannot produce enough electricity fast enough to meet skyrocketing demand. Another solution, however, is readily available: squeezing more out of the existing electric system. U.S. energy infrastructure has much more to give. On average, roughly half the electric infrastructure in the United States sits idle at any point in time. This is because the U.S. electric system was engineered for moments of intense demand—the rare episodes of extreme heat or cold when the need for electricity peaks—not for delivering power to consumers in the cheapest and most efficient way. What has resulted is a system full of inefficiencies and lost potential.

The technology to get more out of the system already exists. Batteries can store excess power, sensors can boost how much electricity moves across wires, and software can aggregate distributed energy sources in homes and buildings and make them work together like power plants. Utilities, energy companies, and grid operators need to shift their focus from maximizing energy output to prioritizing improvements that will lower prices and increase reliability for consumers. In the face of rising prices and mounting macroeconomic stress, policymakers and energy players need to meet the political moment by adopting simple, straightforward reforms to utilities and energy markets that will benefit both individual consumers and the broader economy.

FEELING THE HEAT

For decades, the United States enjoyed a relative energy advantage. Electricity prices for industrial users ran at roughly half those for European competitors, and American households and businesses benefited from the United States’ vast energy resources.

The massive spike in demand for electricity, however, is rapidly driving up energy prices across the United States. Retail electricity prices in 2025 have increased at nearly twice the rate of overall inflation. In the first half of the year, utilities requested or received approval for a record $29 billion in rate increases, which means consumers will face higher electricity bills in the coming years. PJM, the regional grid operator serving customers from Michigan to Virginia, announced that the 67 million Americans in its region would see their electricity bills rise by up to 20 to 30 percent next year. Consumers are already feeling the pain: in an April survey run by PowerLines, a consumer education nonprofit, two out of three Americans indicated that utility bills are a source of financial stress.

As prices are increasing, reliability is faltering. U.S. power markets are failing to hold enough spare power to prevent blackouts when demand surges, such as on very hot or cold days. This year, nine out of 13 power markets in the United States are expected to fall below a critical reliability threshold, which marks the level at which the supply of spare power is considered sufficient to avoid outages.

This combination of higher prices and lower reliability poses a direct threat to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. The global economy is entering an era in which a few new or rapidly growing high-tech industries, including AI, innovative energy technologies, and cutting-edge semiconductors, will drive economic growth. Leading the world in these sectors requires an electric system that can power them. China, the main U.S. competitor in many of these fields, has poured money into electricity generation as part of a long-term plan to power more of its economy with electricity.

The good news is that the United States added nearly 50 gigawatts of new power capacity in 2024, the highest amount in more than two decades. But even at this record pace, supply from new power generation alone cannot keep up with rising demand because of supply chain constraints and regulatory bottlenecks. New natural gas plants are being delayed until the 2030s because of a 50-month backlog for natural gas turbines, and new nuclear power plants can take more than a decade to get off the ground. Renewables are cheaper and faster to deploy, but securing the permits for large-scale facilities and transmission can take years. And the interconnection queue—the waiting line for power sources to get approval to connect to the grid—has swelled to 2,600 gigawatts, or twice the size of the current grid. Washington’s recent tax and spending law, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, also raises costs by curtailing federal incentives for new sources of renewable power.

FROM QUANTITY TO QUALITY

The United States can meet staggering demand, however, without technological moonshots, long time horizons, or hefty price tags. This is because even modest improvements in the use of the existing energy infrastructure can yield huge gains. A five percentage point boost in the use of the country’s existing electric infrastructure would unlock the electric equivalent of roughly 60 new natural gas power plants.

Although increasing the efficiency of the existing infrastructure may seem obvious, it is the opposite of how the system has been designed up to this point. In the twentieth century, with limited energy generation technologies and few ways to easily improve efficiency, the goal was to build as many new power plants as possible. Policymakers rewarded utilities, which have a regional monopoly over electricity and whose profits are determined by regulators, on the basis of how much new capital they deployed rather than how well the system performed. Over the past two decades, energy developers have also largely adopted an install-and-forget approach: maximizing upfront capital investments while ignoring the expense of ongoing servicing and maintenance.

The result is a system that is both underused and underperforming. Data from the Federal Reserve indicate that the percent of electricity generation resources in use on average has declined by ten percentage points over the last decade. Performance has deteriorated as well: outages increased by 60 percent from 2013 to 2023.

DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS

The electric system is underperforming because utilities and energy companies don’t get rewarded for making the existing system operate more efficiently or adopting new technologies that could render outdated systems obsolete. Instead, utilities are paid to figure out how to profit from building a new power plant, not how to adopt the cheapest, most efficient solution. But when policymakers change incentives and remove regulatory barriers for utilities and energy companies to adopt better technology, electric systems work better. Texas is an example of how to get this right.

Since 2021, electricity demand in Texas has grown nearly 20 percent because of record population growth, an influx of energy-intensive manufacturing, and the construction of new data centers. Peak energy demand in the state could double by the end of the decade.

Yet despite this growth, Texas is not facing an energy crisis. Electricity prices are falling, and grid reliability is increasing. Texas has chosen “all of the above” when it comes to strategies to boost electric capacity. This includes connecting new power plants to the grid quickly; installing batteries to store more of the resulting cheap, clean electricity and then releasing it to the grid when demand spikes; and requiring new large-scale electricity users to operate flexibly when connecting to the grid so that the system takes full advantage of its existing capacity without stretching beyond its breaking point. Texas is projected to have the lowest wholesale electricity prices of any market in the country in 2025, and the state has had no blackouts so far this summer.

In Texas, electricity prices are falling and grid reliability is increasing.

Unlike other operators that force new power generators to wait years before they can plug into the grid, Texas’s grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, uses a “connect and manage” model that connects new plants to the grid and then handles congestion by managing their operations in real time. As a result, Texas integrates new power sources into the grid more quickly than any other region in the United States. ERCOT processes the interconnection requests for new power to connect to the existing grid at nearly twice the speed of some of its peers. Between 2021 and 2023, the state added at least 70 percent more capacity than any other market, almost all of it cheap, clean energy. Since 2021, Texas has added nearly 40 gigawatts of new clean power generation, enough to comfortably power all of New York State.

Texas is also the fastest-growing market for energy storage: last year, the state deployed more new battery capacity than California—enough to power around three million homes. Texas now has more than 12 gigawatts of battery capacity, which can soak up the glut of cheap solar and wind energy produced during the day and discharge it to consumers when the sun sets.

Texas has realized that using electricity at different times can be as efficient as adding new power. In addition to expanding its battery capacity, earlier this year the Texas state legislature passed a bipartisan law, Senate Bill 6, that allows Texas’s grid operator to encourage data centers and other large energy consumers to shift their power use in moments of extreme demand—or, if necessary, to order them to do so. This program could free up to 15 gigawatts of capacity, equivalent to nearly the total demand of Houston. At a national level, estimates have shown that if power-hungry consumers such as data centers shift when they consume energy just a quarter of one percent of the time, it could increase the United States’ effective production capacity by ten percent without building new infrastructure.

WORKING FROM HOMES

In addition to the strategies being deployed in Texas, another way to add capacity is to unlock the energy systems that already sit in homes and businesses across the country. Millions of generators, solar panels, batteries, and heating and cooling systems in homes and businesses produce, store, or consume energy. When utilities connect these systems to one another and operate them in concert, they can act like a power plant built from technology rather than steel and concrete.

The idea of a distributed power plant is not new. Starting in the 1970s, when the United States faced a wave of energy crises, utilities in states such as New Hampshire used phone calls and physical switches to coordinate thousands of water heaters to manage electricity demand. Today, basic communications technology such as WiFi and Bluetooth make connecting these assets even easier. Integrating them into the grid is far faster and cheaper than building a new physical power plant because these systems are already in place and paid for.

Studies have shown that a basic distributed power plant can deliver electricity 40 percent more cheaply than a conventional natural gas plant. In New York, the energy company ConEdison’s $200 million investment to tap into distributed energy sources allowed it to bypass $1.2 billion in physical infrastructure upgrades. These savings protect consumers from rate increases by avoiding the need for physical improvements to local poles, wires, and substations, which have been the single largest contributor to higher electricity rates in the United States in the last decade. Projections by the U.S. Department of Energy have shown that scaling distributed power plants could meet 100 percent of the projected growth in national electricity demand by 2030.

LOST IN TRANSPORTATION

Meeting rising electricity demand will require expanding the transmission and distribution infrastructure that moves electricity from where it is generated to where consumers want to use it. But construction of transmission is stagnating: the construction of high-voltage transmission lines has fallen from an average of 1,700 miles built per year between 2010 and 2014 to only 55 miles built in 2023. The resulting grid congestion raised consumers’ electricity bills in the United States by $11.5 billion in 2023.

Beyond building more transmission lines, increasing the transmission capacity of existing infrastructure with new and proven technologies can save billions of dollars in electricity costs each year. Advanced conductors allow wires to carry twice as much electricity as in the past. Sensors and software installed in wires can adjust electricity flows, which can add 20 percent or more additional capacity by enabling wires to safely carry more electricity when weather conditions allow. These upgrades do not require the same permitting process as new construction, meaning they can be deployed in months, not years, at a fraction of the cost.

Advanced transmission technologies have existed for decades and have been widely adopted in countries around the world. Real-world trials show they can be successful in the United States, too. One recent deployment of grid sensors in Indiana and Ohio took only nine months to install, increased capacity by more than 50 percent, and cost just one percent of the price of building new transmission lines. Other states are also beginning to see the potential of these new technologies. In Montana, for instance, the state legislature unanimously passed a law to incentivize utilities to install advanced conductors.

MOVE FAST AND BREAK THINGS

The looming energy crisis requires federal, regional, and state policymakers to embrace reforms that put consumers first and let efficient solutions win. In Washington, the agency tasked with overseeing the United States’ electric system, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has for years asked utilities and grid operators to consider reforms to boost efficiency and upgrade their technology. When utilities and grid operators push back, FERC generally relents. In January, for instance, FERC granted a grid operator’s request to delay until 2030 rules requiring it to allow distributed energy systems to participate in electricity markets.

Today’s electricity supply crunch offers a perfect moment to break the cycle. FERC should use its rule-making power to make interconnection reforms mandatory, provide clear timelines for upgrades, and levy harsh penalties for underperformance to ensure that capacity grows everywhere as quickly as it has in Texas. It should require that reforms put storage and distributed energy systems on a level playing field with physical power plants to determine which sources produce power at the lowest cost. FERC should also aggressively encourage grid planners to upgrade wires and transmission technology. Policymakers and utilities alike have stalled for too long and claimed reforms are too hard, but in the face of skyrocketing demand, such excuses ring hollow.

Despite the Trump administration’s rhetoric about efficiency, it is unfortunately pursuing a regulatory approach that increases uncertainty and reduces investment. Reforming the electric system, however, is precisely where the executive branch should embrace the impulse to break through the bureaucratic hurdles holding back reform.

Reforms should put consumers first and let efficient solutions win.

State policymakers also have an important role to play because state public utility commissions set many of the policies that govern utilities. For decades, the public has not paid attention to these institutions; this has empowered some utilities and their lobbyists to stymie attempts at reform. Facing rising prices, both state policymakers and citizens can no longer ignore these institutions. Public utility commissions—and the legislatures that oversee them—should pay utilities for better performance and hold them accountable for rising electricity prices.

In New Jersey, where electricity rates for households have increased by up to 20 percent this year, both Democratic and Republican candidates in the governor’s race have centered their campaigns on rising energy costs. Governors in other mid-Atlantic states, in which prices are rising because of constraints on new sources of power generation, are calling for interconnection reforms similar to those in Texas that allow projects to connect to the grid quickly. And just this month, Mike Braun, the governor of Indiana, appointed a new Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents consumer interests against investor-owned utilities, and directed her to evaluate utilities’ profits to lower rates in the state.

These reforms will help Americans as workers and consumers. Squeezing more value out of existing energy systems requires investing in the skilled tradespeople who can improve them. Upgrading energy infrastructure is labor-intensive, technical work that relies on electricians, line workers, HVAC technicians, and power engineers, not software alone. Solar and wind technicians are now the two fastest-growing occupations in the entire economy, projected to grow by about 50 percent over the next decade. And research has shown that skilled field trades like those that service the electric system stand to be augmented, not replaced, by artificial intelligence tools such as predictive maintenance and remote diagnostics.

In politics, solutions are never cheap or easy. But when it comes to energy, a set of solutions are at hand that can deliver cheaper and more reliable power right now. If policymakers, utilities, and energy companies optimize the resources available and focus on getting more from the existing system, they can lower electricity bills for consumers and prepare the country to be at the forefront of the next wave of innovation. With the right incentives, the United States can turn an energy crunch into a competitive advantage.",https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/09/08/2025-08-07T144959Z_1133835741_RC2D2GA4TZVT_RTRMADP_3_USA-ENERGY.JPG?itok=01W97eUV,N,,2025-09-09 13:06:12.132672

The California Water Efficiency Partnership defines non-functional turf as ""turf areas that are decorative and have no other functions, such as recreation.""

""Southern California's landscape is changing,"" said Michael Camacho, vice chair of the Metropolitan's board of directors, per My News LA. ""But looking around, you still see a challenge everywhere — grass that isn't played on, or picnicked on or even walked on except when it is being mowed.""

The Metropolitan Water District reported that up to 70% of the water used in Southern California is for grass or other outdoor irrigation, so the push to change the use of water-wasting, purely aesthetic grass is a smart move.

A common environmentally conscious alternative to high-maintenance types of grass is to switch to a natural lawn. By planting native-growing grass, such as local clover, you can avoid harmful chemicals in fertilizers and pesticides and reduce water usage while still benefiting from a healthy lawn.

Furthermore, a native lawn will be a pollinator-friendly place and act as a helpful part of the natural surrounding ecosystem.

Elsewhere in the country, other eco-friendly rebate programs are helping the transition toward a cleaner future.

For instance, multiple states have rebate programs encouraging the switch from gas stoves to induction options, which cook faster and don't rely on harmful dirty fuels.

While many of the tax rebates and discounts for environmentally friendly technologies under the Inflation Reduction Act will end at the end of 2025, some will remain in place, so looking into what rebates are available can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars.

That figure, calculated by the environmental campaign group Oil Change International, has more than doubled since 2017. And it is likely a vast understatement, due to the difficulty of quantifying the financial gains from some government supports, and to a lack of transparency and reliable data from government sources, the group says.

These handouts pose a massive barrier to decarbonization, says the new report, which experts have long warned is urgently necessary to avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis.

“These subsidies allow for new production that would not otherwise occur,” said Collin Rees, US program manager at Oil Change International and the primary author of the new analysis. “They also, to an enormous extent, go to lining the pockets of shareholders and investors and fossil fuel executives.”

For the analysis, Oil Change International totaled up tax breaks, lower rates to acquire land and other resources, direct appropriations, and other financial support from the US and government-funded groups, using the definition of fossil fuel subsidies established by the World Trade Organization.

All told, US subsidies allow the sector to receive stunning 30,000% returns on investments, the authors found.

The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s fossil-fuel lobbying group, for comment.

Among the biggest subsidies the US offers oil companies, the report found, is a federal tax rule allowing corporations to credit taxes and royalties they pay to foreign governments on overseas income against their domestic tax bills, to avoid being taxed twice.

Another major support measure is a tax credit for capturing carbon, which is often framed as a climate solution but is primarily used to extract hard-to-reach reserves in a practice known as enhanced oil recovery.

Amid pressure from campaigners and United Nations climate experts, at least 53 countries reformed their fossil-fuel subsidies between 2015 and 2020, according to the Swiss research group Global Subsidies Initiative.

In 2021, Joe Biden also vowed to begin eliminating subsidies for planet-heating energy sources.

“Unlike previous administrations, I don’t think the federal government should give handouts to big oil,” Biden said following his inauguration in 2021.

Yet the US is moving in the wrong direction on the issue, the new report found: Trump’s signature tax-and-spend bill, which the president signed in July, is poised to hand fossil-fuel companies an additional $4bn per year across the next decade, the analysis found.

Among the biggest supports for the oil industry in the megabill are expanded credits for carbon capture and a lowering of already sub-market royalty rates for coal, oil and gas production on public lands. Those enhanced supports could end up being even more valuable to the oil industry in later years, Rees says.

Another provision in the bill, for which oil companies lobbied, can allow those companies to avoid the corporate minimum tax which Biden established during his presidency.

Redirecting all US fossil-fuel subsidies to social programs could vastly improve life for ordinary Americans, the report says, for instance by providing 3 million families with Snap benefits annually, helping 54 million households install solar panels within a decade, or sending 3 million children to Head Start early learning programs.

Though US government supports for fossil fuels are esoteric and complex, they have massive implications for the nation’s relationship with polluting energy companies, said Rees.

“We’re dealing with technical legislative language and components of the tax code, but despite that, I think it’s important to understand that subsidies are political statements,” he said. “They are political choices about what we’re choosing to support as a country.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0395261abc815bd27ceef7e54279364d4982b5ae/314_0_7215_5773/master/7215.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2585cc3cc4b4e1a48519bec7004ebd8",N,,2025-09-09 13:06:01.839264

On a quiet street near the marsh in Charleston, South Carolina’s Rosemont neighborhood, Luvenia Brown watches the weather reports more than she used to. She’s lost lawn mowers, bikes and outdoor furniture to the rising waters that have repeatedly crept into her yard.

Brown’s home is elevated, so the water hasn’t reached the interior. Not yet. But she’s deeply worried about what the future will bring.

“If the water continues rising the way it is, I don’t want to be here,” said Brown, 58, who works as a medical driver. “I love my area. But I think my life is more important.”

Just a half mile to the south, a massive new development – expected to bring stores, offices and 4,000 homes – is springing up. Brown worries that all the new concrete and pavement will only make flooding where she lives worse.

Charleston is one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities – and one of the most flood-prone. As climate change prompts sea levels to rise and storms to grow more intense, this historic city has become a warning bell for what’s to come along America’s coasts: Some neighborhoods will retreat and others will be protected, and still others – often lower-income communities – may be left behind.

In Charleston, those futures are colliding. The city and the federal government are planning a $1.3bn sea wall to defend the iconic downtown peninsula with its regal, pre-civil-war mansions and majestic moss-covered live oak trees.

But under the current plans, the wall would not extend to lower-income neighborhoods like Rosemont, a historically Black community bordered by a freeway and hemmed in by industrial sites. That could leave those families more exposed to rising waters than ever.

“I’ve seen how all those floodwaters demolish people’s houses,” Brown said. “I don’t think I want to be part of that.”

Dozens of coastal cities from New York to California face similar threats. Driven largely by sea level rise, flooding in the coastal United States is projected to occur 10 times more often over the next 25 years, according to a recent analysis by the non-profit Climate Central. An estimated 2.5 million Americans could be forced to relocate over the next 25 years, the group found.

Nationally, poor communities are disproportionately affected by hurricanes and flooding, research shows.

The increasing floods are prompting insurance companies to raise premiums and decline policy renewals, creating incentives for residents to leave their homes. In fact, zip codes in coastal South Carolina are among those with the highest insurance non-renewal rates, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.

Rising water, growing crisis

Charleston was built along the confluence of three rivers and the Atlantic Ocean, on marshland and mud flats. Flooding there was once far less frequent.

But now, even an afternoon thunderstorm or an unusually high tide can overwhelm drainage systems and submerge streets. The sea level in Charleston rose about 13in over the past century, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and by 2100 it’s expected to rise about 4ft more.

Charleston is also one of the most rapidly sinking cities in the United States, mainly because of groundwater pumping and the settling of natural sediments and filled marsh areas. That double threat – rising seas and sinking land – leaves the city increasingly exposed to flooding.

According to Climate Central’s Coastal Risk Finder, more than 8,000 people and 4,700 homes in Charleston county will be at risk of annual flooding by 2050, even under moderate climate action scenarios. By 2100, more than 60,000 people could be affected.

Rapid development, meanwhile, is paving over forests and wetlands that once soaked up stormwater. Every new subdivision and strip mall replaces absorbent ground with impervious surfaces – asphalt, rooftops, parking lots – that send rainwater rushing into neighborhoods such as Rosemont.

The uneven fight against the sea

After Hurricane Matthew sent water surging over Charleston’s Battery wall in 2016, city officials consulted with Dutch flood experts and developed a comprehensive plan to protect the city against flooding. Federal officials proposed an eight-mile-long, $1.3bn sea wall to shield the city’s historic peninsula from future storm surges and sea level rise.

The city’s share will probably be $455m, Charleston’s mayor, William Cogswell, recently told a city committee.

But neighborhoods like Rosemont – just beyond the wall’s reach – would remain exposed. Parts of the neighborhood are projected to be underwater by the end of the century. And some have voiced concerns that the wall could actually make flooding worse in unprotected areas.

Skip Mikell, a longtime community leader in Union Heights, a historically Black neighborhood near Rosemont, stood at the end of Peace Street in Rosemont, looking out over the marsh.

“In 70 years, where we’re standing, if nothing’s done, it’s going to be water,” Mikell said, adding: “The gentry of Charleston have connections, they have money, they have a voice. These communities are voiceless.”

The long road to retreat

Retreat has already started to happen in Charleston. About 11 miles west of Rosemont, a tranquil expanse of weeds, marsh grasses and black-eyed Susans is all that’s left of Bridge Pointe, once a compact community of 32 townhomes. Beginning in 2015, the neighborhood experienced a succession of floods, and in 2017, Fema authorized $10m to buy out Bridge Pointe’s residents and some of their neighbors.

The neighborhood had experienced four major floods by then, making homes “really unsellable”, said John Knipper, one of the displaced residents.

It took nearly four years after buyout discussions began for residents to get money for relocation. A typical buyout can take more than five years, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. The US Government Accountability Office, meanwhile, found that there’s no national strategy for relocating people from flood-prone areas.

As wetlands disappear, risks grow

As former Bridge Pointe residents piece their lives back together, new homes will soon go up in another flood-prone area just a mile away.

Long Savannah is expected to bring up to 4,500 homes. It’s one of several massive projects rising across Charleston county, including Magnolia Landing and Cainhoy, 4,000- and 9,000-home developments. The developers of Long Savannah have received approval to fill and excavate wetlands, which environmentalists say are crucial to soaking up rain and keeping flooding in check.

The developers of Long Savannah and Magnolia Landing did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Cainhoy noted that the project was on higher ground than other flood-prone areas, and that 3,500 acres of wetlands will be preserved.

In the Cainhoy case, a federal judge in 2022 dismissed flooding concerns, citing a US army corps of engineers report, which concluded the development has a “high percentage of wetlands and … numerous direct outfalls to tidal waters that will minimize the potential for heavy rains to overwhelm its infrastructure.”

“Charleston has a history of building in repetitively flooded areas,” said Robby Maynor, a climate campaign associate with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which, along with other environmental groups, contested a decision by state environmental officials to allow new development on wetlands in the Long Savannah project. “We absolutely must stop building in low-lying and flood-prone areas to avoid making an already difficult situation even worse.”

City floodplain officials didn’t respond to requests for an interview. But in a brief email to Floodlight, the city floodplain manager, Caroline Schnell, pointed to flood protections – such as higher elevation standards and better stormwater systems – for new buildings in flood-prone areas.

‘Canary in a coalmine’

Ana Zimmerman has also been vocal about the dangers of letting developers fill creek-beds and build on low-lying areas.

In 2005, she and her husband bought their modest one-story home in a close-knit James Island neighborhood, just south of downtown. Like much of the area outside the city’s historic core, it falls beyond the protection of Charleston’s planned sea wall.

The first sign of trouble came early one morning in October 2015. It was still dark when she put her feet to the bedroom floor, water lapping at her ankles. A powerful storm had overwhelmed the street. Zimmerman rushed to save photo albums and the family cats, but the house suffered more than $80,000 in damages.

With the insurance payout and their own labor, the Zimmermans repaired the home.

But when Tropical Storm Irma hit two years later, Zimmerman remembers hearing neighbors screaming as 7in of floodwaters poured into her home – causing it to be declared a total loss.

Ultimately the couple abandoned the flood-damaged home and let it go into foreclosure, walking away from 12 years of equity. They now live nearby in a house on an elevated foundation. Zimmerman, who calls herself an “unintentional flood activist”, has pressed public officials for stricter building rules and clearer flood-risk disclosures.

She says her experience is a “canary in a coalmine” for other low-lying coastal communities.

“Entire neighborhoods will have to move,” said Zimmerman, a college biology professor. “But the vulnerable among us, there will be no one there to help them, save them, and they will not be able to save themselves.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8c0b1577daaa8af05b13694dee2eb22b43de6b9/773_0_3663_2931/master/3663.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8abb468fb9641481d0bd5d097647738",N,,2025-09-09 11:02:57.273999

Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.

The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.

Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.

While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.

“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”

According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.

In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.

Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.

Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.

The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.

In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.

But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.

Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.

“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”

In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.

While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.

“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.

Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.

In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.

One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.

“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”

In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.

Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.

However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.

“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.

Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)

“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”

Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.

Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.

Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.

Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.

A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.

Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.

“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.

At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.

State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.

Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.

“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”

Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.

While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.

“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”

Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.

“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Revolution-installed-turbine-082-e1757413693464.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:08:52.230516

According to Electric Hydrogen, the new acquisition and partnership come as rising demand for clean hydrogen in both the U.S. and EU is accelerating the market for hydrogen technology. Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical, such as metals manufacturing and heavy transport.

Founded in 2020, Massachusetts-based Electric Hydrogen manufactures powerful electrolyzers that produce green hydrogen from renewable electricity and water, aimed at enabling developers to build large-scale clean hydrogen projects at low cost. The company’s productized hydrogen plant, “HYPRPlant,” utilizes proprietary high-power proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer technology to deliver made with renewable energy, with installed project costs reduced by as much as 60%.

Founded in 2021, New York-based Ambient Fuels delivers custom-engineered solutions for green hydrogen projects aimed at supporting the decarbonization of heavy industry and transportation, with services from project development and design to financing and construction.

Jacob Susman, former CEO of Ambient Fuels – and now leading project development at Electric Hydrogen – said:

“With this unique project finance capability from Generate Capital, our team is well positioned to support Electric Hydrogen customers who prefer to buy renewable hydrogen as a process input rather than building and operating their own renewable hydrogen plants. We believe this is a key ‘unlock’ for the nascent renewable hydrogen and renewable fuels industries that will help customers get to scale faster, enabled by Electric Hydrogen’s leading technology.”

Generate Capital announced an investment in Ambient Fuels in 2023, with a commitment of up to $250 million to fund green hydrogen infrastructure.

Under the new strategic relationship, Generate Capital will offer up to $400 million in hydrogen project finance solutions globally.

Scott Gosselink, Managing Director at Generate Capital, said:

“Generate Capital is determined to accelerate the transition to low-carbon molecules by offering leading project finance capabilities in close collaboration with skilled developers and innovative technologies. Working with Electric Hydrogen, we can help solve current finance and bankability challenges and reduce LCOH, enabling more hydrogen projects to reach Final Investment Decision.”

According to Electric Hydrogen, its combination with Ambient Fuels, and the new financing collaboration with Generate Capital will enable the company to substantially reduce the levelized cost of hydrogen as a service, and provide the capability to originate, buy and sell large-scale clean hydrogen projects.

Raffi Garabedian, CEO and Co-founder of Electric Hydrogen, said:

“We believe this new integration will both enable the industry to scale faster and give Electric Hydrogen even more ways to serve our diverse array of customers – from those who want to do it all themselves, from power procurement all the way to the finished clean-fuel – to those who prefer a partner to finance and develop the hydrogen plant so they can remain focused on their business outcomes.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Electric-Hydrogen.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:07:51.445037

Known for its deep history in manufacturing, Michigan is poised to continue this legacy. Encompassing approximately 1,300 contiguous acres, the Advanced Manufacturing District (AMD) of Genesee County in Mundy Township near Flint is emblematic of the state’s history, and the greenfield site is shovel-ready for high-tech manufacturers looking to construct a large-scale transformative project.

More acreage is planned, with a goal of north of 1,400 acres when the AMD is fully assembled. The site is modeled to serve over a gigawatt of electricity use and 6.0 BCF per year of natural gas consumption.

The AMD has received recognition through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation’s MI Sites site certification program and received nearly $260 million through the Michigan Strategic Fund.

“Site selection decisions are focused on shovel-ready sites with energy infrastructure ready to go,” says Lindsey McGuirk, director of external engagement — growth at Consumers Energy, Michigan’s biggest electric and natural gas utility. “This site is well-positioned for those that want to move fast.”

A Leading Megasite

Ready for a large energy user, the AMD in Genesee County is a global best-in-class site, its leading attributes being its large size and rectangular shape. It has a water usage capacity of 5 million gallons a day and is served by robust surrounding infrastructure that includes rail access, seven freeway exits on I-75 and I-69 and the nearby Bishop Airport.

“This is a high-quality development — unlike anything we have seen in Genesee County,” says Tyler Rossmaessler, executive director of the Flint & Genesee Economic Alliance. “The state saw the success and the value of the site that we were having and came in full force with a strategic site readiness grant of nearly $260 million to help us fully assemble the site.”

The AMD in Mundy Township is also subject to a zoning mechanism called an “overlay district” to regulate the use on site and ensure that an advanced manufacturer or high-tech company will develop the property.

The soft infrastructure supporting the AMD is also key. The site is within striking distance of University of Michigan–Flint, Kettering University and Mott Community College and within an hour’s drive of three R1 universities (Michigan State University, University of Michigan–Flint and Wayne State University).

“We have the hard infrastructure, but we also have the workforce available to serve the advanced manufacturer that will eventually move to this location,” Rossmaessler says. “We have the workforce and the talent pipeline that exists in our county with available skilled labor and the colleges and universities and then the broader region beyond that. There is a huge labor shed when you are talking Saginaw, Lansing, Ann Arbor and Detroit. They can all flow to this site. And there’s a community that is really interested and dedicated to win projects.”

The project is viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to revitalize the surrounding areas as well as a great choice for manufacturers looking for reshoring or nearshoring options, supported by the infrastructure readiness.

“This is going to be transformational for Michigan and our local communities, bringing jobs and investment,” says McGuirk. “This taps into our talent, skilled workforce and heritage as a strong manufacturing state.”

Consumers Energy is a hand-in-hand partner with the Flint & Genesee Economic Alliance and the state of Michigan to support any project that would like to call the AMD in Mundy Township home.

Despite tech company SanDisk’s decision not to proceed with the project, stakeholders remain confident that the district’s top-of-the-line features and infrastructure will provide a true shovel-ready, accelerated speed to market experience for any advanced manufacturer or large energy user that wants to hit the ground running and have short lead times.

“The news about SanDisk was disappointing for us and the state of Michigan,” Rossmaessler says. “However, we’ve made the best site in America even better because of that effort. We’re looking forward to working with the same vigor and determination on the next project at AMD.”

Consumers Energy has a portfolio of programs available to customers with cost, energy efficiency and sustainability all in mind to provide the best results for project developments. Just after competitive pricing, sustainability comes as a major priority for developers and companies that Consumers Energy serves.

“AMD is thoroughly equipped to serve high-energy-demand customers, and those requiring more than 35 megawatts can take advantage of our large economic development rate that is truly tailored to serve advanced manufacturers’ energy needs,” McGuirk says. “It helps keep operating costs low which is a critical factor in siting decisions.”

The utility company touts a renewable energy program in which customers can participate and sponsor new solar and wind assets local to Michigan. General Motors was the landmark customer that helped the utility build the program and set its criteria. Other program participants include Comcast, Denso Automotive, Walmart, US Signal and 7-Eleven.

“Our clean energy solutions start with our energy efficiency programs,” McGuirk says. “Whenever a new business comes to town, we pair them with an energy engineer right from the start. Together, we review their plans and design an energy-efficienty facility from the ground up. That early collaboration helps them lower long-term operating costs and operate more sustainably, and opens doors to incentives and rebates.”

“We also have our demand response programs,” she adds, “which provide customers money back in their pockets to help support grid reliability.”",https://siteselection.com/media/Favicon-100x100.png,N,,2025-09-09 12:07:55.589030

LOST IN TRANSPORTATION Meeting rising electricity demand will require expanding the transmission and distribution infrastructure that moves electricity from where it is generated to where consumers want to use it.
The resulting grid congestion raised consumers’ electricity bills in the United States by $11.5 billion in 2023.","The United States faces an energy crunch of historic proportions. After nearly 20 years of flat demand, electricity use is now growing at its fastest rate since World War II. The U.S. economy increasingly relies on electricity to heat and cool homes, to power businesses and factories, and to propel cars, trucks, and buses. New manufacturing facilities, such as those making semiconductors, and the data centers that undergird the country’s artificial intelligence ambitions consume unprecedented amounts of electricity. In total, over the next decade, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the independent regulator tasked with monitoring grid reliability, projects that national peak electricity demand will increase 18 percent from today’s levels—nearly the equivalent of adding the total current demand of California, New York, and Texas combined.

The surge in electricity demand is not inherently a problem. It reflects the technology-fueled progress that electrification can deliver. But rising demand is already starting to drive up electricity prices and push the grid to its limits. Without rapid action, consumers will pay more, businesses will be less competitive, and the country will risk losing its lead in technological innovation and advanced manufacturing.

Although the United States must build new power plants, these alone cannot produce enough electricity fast enough to meet skyrocketing demand. Another solution, however, is readily available: squeezing more out of the existing electric system. U.S. energy infrastructure has much more to give. On average, roughly half the electric infrastructure in the United States sits idle at any point in time. This is because the U.S. electric system was engineered for moments of intense demand—the rare episodes of extreme heat or cold when the need for electricity peaks—not for delivering power to consumers in the cheapest and most efficient way. What has resulted is a system full of inefficiencies and lost potential.

The technology to get more out of the system already exists. Batteries can store excess power, sensors can boost how much electricity moves across wires, and software can aggregate distributed energy sources in homes and buildings and make them work together like power plants. Utilities, energy companies, and grid operators need to shift their focus from maximizing energy output to prioritizing improvements that will lower prices and increase reliability for consumers. In the face of rising prices and mounting macroeconomic stress, policymakers and energy players need to meet the political moment by adopting simple, straightforward reforms to utilities and energy markets that will benefit both individual consumers and the broader economy.

FEELING THE HEAT

For decades, the United States enjoyed a relative energy advantage. Electricity prices for industrial users ran at roughly half those for European competitors, and American households and businesses benefited from the United States’ vast energy resources.

The massive spike in demand for electricity, however, is rapidly driving up energy prices across the United States. Retail electricity prices in 2025 have increased at nearly twice the rate of overall inflation. In the first half of the year, utilities requested or received approval for a record $29 billion in rate increases, which means consumers will face higher electricity bills in the coming years. PJM, the regional grid operator serving customers from Michigan to Virginia, announced that the 67 million Americans in its region would see their electricity bills rise by up to 20 to 30 percent next year. Consumers are already feeling the pain: in an April survey run by PowerLines, a consumer education nonprofit, two out of three Americans indicated that utility bills are a source of financial stress.

As prices are increasing, reliability is faltering. U.S. power markets are failing to hold enough spare power to prevent blackouts when demand surges, such as on very hot or cold days. This year, nine out of 13 power markets in the United States are expected to fall below a critical reliability threshold, which marks the level at which the supply of spare power is considered sufficient to avoid outages.

This combination of higher prices and lower reliability poses a direct threat to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. The global economy is entering an era in which a few new or rapidly growing high-tech industries, including AI, innovative energy technologies, and cutting-edge semiconductors, will drive economic growth. Leading the world in these sectors requires an electric system that can power them. China, the main U.S. competitor in many of these fields, has poured money into electricity generation as part of a long-term plan to power more of its economy with electricity.

The good news is that the United States added nearly 50 gigawatts of new power capacity in 2024, the highest amount in more than two decades. But even at this record pace, supply from new power generation alone cannot keep up with rising demand because of supply chain constraints and regulatory bottlenecks. New natural gas plants are being delayed until the 2030s because of a 50-month backlog for natural gas turbines, and new nuclear power plants can take more than a decade to get off the ground. Renewables are cheaper and faster to deploy, but securing the permits for large-scale facilities and transmission can take years. And the interconnection queue—the waiting line for power sources to get approval to connect to the grid—has swelled to 2,600 gigawatts, or twice the size of the current grid. Washington’s recent tax and spending law, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, also raises costs by curtailing federal incentives for new sources of renewable power.

FROM QUANTITY TO QUALITY

The United States can meet staggering demand, however, without technological moonshots, long time horizons, or hefty price tags. This is because even modest improvements in the use of the existing energy infrastructure can yield huge gains. A five percentage point boost in the use of the country’s existing electric infrastructure would unlock the electric equivalent of roughly 60 new natural gas power plants.

Although increasing the efficiency of the existing infrastructure may seem obvious, it is the opposite of how the system has been designed up to this point. In the twentieth century, with limited energy generation technologies and few ways to easily improve efficiency, the goal was to build as many new power plants as possible. Policymakers rewarded utilities, which have a regional monopoly over electricity and whose profits are determined by regulators, on the basis of how much new capital they deployed rather than how well the system performed. Over the past two decades, energy developers have also largely adopted an install-and-forget approach: maximizing upfront capital investments while ignoring the expense of ongoing servicing and maintenance.

The result is a system that is both underused and underperforming. Data from the Federal Reserve indicate that the percent of electricity generation resources in use on average has declined by 10 percentage points over the last decade. Performance has deteriorated as well: outages increased by 60 percent from 2013 to 2023.

DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS

The electric system is underperforming because utilities and energy companies don’t get rewarded for making the existing system operate more efficiently or adopting new technologies that could render outdated systems obsolete. Instead, utilities are paid to figure out how to profit from building a new power plant, not how to adopt the cheapest, most efficient solution. But when policymakers change incentives and remove regulatory barriers for utilities and energy companies to adopt better technology, electric systems work better. Texas is an example of how to get this right.

Since 2021, electricity demand in Texas has grown nearly 20 percent because of record population growth, an influx of energy-intensive manufacturing, and the construction of new data centers. Peak energy demand in the state could double by the end of the decade.

Yet despite this growth, Texas is not facing an energy crisis. Electricity prices are falling, and grid reliability is increasing. Texas has chosen “all of the above” when it comes to strategies to boost electric capacity. This includes connecting new power plants to the grid quickly; installing batteries to store more of the resulting cheap, clean electricity and then releasing it to the grid when demand spikes; and requiring new large-scale electricity users to operate flexibly when connecting to the grid so that the system takes full advantage of its existing capacity without stretching beyond its breaking point. Texas is projected to have the lowest wholesale electricity prices of any market in the country in 2025, and the state has had no blackouts so far this summer.

In Texas, electricity prices are falling and grid reliability is increasing.

Unlike other operators that force new power generators to wait years before they can plug into the grid, Texas’s grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, uses a “connect and manage” model that connects new plants to the grid and then handles congestion by managing their operations in real time. As a result, Texas integrates new power sources into the grid more quickly than any other region in the United States. ERCOT processes the interconnection requests for new power to connect to the existing grid at nearly twice the speed of some of its peers. Between 2021 and 2023, the state added at least 70 percent more capacity than any other market, almost all of it cheap, clean energy. Since 2021, Texas has added nearly 40 gigawatts of new clean power generation, enough to comfortably power all of New York state.

Texas is also the fastest-growing market for energy storage: last year, the state deployed more new battery capacity than California—enough to power around three million homes. Texas now has more than 12 gigawatts of battery capacity, which can soak up the glut of cheap solar and wind energy produced during the day and discharge it to consumers when the sun sets.

Texas has realized that using electricity at different times can be as efficient as adding new power. In addition to expanding its battery capacity, earlier this year the Texas state legislature passed a bipartisan law, Senate Bill 6, that allows Texas’s grid operator to encourage data centers and other large energy consumers to shift their power use in moments of extreme demand—or, if necessary, to order them to do so. This program could free up to 15 gigawatts of capacity, equivalent to nearly the total demand of Houston. At a national level, estimates have shown that if power-hungry consumers such as data centers shift when they consume energy just a quarter of one percent of the time, it could increase the United States’ effective production capacity by ten percent without building new infrastructure.

WORKING FROM HOMES

In addition to the strategies being deployed in Texas, another way to add capacity is to unlock the energy systems that already sit in homes and businesses across the country. Millions of generators, solar panels, batteries, and heating and cooling systems in homes and businesses produce, store, or consume energy. When utilities connect these systems to one another and operate them in concert, they can act like a power plant built from technology rather than steel and concrete.

The idea of a distributed power plant is not new. Starting in the 1970s, when the United States faced a wave of energy crises, utilities in states such as New Hampshire used phone calls and physical switches to coordinate thousands of water heaters to manage electricity demand. Today, basic communications technology such as WiFi and Bluetooth make connecting these assets even easier. Integrating them into the grid is far faster and cheaper than building a new physical power plant because these systems are already in place and paid for.

Studies have shown that a basic distributed power plant can deliver electricity 40 percent more cheaply than a conventional natural gas plant. In New York, the energy company ConEdison’s $200 million investment to tap into distributed energy sources allowed it to bypass $1.2 billion in physical infrastructure upgrades. These savings protect consumers from rate increases by avoiding the need for physical improvements to local poles, wires, and substations, which have been the single largest contributor to higher electricity rates in the United States in the last decade. Projections by the U.S. Department of Energy have shown that scaling distributed power plants could meet 100 percent of the projected growth in national electricity demand by 2030.

LOST IN TRANSPORTATION

Meeting rising electricity demand will require expanding the transmission and distribution infrastructure that moves electricity from where it is generated to where consumers want to use it. But construction of transmission is stagnating: the construction of high-voltage transmission lines has fallen from an average of 1,700 miles built per year between 2010 and 2014 to only 55 miles built in 2023. The resulting grid congestion raised consumers’ electricity bills in the United States by $11.5 billion in 2023.

Beyond building more transmission lines, increasing the transmission capacity of existing infrastructure with new and proven technologies can save billions of dollars in electricity costs each year. Advanced conductors allow wires to carry twice as much electricity as in the past. Sensors and software installed in wires can adjust electricity flows, which can add 20 percent or more additional capacity by enabling wires to safely carry more electricity when weather conditions allow. These upgrades do not require the same permitting process as new construction, meaning they can be deployed in months, not years, at a fraction of the cost.

Advanced transmission technologies have existed for decades and have been widely adopted in countries around the world. Real-world trials show they can be successful in the United States, too. One recent deployment of grid sensors in Indiana and Ohio took only nine months to install, increased capacity by more than 50 percent, and cost just one percent of the price of building new transmission lines. Other states are also beginning to see the potential of these new technologies. In Montana, for instance, the state legislature unanimously passed a law to incentivize utilities to install advanced conductors.

MOVE FAST AND BREAK THINGS

The looming energy crisis requires federal, regional, and state policymakers to embrace reforms that put consumers first and let efficient solutions win. In Washington, the agency tasked with overseeing the United States’ electric system, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has for years asked utilities and grid operators to consider reforms to boost efficiency and upgrade their technology. When utilities and grid operators push back, FERC generally relents. In January, for instance, FERC granted a grid operator’s request to delay until 2030 rules requiring it to allow distributed energy systems to participate in electricity markets.

Today’s electricity supply crunch offers a perfect moment to break the cycle. FERC should use its rule-making power to make interconnection reforms mandatory, provide clear timelines for upgrades, and levy harsh penalties for underperformance to ensure that capacity grows everywhere as quickly as it has in Texas. It should require reforms put storage and distributed energy systems on a level playing field with physical power plants to determine which sources produce power at the lowest cost. FERC should also aggressively encourage grid planners to upgrade wires and transmission technology. Policymakers and utilities alike have stalled for too long and claimed reforms are too hard, but in the face of skyrocketing demand such excuses ring hollow.

Despite the Trump administration’s rhetoric about efficiency, it is unfortunately pursuing a regulatory approach that increases uncertainty and reduces investment. Reforming the electric system, however, is precisely where the executive branch should embrace the impulse to break through the bureaucratic hurdles holding back reform.

Reforms should put consumers first and let efficient solutions win.

State policymakers also have an important role to play because state public utility commissions set many of the policies that govern utilities. For decades, the public has not paid attention to these institutions; this has empowered some utilities and their lobbyists to stymie attempts at reform. Facing rising prices, both state policymakers and citizens can no longer ignore these institutions. Public utility commissions—and the legislatures that oversee them—should pay utilities for better performance and hold them accountable for rising electricity prices.

In New Jersey, where electricity rates for households have increased by up to 20 percent this year, both Democratic and Republican candidates in the governor’s race have centered their campaigns on rising energy costs. Governors in other mid-Atlantic states, in which prices are rising because of constraints on new sources of power generation, are calling for interconnection reforms similar to those in Texas that allow projects to connect to the grid quickly. And just this month, Mike Braun, the governor of Indiana, appointed a new Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents consumer interests against investor-owned utilities, and directed her to evaluate utilities’ profits to lower rates in the state.

These reforms will help Americans as workers and consumers. Squeezing more value out of existing energy systems requires investing in the skilled tradespeople who can improve them. Upgrading energy infrastructure is labor-intensive, technical work that relies on electricians, line workers, HVAC technicians, and power engineers, not software alone. Solar and wind technicians are now the two fastest-growing occupations in the entire economy, projected to grow by about 50 percent over the next decade. And research has shown that skilled field trades like those that service the electric system stand to be augmented, not replaced, by artificial intelligence tools such as predictive maintenance and remote diagnostics.

In politics, solutions are never cheap or easy. But when it comes to energy, a set of solutions are at hand that can deliver cheaper and more reliable power right now. If policymakers, utilities, and energy companies optimize the resources available and focus on getting more from the existing system, they can lower electricity bills for consumers and prepare the country to be at the forefront of the next wave of innovation. With the right incentives, the United States can turn an energy crunch into a competitive advantage.",https://cdn-live.foreignaffairs.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/09/08/2025-08-07T144959Z_1133835741_RC2D2GA4TZVT_RTRMADP_3_USA-ENERGY.JPG?itok=01W97eUV,N,,2025-09-09 12:08:56.570728

By maintaining the CAMT, Democrats in 2022 made the tax code broadly consistent with an international tax framework at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that requires corporations to pay a 15-percent minimum tax.
The CAMT adds an additional tax regime on top of that to make sure corporations pay a minimum of tax rather than modifying or restricting individual credits.","Democrats in the House and Senate say that new Treasury regulations will allow large corporations to avoid paying the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT).

The CAMT is a sweeping tax rule that Democrats updated in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and that Republicans largely left in place in their One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this summer, to the surprise of many in the accounting field.

But Democrats say that new guidance from the Treasury is undermining the rule and will allow corporations to avoid paying taxes on profits.

“These notices will allow major corporations to circumvent the law by using accounting trickery to pay zero taxes on their massive profits,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Angus King (I-Vt.) and others wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday.

They took issue with two proposed regulations in particular, one allowing companies to avoid the tax if their income is below $800 million. The threshold was set at $500 million by the Biden administration.

The other allows companies to factor in unrealized capital gains into their tax liability calculation, thereby lessening what they could owe in tax.

“In combination, these actions indicate that under President Trump, the IRS is at best delaying the full implementation of CAMT to allow the largest corporations to avoid paying taxes, and at worst abandoning its legal responsibility to administer and enforce CAMT altogether,” the lawmakers wrote.

By maintaining the CAMT, Democrats in 2022 made the tax code broadly consistent with an international tax framework at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that requires corporations to pay a 15-percent minimum tax.

This consistency allowed the U.S. to strike what Treasury called a “side-by-side” arrangement with the Group of Seven large economies over the summer that then allowed it to pull out of the OECD deal, which Republicans have long resisted.

Republicans threatened large capital taxes on foreign investors in the form of the Section 899 “revenge tax,” which was eventually dropped from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in order to make sure the US didn’t have to sign up to the OECD deal, which taxed profits more rigorously than the U.S. tax code does by not allowing company subsidiaries to merge their tax bills.

However, the exclusion of the U.S. from the OECD framework opens up the possibility of retaliatory taxes on big tech companies, such as the one that Canada recently put in place and then rescinded as part of trade talks with the U.S.

Alternative minimum taxes exist because the U.S. tax code contains so many targeted credits and deductions that taxpayers could get out of paying any tax at all if they made full use of the law.

The CAMT adds an additional tax regime on top of that to make sure corporations pay a minimum of tax rather than modifying or restricting individual credits.

The CAMT in its current form was the result of a massive regulatory effort under the Biden administration.

“Crafting the rules to implement this tax has been one of the most significant projects the Treasury Department has undertaken in decades,” the Treasury Department under the Biden administration said last year. “Congress delegated a significant amount of authority to Treasury to implement the CAMT.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/AP25164746289120.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-09 12:10:06.681090

While EVs typically come with higher upfront costs than gas-powered cars, lower maintenance and energy expenses over time are part of their appeal.

However, many drivers end up overpaying by charging during peak hours. Automating the process could reduce monthly bills while also taking the load off the electric grid.

In the new study, Keoleian and his collaborators conducted a life cycle analysis of the manufacture, use, and disposal of different kinds of 2025 model year vehicles. They analyzed 35 different combinations of vehicle class (pickups, SUVs, and passenger sedans) and technology (internal combustion engine, hybrid, plug-in hybrid with 35- or 50-mile battery range, and battery electric with 200-, 300-, or 400-mile range).

The researchers examined the impact of driving county by county. This was necessary because weather impacts vehicle performance (electric vehicles especially are less efficient in the cold), and the greenhouse gas emissions of electric vehicles depend on whether the local electric grid is powered mainly by coal, for example, or by renewables.

The analysis is the first to show that battery electric vehicles have lower lifetime emissions than all other vehicle types in every county across the contiguous United States, the researchers report in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.

Keoleian says he was surprised by how much better the battery electric vehicles fared in the current study than in a similar analysis his team conducted a few years ago. “This reflects the continued progress toward grid decarbonization and improved vehicle fuel efficiency. This is encouraging.”

On average across the country, gasoline-powered pickups have the greatest climate impact, with 486 grams of carbon dioxide emitted per mile. A hybrid pickup has 23% lower emissions and a fully electric pickup 75% lower. Electric sedans have the lowest overall emissions at just 81 g CO2/mile on average.

“The life cycle emissions savings from battery electric vehicles are tremendous compared to other powertrains,” Keoleian says. Depending on the vehicle type, an EV with a 300-mile range has emissions 31–36% lower than a plug-in hybrid with a 50-mile range, 63–65% lower than a hybrid, and 71–73% lower than a gasoline-powered vehicle.

For electric vehicles, the overall climate impact depends on the vehicle’s range. Greater range means a bigger battery, which results in more emissions during manufacturing. This highlights the importance of choosing a vehicle that matches individual driving needs – not only the smallest vehicle but the shortest battery range that can do the job.

The researchers also evaluated how emissions depend on a person’s driving habits – whether they drive mostly in the city or on the highway, and whether they use their vehicle mainly for commuting, for occasional long road trips, or for work as a contractor. The study is the first to evaluate how carrying cargo affects the lifetime climate impact of a pickup truck.

Even if an electric pickup is loaded with 2,500 pounds of cargo, it still emits less than 30% on average of what a gasoline pickup driven with an empty cargo bed emits, the researchers found. In a city like Seattle with a grid that uses mostly hydropower, the cargo load increases pickup truck emissions by a mere 1% per mile. In Cincinnati, where electricity is generated mainly from fossil fuels, the emissions increase by 20%. But that still beats the gasoline pickup.

The researchers also created a free online calculator where people can estimate their own greenhouse gas emissions based on their driving habits, the type of vehicle they drive, and where they live.

Even though the advantages of electrification are now country-wide, the calculator is still an important communications tool “at a time when EV tax credits are being terminated soon and other climate policies are being threatened,” Keoleian says. “There is still misinformation being reported regarding the advantages of electric vehicles.”

Alongside him were attorneys general Kris Kobach of Kansas, Liz Murrill of Louisiana, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, and then-attorney general of Alaska, Treg Taylor.
The attorneys general said they are also concerned by lawsuits from states and local governments that could result in financial penalties against fossil fuel companies for disasters attributed to climate change.
A group of Republican attorneys general, led by McCuskey, sued New York in February.
The Trump administration has also gotten involved by filing lawsuits against both states and against states like Hawaii that have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.","During a pair of public panel discussions during the last week of August, attorneys general from five conservative Republican states said they see climate ‘superfund laws’ passed by Democratic states as major threats to the fossil fuel industries of their state.

“I think that the group of people that are on this panel are all united in making sure that all of the expertise in all of our offices are being utilized to make sure that this doesn’t keep going, because it’s very, very dangerous,” said J.B. McCuskey, attorney general of West Virginia, at the annual meeting of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.

Alongside him were attorneys general Kris Kobach of Kansas, Liz Murrill of Louisiana, Marty Jackley of South Dakota, and then-attorney general of Alaska, Treg Taylor.

The attorneys general said they are also concerned by lawsuits from states and local governments that could result in financial penalties against fossil fuel companies for disasters attributed to climate change.

Vermont made history in 2024 when it enacted a law that allows the state to hold fossil fuel companies financially liable for the negative impacts of climate change on that state. New York followed suit with a similar law later in the year.

Under both laws, fines levied by the states and paid by fossil fuel companies would go into a large fund that would be spent on projects that could mitigate natural disasters or subsidize clean energy projects.

Other Democratic-led states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey and California, are considering similar laws.

“Now that we have a friendly EPA and a friendly administration, the blue states are deciding that they’re now going to be the EPA,” McCuskey said, speaking at a different panel hosted by the Republican Women of Anchorage.

The attorneys general, plus Ken Paxton of Texas, who was not present at the industry panel, nodded along as McCuskey spoke.

“Their argument is that every single permitted operation that happened in Alaska caused $75 billion worth of damage to the people of New York. It’s completely outrageous. And the problem isn’t just that it’s New York, it’s that Illinois has one. California is going to have one. Vermont’s going to have one. Massachusetts is going to have one. You name a place that has radical environmentalists running their government, and then it becomes an amount of money that’s not withstandable,” McCuskey said.

Taylor, who has since resigned as Alaska’s attorney general and is expected to run for governor, said he believes that in states with budget holes, “it’s pretty convenient just to raise taxes on oil and gas, right? And those states that don’t have oil and gas, that’s their way of dealing with their budget shortfalls, is to take it out of oil and gas through these types of acts.”

Fossil fuel businesses and trade groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed suit last year against the Vermont law.

A group of Republican attorneys general, led by McCuskey, sued New York in February. Another McCuskey-led suit, filed in May, targets Vermont.

The Trump administration has also gotten involved by filing lawsuits against both states and against states like Hawaii that have filed lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.

Those suits say companies should be financially liable for harm caused by climate change.

Speaking at the Alaska oil panel, Kobach said he’s concerned about climate lawsuits filed by cities and counties and believes they’re being encouraged by national environmental law firms and groups.

“The reason I’m so energized about fighting back against that is Ford County, Kansas, which you probably never heard of, where Dodge City is — little tiny county, rural county, very low population — somehow, they were convinced by some very well-heeled attorneys in California to be a plaintiff in one of these lawsuits. And so we’re chasing them around. My office is chasing them around, trying to get them kicked out of court because they don’t speak for the people of Kansas,” he said.

Taylor said he sees the same issue.

“We’re seeing those opportunistic plaintiffs’ attorneys convince municipalities and boroughs and cities to take on litigation that’s really not in their best interest and really puts money into their own pockets,” he said during the panel discussion.

McCuskey, of West Virginia, said his state is considering a law that would restrict the ability of local governments to sue.

Nationally, the fossil fuel industry is lobbying Congress to pass a liability shield law akin to the one passed in 2005 to protect the gun industry against lawsuits attempting to hold gun manufacturers responsible for gun crimes.

In June, McCuskey and other attorneys general wrote a letter to the U.S. Attorney General to offer support for a national liability shield to protect fossil fuel companies.

The National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities have each adopted resolutions opposing such a liability shield. Both organizations say that local governments should retain the power to file lawsuits.

McCuskey, speaking at the oil panel, got a laugh from the audience when he asked attendees what they thought West Virginians would say if New York tried to collect a fine from the state of West Virginia.

“Our big joke is that the people in New York are literally looking down on us from the skyscrapers that were built with coal from West Virginia,” McCuskey said at the oil and gas association panel. “So they’re not just looking down on us figuratively, but both literally and figuratively, and they just have no contemplation of why their economies were built by the people who do the work that’s happening here.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250828-attorneys-general-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 11:03:24.738535

US EV adoption timeline slips to 2039 amid policy delays, high costs, and charging gaps

Europe’s EV sales to surpass petrol and diesel by 2028, crossing 50% by 2032 under tightening emissions rules

China is pulling ahead in the global shift to electric vehicles (EVs), with Europe adjusting its strategy and the US facing headwinds, according to the latest EY Mobility Lens Forecaster. This AI-powered model projects light vehicle sales through 2050 across China, Europe, and the US.

Across these three markets, battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales are expected to exceed 50% by 2034, marking a pivotal moment. Meanwhile, hybrids and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) will maintain a 30%+ share through 2036, underscoring their role as a key bridge to full electrification.

Constantin M. Gall, EY Global Aerospace, Defense & Mobility Leader, says:

“The EV transition is advancing—but unevenly. The US faces policy uncertainty, high costs, and infrastructure gaps. Europe is on a steady recovery path under strict emissions targets. China benefits from stable policy and a robust EV ecosystem. Hybrid technologies are proving essential in bridging the gap to full electrification.”

China: Full speed ahead

The EY Forecaster projects BEVs will make up over 50% of China’s light vehicle sales by 2033, driven by lower costs and supportive policies like the new VII vehicle emission standards. NEVs (BEVs + PHEVs) are expected to hit 50% by 2025 and surge past 90% by 2034.

Even as China’s share of global BEV sales dips from 70% today to 54% by 2050, it will remain a dominant force in global EV growth.

US: Slowed by policy and cost

The EY Forecaster predicts a short-term spike in US EV sales is expected in 2025 as buyers rush to claim tax credits before they expire in September. But with incentives ending, new import tariffs, and legislative uncertainty—including the potential impact of “the One Big Beautiful Bill”—growth is likely to slow.

As a result, the US is now projected to reach 50% BEV adoption by 2039, five years later than previously forecast. Hybrids will remain a key option, peaking at 34% of sales by 2034.

Europe: Rebounding after 2027

The EY Forecaster suggests that in Europe, economic pressures, reduced incentives, and softer emissions penalties will dampen BEV growth through 2027. But stricter CO₂ limits and more affordable models are expected to drive a rebound, with BEVs surpassing 50% market share by 2032. Until then, hybrids—including PHEVs—will remain a cost-effective alternative, outselling BEVs until 2030.

Constantin says: “The near- to mid-term future will feature a diverse mix of powertrains, shaped by regulatory shifts, tariffs, and evolving consumer behaviour. What’s clear is that e-mobility will remain central to the future of transportation.”

The Mexico Electric Two Wheeler Market is estimated to grow to US$ 1.74 billion by 2033 from US$ 834.6 million in 2024, advancing at a CAGR of 8.55% from 2025 to 2033. This is owing to increasing fuel prices, government subsidization for electric mobility, and urbanization, all of which are driving demand for clean, affordable, and space-conserving personal modes of transportation in Mexican cities.

Electric two-wheeler is a battery-operated vehicle for personal use, such as electric scooters, mopeds, and motorcycles. They use rechargeable lithium-ion or lead-acid batteries and have low running costs, less maintenance, and no tailpipe emissions. Compared to conventional gas-guzzling bikes, electric two-wheelers are quieter and usually come with advanced amenities such as digital displays, GPS, and regenerative braking.

Electric two-wheelers are becoming popular in Mexico because of growing environmental awareness, fuel price inflation, and urban traffic congestion. The government is encouraging e-mobility with tax benefits and investment in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Young executives, delivery service companies, and environmentally friendly consumers are leading demand in urban cities such as Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Affordability, efficiency, and small size of electric two-wheelers make it suitable for short-distance travel, particularly in populous metropolitan areas. With advancements in charging infrastructure, the market is anticipated to develop in a sustained manner in the future years.

Drivers of Growth in Mexico Electric Two Wheeler Market

Increasing Fuel Prices and Urban Traffic

As fuel prices keep going up in Mexico, electric two-wheelers are turning out to be an economically favorable choice for regular drivers. Large urban centers such as Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara experience traffic jams, leading consumers to turn to small, agile electric scooters and bicycles. With lesser operating and maintenance expenses than internal combustion two-wheelers, electric two-wheelers are best suited for intra-city commutes. Their increasing popularity among delivery riders and office workers is a major growth driver, particularly as last-mile logistics requirements continue to grow across Mexico's fast urbanizing areas. In Mexico, both drivers and passengers are increasingly becoming interested in electric vehicles.

This growing awareness and acceptance of EVs is occurring very quickly, particularly among users who drive extensively within congested urban cities. These motorists are beginning to appreciate the obvious advantages of driving electric vehicles. Not only can EVs dramatically reduce their fuel expenses, but they also offer other financial benefits, including potential tax breaks. This positions EVs as a more desirable choice for individuals who wish to save in the long term while helping to create a greener environment.

Government Policies and Environmental Incentives

The government of Mexico has established policies aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging sustainable transport. These range from tax waivers to relief from import duties and investment in EV supporting infrastructure like charging points. City regional governments like Mexico City also impose low-emission areas that encourage electric vehicle uptake. Such encouraging policies are nudging producers and buyers towards cleaner modes of transport. Through its commitment to the Paris Agreement, Mexico's transportation electrification drive serves as a prime driver of the growing demand for electric two-wheelers in both urban and semi-urban markets.

Growing E-Commerce and Delivery Services

The booming e-commerce and food delivery sectors are significantly influencing the growth of electric two-wheelers in Mexico. With companies like Uber Eats, Rappi, and Didi Food expanding their delivery fleets, there is rising demand for cost-efficient, low-maintenance, and agile vehicles. Electric scooters and motorcycles provide a perfect solution for these needs, offering sustainability and affordability. Businesses are increasingly adopting electric fleets to meet ESG goals and reduce operational costs.

This commercial use is quickly propelling mass purchases of electric two-wheelers and hastening awareness among private consumers, thus driving market reach beyond personal mobility. Jan 2024, DiDi declared its membership in the Electric Mobility Association (EMA), a partnership dedicated to advancing electric mobility in Mexico. The firm has recently kick-started a project to increase its fleet by 100,000 electric vehicles by the year 2030, with a 1 billion pesos investment, and making DiDi the operator of Latin America's largest electric vehicle fleet.

Challenges in the Mexico Electric Two Wheeler Market

Limited Charging Infrastructure

The most urgent challenge for the Mexico electric two-wheeler market is the inadequacy of widespread charging infrastructure. In rural and semi-urban locations, public charging infrastructure is hard to find, and this causes users to experience range anxiety. This restricts the uptake of electric two-wheelers, particularly in these regions. In addition, most households do not have access to personal parking facilities with charging options. With little or no investment in fast-charging infrastructure and home charging solutions, the development of the electric two-wheeler market could be restricted notwithstanding increasing interest.

High Initial Purchase Costs

In addition to long-term fuel and maintenance savings, the initial purchase price of electric two-wheelers is still an inhibitor for most customers in Mexico. Both in comparison with conventional gasoline-powered scooters or motorcycles, as well as others with more sophisticated lithium-ion batteries and smart technology, EVs tend to be priced higher, particularly in their more advanced forms. This price elasticity is more acute among lower-income groups, which restricts widespread adoption. Also, the limited number of financing alternatives and education regarding total cost of ownership further suppresses the potential of the market, especially in non-major metropolitan areas.

VinFast Auto Ltd. expects to open its delayed North Carolina plant in 2028 while the Vietnamese electric vehicle maker continues to seek equity investors, according to Chairwoman Le Thi Thu Thuy.

As part of its shift to Asia amid growing losses, VinFast last month inaugurated the company’s first overseas factory in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu that will have an initial production capacity of 50,000 vehicles a year. It expects to open another assembly plant in Indonesia’s West Java by October.

Thuy confirmed that the company will announce a $200 million loan from Indian state-owned banks soon, she said in a Bloomberg TV interview. Bloomberg News reported in May that the automaker was seeking the loan from state-owned institutions.

VinFast is “constantly looking for other ways to fund the business,” she said. “So it’s still looking to bring in the equity investor at the price that is acceptable to us.”

As the company expands, it will “continue growing our credit profile,” Thuy said.

VinFast was poised to raise $1.5 billion by selling certain research and development assets to founder Pham Nhat Vuong. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year, VinFast said.

The billionaire has already pumped more than $2 billion of his own money into the EV maker and has said he’s willing to support it until his money runs out.

VinFast posted a net loss of about 20.34 trillion dong ($770 million) in the second quarter, 15% wider than the first quarter and 8.4% from a year ago, according to an exchange filing.

Vuong said in April the automaker will prioritize Asia — including India, Indonesia and the Philippines — over North America and Europe, where high logistics costs weigh on margins.

VinFast, which announced last year it was delaying a North Carolina EV factory until 2028, is “pushing forward” with the plan to open the plant at that time, Thuy said.

Parent company Vingroup JSC is considering expanding its entire business ecosystem — which includes developing mega cities, schools and hospitals — to India, she said. VinFast is committed to manufacturing automobiles and setting up EV infrastructure in the country, Thuy said.

That also includes the launching of taxi company Green & Smart Mobility JSC, or GSM, in the country. The taxi company is owned by Vuong.

But Democrats say that new guidance from the Treasury is undermining the rule and will allow corporations to avoid paying taxes on profits.
They took issue with two proposed regulations in particular, one allowing companies to avoid the tax if their income is below $800 million.
By maintaining the CAMT, Democrats in 2022 made the tax code broadly consistent with an international tax framework at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that requires corporations to pay a 15-percent minimum tax.
The CAMT adds an additional tax regime on top of that to make sure corporations pay a minimum of tax rather than modifying or restricting individual credits.","Democrats in the House and Senate say that new Treasury regulations will allow large corporations to avoid paying the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT).

The CAMT is a sweeping tax rule that Democrats updated in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and that Republicans largely left in place in their One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this summer, to the surprise of many in the accounting field.

But Democrats say that new guidance from the Treasury is undermining the rule and will allow corporations to avoid paying taxes on profits.

“These notices will allow major corporations to circumvent the law by using accounting trickery to pay zero taxes on their massive profits,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Angus King (I-Vt.) and others wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday.

They took issue with two proposed regulations in particular, one allowing companies to avoid the tax if their income is below $800 million. The threshold was set at $500 million by the Biden administration.

The other allows companies to factor in unrealized capital gains into their tax liability calculation, thereby lessening what they could owe in tax.

“In combination, these actions indicate that under President Trump, the IRS is at best delaying the full implementation of CAMT to allow the largest corporations to avoid paying taxes, and at worst abandoning its legal responsibility to administer and enforce CAMT altogether,” the lawmakers wrote.

By maintaining the CAMT, Democrats in 2022 made the tax code broadly consistent with an international tax framework at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that requires corporations to pay a 15-percent minimum tax.

This consistency allowed the U.S. to strike what Treasury called a “side-by-side” arrangement with the Group of Seven large economies over the summer that then allowed it to pull out of the OECD deal, which Republicans have long resisted.

Republicans threatened large capital taxes on foreign investors in the form of the Section 899 “revenge tax,” which was eventually dropped from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in order to make sure the US didn’t have to sign up to the OECD deal, which taxed profits more rigorously than the U.S. tax code does by not allowing company subsidiaries to merge their tax bills.

However, the exclusion of the U.S. from the OECD framework opens up the possibility of retaliatory taxes on big tech companies, such as the one that Canada recently put in place and then rescinded as part of trade talks with the U.S.

Alternative minimum taxes exist because the U.S. tax code contains so many targeted credits and deductions that taxpayers could get out of paying any tax at all if they made full use of the law.

The CAMT adds an additional tax regime on top of that to make sure corporations pay a minimum of tax rather than modifying or restricting individual credits.

The CAMT in its current form was the result of a massive regulatory effort under the Biden administration.

“Crafting the rules to implement this tax has been one of the most significant projects the Treasury Department has undertaken in decades,” the Treasury Department under the Biden administration said last year. “Congress delegated a significant amount of authority to Treasury to implement the CAMT.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/AP25164746289120.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-09 14:04:05.995435

This article is authored by Maciej Kolaczkowski, Manager, Advanced Energy Solutions Industry, World Economic Forum","China’s investments in renewables, energy storage and batteries, electric vehicles and nuclear, for example, aim to primarily reduce its reliance on oil and gas imports and to exert leadership in new technologies. Europe, meanwhile, made great efforts to decrease its dependence on oil and gas from Russia by investing in renewables and efficiency. Similarly, in the US, new policies are being introduced to reshore supply chains to the country.

Attention is also now laser-focused on how local pollution from energy production and use can be minimized through technology to secure a social licence to operate. It is about here and now, rather than 2050.

3. China’s domination

China is the dominant force in next-generation energy technologies. It is by far the largest energy investor globally, spending almost as much as the EU and US combined, pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the manufacturing and deployment of renewables, energy storage, nuclear power and more.

China’s industrial and energy policies are often considered to be very effective in driving domestic demand and building manufacturing and supply chains. The country dominates clean energy technology supply chains, from wind turbines and solar panels to batteries and electrolysers. This investment has been transformational for the country’s economy and has contributed to establishing China as a major player in global politics.

4. India ascends

India has set bold ambitions and demonstrated remarkable progress on its energy transition investment. It surpassed its 2030 goal of achieving 40% of installed capacity from renewable energy sources nine years ahead of time.

To replicate this success and complement it with ‘made in India’ goals, the central and state governments have implemented numerous tools, including incentives for domestic manufacturing and mandates for clean energy deployment. These are helping the country to emerge as a major player on the global stage when it comes to energy storage, clean hydrogen and solar panels.

Indian business champions pursue these ambitions at speed and scale. The Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex, for example, scheduled to start up in 2026, will house a gigawatt-scale manufacturing ecosystem of solar panels (10GW), battery storage (100 GWh) and electrolyzers for hydrogen (3 GW). It will be the world’s largest such complex, with a built-up area equivalent to four times the size of the Tesla Gigafactory.

5. AI hunger

Data centre electricity consumption is set to more than double to around 945 TWh by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, slightly exceeding Japan’s total electricity consumption today. AI is the most important driver of this growth.

However, grid connection queues are long and complex as building new transmission lines can take four to eight years. Generation equipment is also in tight supply, with turbine deliveries for new gas-fired power plants facing lead times of several years, often with deliveries scheduled in the next decade. As electricity grids are already under strain in many places, 20% of planned data centre projects could be at risk of delays.

In fact, power availability has decisively emerged as the leading factor for data centre site selection according to the 2025 Data Center Power Report by Bloom Energy, even ahead of things like proximity to fibre optic networks. In effect, almost a third of data centres are expected to run entirely on onsite power by 2030, bypassing the entire existing grid network. Interestingly, reducing carbon emissions is a lower, but lasting, priority: 95% of those surveyed for the report affirmed that sustainability and carbon reduction targets remain.

The advanced energy solutions community

The World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen and carbon removal. No single technology will solve the energy transition alone; a mix of solutions will be needed.

Different regions, industries and companies will have their strategies, but they must work together.

Platforms, such as the Forum’s Advanced Energy Solutions community, can help speed up this cooperation and accelerate the deployment of new technologies, such as energy storage, clean fuels, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and carbon removal, from decades to years.

The community engages industry leaders who drive frontier segments of the energy system to shape the advanced energy solutions industry vision and narrative. It supports partnerships among innovators, large energy companies, energy users and investors and informs policy-making.

In January 2025, EO 14008 was revoked, thereby terminating the Justice40 Initiative.
As of December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior, and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had taken actions to implement the Justice40 Initiative.
For example, in 2022 USDA established an Equity Commission that identified barriers to inclusion or access to USDA programs.
We were also asked, prior to the initiative's termination, to review implementation of the Justice40 Initiative.","What GAO Found

Executive Order (EO) 14008, issued in 2021 and revoked in January 2025, directed federal agencies to take action to address the disproportionately high and adverse human health, environmental, climate-related, and other cumulative impacts on ""disadvantaged communities."" Specifically, the EO established the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to such communities. Benefits could include, for example, improved health, lower home energy costs, or restored wetlands. The EO referred to this all-of-government effort as the Justice40 Initiative. The initiative did not itself create programs or provide funding. In January 2025, EO 14008 was revoked, thereby terminating the Justice40 Initiative.

As of December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior, and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had taken actions to implement the Justice40 Initiative. These actions included integrating related goals and strategies into agency plans, taking steps to address barriers underserved communities face in accessing federal programs, issuing internal guidance, and modifying programs covered by the Justice40 Initiative. For example, in 2022 EPA issued guidance directing the 28 National Estuary Programs receiving funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create a strategy describing how the funds would be used to increase benefits to disadvantaged communities, as well as how those benefits would be tracked.

The agencies also conducted outreach to Tribes, community groups, state and local governments, businesses, and the public to inform these efforts. For example, in 2022 USDA established an Equity Commission that identified barriers to inclusion or access to USDA programs. USDA then took steps to address those barriers, such as by publishing a guide to help underserved farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners better understand and access programs and resources available to them.

The three agencies also took preliminary steps to assess the results of their actions to implement the initiative. These steps included identifying data needed to evaluate barriers to and progress toward the Justice40 goal, and reporting on some programs' funding to and impacts on underserved communities. For example, Interior reported that as of fiscal year 2024 approximately 44 percent of the more than 9,600 abandoned oil and gas wells plugged by state and local partners with funding from Interior's Orphaned Wells Program were in disadvantaged communities.

With the termination of the initiative in January 2025, the overall results of agency actions remain unknown. According to GAO's review of agency and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) materials, by December 2024 EPA, Interior, USDA, and OMB had not reported on what benefits resulted from each program, how those benefits were measured, or what the overall amount of funding or benefits was delivered to disadvantaged communities. Further, as of December 2024, neither the three agencies nor OMB had reported any assessments of agency actions to implement the initiative. The three agencies faced a variety of challenges identifying and measuring benefits across programs that operate at various geographic and time scales—benefits that may be difficult to attribute or quantify and may take years to manifest.

Why GAO Did This Study

Federal agencies were tasked with implementing the Justice40 Initiative for their programs—including those established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act—that made investments in certain areas, such as clean transit and training and workforce development. By November 2023, 19 agencies had identified 518 programs that made qualifying investments, such as grants and loans, to Tribes, states, individuals, organizations, and other entities. According to the Executive Office of the President's 2023 Environmental Justice Scorecard, Congress appropriated approximately $618 billion total for the programs for fiscal years 2022 through 2027, including supplemental appropriations such as the IRA.

The IRA included a provision for us to support oversight of the distribution and use of funds appropriated under the IRA and whether the economic, social, and environmental impacts of those funds are equitable. We were also asked, prior to the initiative's termination, to review implementation of the Justice40 Initiative. This report provides information on the actions that three of the agencies with the most covered programs had taken, as of December 2024, to implement the initiative and related efforts, as well as steps they had taken to assess those actions. The three agencies GAO examined are EPA, Interior, and USDA. This report also provides information on how OMB had used the agencies' data on Justice40 implementation as of December 2024, prior to the initiative's termination in January 2025.

GAO reviewed documents from and interviewed officials and staff at EPA, Interior, USDA, and OMB to understand the actions each had taken as of December 2024 to implement and assess the Justice40 Initiative.",https://www.gao.gov/themes/custom/gao_uswds/dist/gao-img/gao-gov-icon-800-mod.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 09:59:51.603030

His comments, which were first published as part of an interview with the Financial Times on Monday, come as Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum prepare to travel to Milan, Italy, for the Gastech energy conference.

""Net zero 2050 is just a colossal train wreck … It's just a monstrous human impoverishment program and of course there is no way it is going to happen,"" Wright said in remarks shared by the U.S. Department of Energy on social media platform X.

Net zero refers to the goal of achieving a state of balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere and the carbon removed from it.

More than 140 countries, including major polluters such as the U.S., India and the European Union, have adopted plans to reach net zero by various timelines.

To meet the critically important warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, as prescribed in the landmark Paris Agreement, global carbon emissions should reach net zero by around the middle of the century, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit non-profit.

For high-income nations such as the U.S., this means reaching net zero by 2050 or earlier. Low-income countries can meanwhile achieve the feat by the 2050s or 2060s.

A former oil and gas executive, Wright has recognized climate change as a global challenge that ""deserves attention,"" while criticizing what he has described as ""climate alarmists.""

Scientists, meanwhile, have challenged Wright's comments on climate change, describing them as ""a regurgitation of misinformative talking points.""

Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, are the primary cause of climate change.

The Trump administration official, who is scheduled to deliver an address on the U.S. vision for global energy security at Gastech on Wednesday, has reportedly warned that European climate rules could threaten the EU's trade deal with the White House.

The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, the world's first carbon border levy, and the bloc's regulation on methane were among some of the measures cited by Wright as potential risks to the U.S.-EU trade framework, according to the Financial Times.

A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, declined to comment.

Under the terms of the U.S.-EU trade pact, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described as a ""good deal"" when it was struck, the EU has said companies in the 27-nation bloc have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion in various sectors by 2029.

Bottom Line The EV credit has been a driving force behind the rapid adoption of electric vehicles.
If you’re serious about buying an EV—whether new, used, or for your business—act before September 30, 2025.
Because as of October 1, the road to EV tax credits closes.","If you’ve been eyeing an electric vehicle (EV) as your next ride, the clock is ticking. The federal EV tax credits—worth up to $7,500 for new vehicles, $4,000 for used ones, and as much as $40,000 for commercial fleets—will officially expire on September 30, 2025.

That means buyers and businesses have just a few weeks left to cash in on one of the most powerful clean energy incentives in the tax code. After that? Unless Congress acts, it’s gone.

What’s Available Now

⦁ New EVs (Clean Vehicle Credit, Section 30D): Up to $7,500, depending on whether both the battery sourcing and critical minerals requirements are met. MSRP limits apply: $55,000 for cars, $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and trucks.

⦁ Used EVs (Section 25E): Up to $4,000 (or 30% of the sale price, whichever is less). Eligible vehicles must cost $25,000 or less, be at least two years old, and purchased from a dealer—not a private party.

⦁ Commercial EVs (Section 45W): Up to $7,500 for light-duty EVs and a whopping $40,000 for heavy-duty vehicles.

Who Qualifies

Income limits (based on modified adjusted gross income, MAGI) apply:

⦁ New EVs: $150,000 (Single), $225,000 (Head of Household), $300,000 (Married Filing Jointly).

⦁ Used EVs: $75,000 (Single), $112,500 (Head of Household), $150,000 (Married Filing Jointly).

The Fine Print (and Loopholes)

⦁ Delivery Loophole: If you sign a purchase contract and make payment by September 30, 2025, you still qualify for the credit—even if your car isn’t delivered until later.

⦁ Leases: Consumer leasing is no longer eligible. The credit goes to the leasing company, and that “leasing loophole” ends with the credit on September 30.

⦁ Commercial Fleets: Same deadline. If your company is considering electrifying, now is the time.

Why You Shouldn’t Wait

⦁ Inventory pressure: As the deadline approaches, expect a surge in EV demand, limited availability, and fewer options.

⦁ No guarantees: Unless new legislation extends it, this incentive disappears.

⦁ Immediate impact: A $7,500 reduction in your tax bill is real money—and for businesses, the $40,000 commercial credit can dramatically improve ROI on fleet upgrades.

Bottom Line

The EV credit has been a driving force behind the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. But like all good things in the tax code, it’s temporary.

If you’re serious about buying an EV—whether new, used, or for your business—act before September 30, 2025. Sign that contract, make the payment, and lock in the credit while you still can.

Because as of October 1, the road to EV tax credits closes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. oilfield services firm Baker Hughes is collaborating with Controlled Thermal Resources in California to develop one of the world's largest single geothermal power projects, with plans to market the electricity to data centers, the companies said on Tuesday.

Energy-intensive data centers, which are used to produce the next wave of artificial intelligence technologies, are driving U.S. power demand to record highs and propelling the advancement of electricity sources that had been in decline or sparsely used.

CTR has been working on the development of its ""Hell's Kitchen"" geothermal power and critical minerals project for roughly 13 years. The privately-held company has about 4,500 acres (18.2 square kilometers) in and around the Salton Sea in Imperial County, California for development.

Baker Hughes has signed onto the second phase of Hell's Kitchen, which involves producing 500 megawatts of power, or enough to power about 375,000 homes, with the possibility of expanding from there, CTR told Reuters.

Baker will deploy high-temperature drilling technologies, power systems, and services historically used for oil and gas field production to help streamline and lower project costs, CTR CEO Rod Colwell told Reuters.

""That kind of expertise is very powerful,"" Colwell said.

Baker will also assist in raising capital for the project.

While geothermal energy has been used in the U.S. for decades, it remains less than 0.5% of the country's electricity supplies due partially to high upfront costs.

Recently, however, geothermal power producers have found new customers in Big Tech as the Silicon Valley companies scour for the vast amounts of electricity needed for their AI expansion plans.

Meta, in June, said that it had signed power purchase agreements for advanced geothermal in New Mexico for its data centers. Google reached an agreement last year for geothermal power in Nevada.

Conventional geothermal energy production involves drilling wells deep into the earth to release extremely hot salty brine, which produces steam that can be used to propel power turbines.

Geothermal power plants, according to the Energy Information Administration, emit about 99% less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel power plants.

CTR declined to provide details on the total project costs.

CTR is nearing a final investment decision on the first phase of Hell's Kitchen, which involves producing 50 MW of electricity that has been committed to the local electric utility. Commercial operations for that phase are supposed to begin in 2027.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters-finance.com/3ec6b3e05f1cdc4a0e38aa521257f79d,N,,2025-09-09 09:59:47.952912

As reservoir waters flowed into the turbines of the Grand Renaissance Dam, Ethiopians dressed in colorful regalia viewed the ceremony on large screens across the capital, Addis Ababa, and celebrated the achievement with dancing to traditional music.

“We will have enough power to charge our electric vehicles from the new dam,” said Belay Tigabu, a bus driver in Addis Ababa’s main bus terminal.

The almost $5 billion mega-dam, located on a tributary of the River Nile in the northwest of the country, near the border with Sudan, will produce more than 5,000 megawatts and is expected to double national electricity generation capacity, according to officials.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, speaking during the launch, said the dam was a “big achievement” that would show the world what Africans are capable of accomplishing. Dozens of visiting African heads of state and government joined Abiy for the inauguration, with many expressing interest in importing power from Ethiopia.

“I am proud to announce we will soon be signing an agreement with the government of Ethiopia to receive electricity from the dam that will benefit our hospitals and schools,” said South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir.

Kenyan President William Ruto said his nation is looking to sign a power purchasing agreement with Ethiopia based on the resources of the dam project, which he said was a “pan-African statement.”

Already an importer of Ethiopia electricity, Ruto said Kenya is seeking to alleviate the electricity deficit his country is experiencing. He said the dam “exemplifies the scale and ambition of African-led infrastructure and aligns with the Africa Union’s vision of continental energy connectivity.”

But Ethiopia’s new dam has faced controversy, with neighboring Egypt expressing concerns over reduced water flows downstream.

Egypt has long opposed the dam because of concerns it would deplete its share of Nile River waters. The Arab world’s most populous country relies almost entirely on the Nile to supply water for agriculture and its more than 100 million people.

Tamim Khallaf, a spokesperson for Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told The Associated Press that the dam posed an “existential threat.”

“There was no prior notification, proper consultations, or consensus with downstream countries, thereby constituting a grave violation of international law,” he said.

Abiy assured his neighbors on Tuesday that Ethiopia does not plan to hurt them, and that they will have shared prosperity.

“I assure you that Ethiopia will never take away your rightful share,"" he said. ""Today, I make this promise before my people. The hunger of our brothers in Egypt, in Sudan, or anywhere else is also our hunger. We must share and grow together, for we have no intention of harming anyone.”

There is a strong sense of pride in what Ethiopia has managed to accomplish with the completion of the dam.

A 20-year-old university student, Yabsira Misganw, who was advertising a new online shopping mobile app, said the new dam “will provide stable electricity and improve online services.”

The bill reflects the politically-divisive nature of the U.S. biofuels policy, which pits the country’s oil industry against the farm interests that underpin U.S. production of biofuels like corn-based ethanol.

At the heart of the current fight is whether larger refineries should be forced to make up for the biofuel blending requirements that small refineries avoid through federal exemptions. The Environmental Protection Agency has submitted a proposal on the issue for White House review, and its contents have not yet been made public.

“Punishing American energy producers who comply with the EPA’s made-up rules isn’t just unfair, it’s bad for everyday consumers. Americans will pay more at the pump and Utah’s refineries will suffer,” Lee said in a statement.

The biofuel fight adds another headache for Trump as he tries to keep Republicans united ahead of a possible government shutdown. Funding for federal agencies runs out at the end of the month, and the fight over small refinery exemptions is dividing GOP lawmakers just when Trump needs their support to pass his budget and avoid a shutdown.

The EPA recently cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016 — a sweeping move that is now forcing the White House to review how billions of gallons of biofuel blending obligations should be handled going forward.

The EPA offered the White House a preferred option to deal with the exempted gallons, as well as other options that will also be weighed during the review, Reuters reported. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.

The bill, titled the Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act of 2025, would amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from reallocating renewable fuel obligations. Republican Senators John Barrasso, of Wyoming, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, are also sponsors.

Governor Newsom signs executive order to accelerate projects at risk of losing IRA support

PV-Tech – September 4

Governor Gavin Newsom has signed an executive order to accelerate the permitting of energy generation projects that could be set to lose Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) support, many of which are renewable power projects. The order is a response to the federal reconciliation bill passed earlier this year. The order instructs the state’s Energy Working Group – established by an earlier executive order – to “immediately identify” energy generation projects that are eligible for IRA tax credits but could lose these credits under the new federal policies, and “to support state agencies in taking all steps necessary and authorized by law to accelerate and prioritize all permitting [and] approval” of such projects.

The company is launching a more affordable model but faces a slowdown in demand due to the phaseout of federal tax credits and waning consumer interest. Rivian joins other car companies such as GM and Volkswagen in anticipating a slowdown in EV sales.

Rivian, the electric vehicle (EV) startup, has announced a round of layoffs, affecting approximately 200 employees, or 1.5% of its total workforce [1]. This move comes as the company prepares for a challenging year with fewer incentives for EV purchases, due to the phaseout of federal tax credits and waning consumer interest. Rivian is not alone in anticipating a slowdown in EV sales; other major automakers like General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen (VW) are also expecting a downturn in the fourth quarter [2].

Rivian's layoffs are part of a broader effort to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs ahead of the launch of its more affordable R2 SUV, scheduled for 2026. The company has been under pressure to cut costs due to steep financial losses, rising costs from tariffs, and the loss of EV credits. Rivian reported a second-quarter net loss of $1.1 billion and maintained its 2025 delivery guidance of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles, down from 51,579 vehicles last year [1].

The R2 is expected to enter production in 2026 at Rivian's factory in Normal, Illinois, with a target price of $45,000 before shipping for the base trim. This pricing strategy aims to broaden Rivian's appeal and capture a larger segment of the EV market. However, the company faces significant challenges, including regulatory changes under the Trump administration, which could hold up as much as $100 million in revenue tied to compliance credits [2].

Rivian's latest cost-cutting effort is not an isolated event but part of a series of workforce reductions. The company has already implemented several rounds of layoffs, including the December 2023 layoff of up to 20 members of its battery development team and a February 2024 reduction of about 10% of its salaried workforce [2].

Despite these challenges, Rivian maintains that it has sufficient capital to bring the R2 to market. The company is also planning to build a second factory in Georgia to support its expansion plans. As the EV industry continues to evolve, Rivian's strategic moves and cost-cutting measures will be closely watched by investors and financial professionals alike.
