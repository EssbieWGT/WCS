Japanese automakers, including Nissan, have had to reassess parts of their strategy in the region as new U.S. trade rules, the expiration of EV tax credits, and reduced demand have created challenges.

The two midsize electric SUVs — one for Nissan and the other for luxury brand Infiniti — were expected to begin production at the automaker’s plant in Mississippi in 2028.

However, the timeline has now been delayed to late 2028 or early 2029, Nikkei reported.

The company had initially planned to launch five electric vehicles in the U.S., but has since canceled development of a small SUV and a sedan, reducing its pipeline to three EV models.

The shift comes after the Trump administration’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ eliminated EV tax credits effective September 30. The Biden-era incentives, worth up to $7,500, were initially aimed at boosting sales of North American-made EVs.

A 2023 revision under the Biden administration expanded eligibility to include leased vehicles made overseas, which lifted EV lease penetration from 10% in early 2023 to 66% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive.

Japanese and South Korean automakers lacking U.S. EV production facilities depended on leasing provisions to maintain their competitive edge.

EV demand faces additional pressure from incentive elimination while also struggling with high vehicle costs, insufficient charging stations, and widespread preference for gasoline SUVs. Currently, EVs account for just 7% of new vehicle sales in the U.S.

In April, EV incentives averaged 14.5% of sticker prices — double that of gasoline cars — but demand remains sluggish.

Meanwhile, Nissan’s battery supplier, AESC, has suspended construction of a plant in South Carolina. If EV demand continues to stagnate, U.S. battery production capacity could become excessive, Nikkei reported, citing a finance industry source.

Separately, Nissan reportedly halted production in May of three Canada-bound models — the Pathfinder and Murano SUVs, built in Tennessee, and the Frontier pickup, produced in Mississippi — following the Trump administration’s decision in April to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports.

Mazda also paused Canada-bound production at its Alabama plant and is shifting output to the U.S. market, the company said.

Other Japanese automakers are also adjusting. Toyota has postponed EV production in Indiana by two years and is increasing the output of hybrid and gasoline versions of the Grand Highlander SUV. Honda has halted the development of a large electric SUV it had positioned as a key product for the U.S. market.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for Nissan was ‘bullish’ amid ‘extremely high’ message volume by late Tuesday.

Nissan’s U.S. shares have declined 26.8% so far this year.

The deficit-boosting bill President Donald Trump signed into law last Friday included provisions that will undermine US clean energy development. Indeed, a team led by Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins estimates that it will reduce US solar and wind output by at least 300 gigawatts by 2035—enough to power some 225 million homes.

But some Republicans still thought the bill didn’t go far enough. After a failed last-minute bid to add further subsidy cuts and an industry-killing renewables tax to the bill, Republicans agreed to vote yes after Trump promised to take matters into his own hands.

He delivered on Monday with an executive order titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.”

The order basically instructs the Treasury Department to deny a developer’s application for soon-to-disappear clean energy subsidies “unless a substantial portion” of their project is already built. It also directs the Department of the Interior to revise policies favoring renewables. “While many executive orders have limited effectiveness, this one might actually have some bite,” says Yale energy economist Kenneth Gillingham.

“The Trump administration is taking every opportunity it can find to assert its authority not to spend money on things with which it disagrees,” says Don Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “The implications here are enormous.”

Because of the time it takes to permit and site US projects, Gillingham says, the order’s stringent interpretation of the statutory language will have “the effect of quashing the market sooner than would have happened otherwise.”

Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national organization of business leaders advocating for smarter climate policies, isn’t too pleased with the order. “Just in case last week’s legislative sledgehammer didn’t do enough damage to our economy, our environment, and the pocketbooks of anybody who pays an electricity bill, the Trump administration is taking yet another swing,” he said.

Trump’s decree asserts that renewables threaten “the fiscal health of the Nation,” a claim Gillingham deems entirely false. “Renewables cost something, but they create jobs and generate clean energy.”

“Our workforce is growing, businesses are expanding, and communities are saving money with consistent, reliable energy,” explains Bill Johnson, the owner of Brilliant Harvest, a Florida solar company, but the legislation and subsequent order put that progress at risk, he says.

The order, Keefe told me, suggests that the administration “either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.”

And although Trump questions the reliability of renewables, Gillingham insists that “at the levels of renewable energy we have today, we have nothing to worry about.” He adds, “If anything, adding more renewable capacity could help us meet additional electricity demand.”

As for the notion that the renewable energy market is “dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries,” well, sure, China dominates the sector, but that’s the result of supportive policies, Gillingham says—and the policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete: “We would have to support our clean energy industries if we wanted to increase our share of clean energy manufacturing.”

Solar company stocks took a hit after the order was released. Gillingham says “the combination of high tariffs and removing the tax credits is a one-two punch that will greatly suppress the market for renewable energy.”

Johnson, the renewable energy businessman, concurs: “These federal policies create uncertainty [which] threatens to stall projects already in the pipeline and make it harder to keep building here at home.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25189618341984.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:01.540664

Trump’s EO Ends Support for “Unreliable” Green Energy

Trump’s administration labeled these renewable sources as unreliable, expensive, and overly dependent on foreign supply chains. According to Trump, clean energy policies threaten U.S. national security, disrupt the electric grid, and harm the natural environment.

This executive order marks a major reversal from the direction set by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats, which offered strong incentives for clean energy projects.

Now, Trump’s energy policy shifts back to conventional energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear—those he calls “reliable and dispatchable.” His administration argues that green energy has received unfair advantages and is weakening the nation’s energy system.

Tax Breaks for Renewables Face the Axe

As part of the executive order, the Treasury Department is now required to end tax credits for wind and solar production. It must also apply stricter rules concerning foreign-controlled companies involved in renewable energy supply chains.

In addition, the Interior Department must revise current policies that have so far favored renewables, such as streamlined permitting and lease arrangements. Both agencies have 45 days to submit detailed reports of their actions to the White House.

Moreover, the order freezes new permits and approvals for wind energy projects, especially offshore developments. Until a full government review is completed, federal agencies are barred from issuing new loans or contracts for wind projects. This decision creates immediate uncertainty in a sector that has been growing rapidly due to both state and federal commitments.

Wind Power at Risk: What’s at Stake

As per EIA, currently, wind energy plays a vital role in the U.S. electricity mix, contributing about 10% of the nation’s power, making it the largest single source of renewable energy. In states like Iowa and South Dakota, wind supplies more than half of all electricity.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over 131,000 Americans are employed in wind energy-related jobs. These workers now face an uncertain future as federal support for their industry is scaled back.

Under the new law, developers will only be able to claim tax benefits for wind and solar projects if construction begins before the end of 2026. Furthermore, these projects must be completed and placed in service by the end of 2027.

Previously, developers could rely on tax incentives through 2032 under the 30% tax credit program. The shorter timeline could discourage companies from launching new renewable projects due to the higher financial risks and increased upfront costs.

Offshore Wind Goals in Limbo for States

This dramatic shift in policy could most severely impact states with ambitious climate targets. For instance, New York aims to install nine gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035, enough to power roughly six million homes. The state has already invested heavily in infrastructure and workforce development to support this target.

Similarly, New Jersey plans to develop 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040 and transition to a 100% clean energy power sector by 2050.

Offshore wind was a central pillar in both states’ strategies. Now, with federal support in question, these states may be forced to revise their energy roadmaps or find alternative funding solutions. Several state officials have already expressed concerns that their clean energy timelines may slip, which could push critical emissions targets further into the future.

Solar Slowdown: Cheap Power Faces New Roadblocks

The clean energy sector, especially solar, has made remarkable progress in lowering costs. Today, solar energy is one of the cheapest sources of new electricity in the United States. However, despite falling prices, large-scale projects still rely heavily on financial incentives to offset their high upfront expenses.

According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of new capacity in Q1 2025. This was a 7% drop compared to Q1 2024 and a 43% decrease from Q4 2024.

If these federal benefits are removed, it could significantly slow the pace of new solar developments. It may also discourage private investors at a time when international competition in green energy is heating up.

What’s Next for U.S. Energy Policy Under Trump?

Supporters of the move believe that Trump’s new policy will help restore American energy independence and reduce unnecessary government spending. His energy policy puts the spotlight back on fossil fuels and nuclear power. On his first day back, he declared a “National Energy Emergency” aimed at eliminating what he calls bureaucratic barriers to energy production.

Fossil Fuels Back in the Spotlight

So, as part of this plan, he established the National Energy Dominance Council, which will focus on increasing fossil fuel production, attracting private investment, and accelerating domestic energy production.

According to Trump, returning to traditional energy sources will strengthen the economy, create well-paying jobs, reduce trade deficits, and improve the U.S. position on the global stage.

A Major Clean Energy Setback

Countries across Europe and Asia are increasing their investments in renewables, treating green energy as both an environmental and economic priority.

According to the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report, global energy investment is projected to reach $3.3 trillion in 2025.

Out of this, approximately $2.2 trillion will go toward clean energy sources like renewables, nuclear, power grids, storage, low-emission fuels, energy efficiency, and electrification. That’s twice the amount, around $1.1 trillion, allocated to fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal.

So if the U.S. steps back from clean energy leadership, it could fall behind in both technology development and global market share.

Thus, critics warn that this approach overlooks the long-term risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels, especially in a world already experiencing the impact of climate change.

Many cities, companies, and even Republican-led states have embraced renewables, not just for environmental reasons but also for economic growth. Pulling back federal support now, they say, risks stalling progress and undermining years of clean energy investment.

The Bottom Line: U.S. Climate Goals at Crossroads

In the near term, this executive order is expected to cause major uncertainty across the wind and solar industries. Projects currently in the pipeline could be delayed or canceled entirely.

Developers who had planned on receiving federal tax credits now face stricter deadlines and higher costs. Meanwhile, states will need to reevaluate their clean energy goals and consider alternative funding methods to stay on track.

Over the next several months, federal agencies will begin to implement the executive order. Their decisions and the public and state-level responses will shape the future of U.S. energy policy. Whether this move marks a new era of energy dominance or a costly detour from climate leadership remains to be seen.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2551753511.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:30.918212

Stronger storms often lead to more damage and higher insurance rates.

The aerodynamic shape of Tener's home is built to reduce wind pressure by 30%. Inside, trusses fan out like spokes on a bicycle wheel, distributing storm forces to help keep the roof in place.

""You worry about the wind blowing off the roof,"" Tener said of the main concerns for any home during a hurricane. ""You worry about the rain. And you worry about flooding.""

Anchored deep into the ground, the home also includes flood vents to relieve water pressure and protect the foundation. With these features, the house is rated to withstand 190-mile-per-hour winds — a very strong Category 5 hurricane.

""The inspector, when he came and inspected, he says, 'If we have a hurricane, I'm coming here,'"" Tener said.

A different kind of builder

Tener's home was built by Deltec Homes, a family-run company based in Asheville, North Carolina. The company has built more than 5,000 homes around the world, many designed specifically for resilience in extreme weather.

""We're taking that great shape and we're pairing it with amazing materials,"" said Matt Oblinsky, Deltec's lead engineer. The company estimates its homes cost about 10% more than traditional construction, but they often fare far better in storms. ""We're 99% successful,"" Oblinsky said of the homes' performance in past hurricanes. But he adds a note of caution: ""There's no such thing as a hurricane-proof home. We're very careful to say these are hurricane-resistant.""

Testing the limits

At the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) in South Carolina, engineers are working to make both new and existing homes more resilient. Using a massive wall of over 100 fans, the institute can simulate a Category 3 hurricane to test how well homes hold up under intense conditions.

In essence, IBHS builds homes and then destroys them.

And we do it all in the name of science,"" said Sarah Dillingham, senior meteorologist at IBHS.

The tests often reveal the vulnerabilities that can lead to catastrophic damage.

""Your roof is your first line of defense,"" Dillingham said. ""And it is what helps hold everything together in your home.""

She recommends storm-ready upgrades like high-impact windows, reinforced doors, and — crucially — wind-rated garage doors. ""Your garage door is your biggest opening of your home,"" she said. ""Because when wind gets in, it will find the weakest link.""

Longterm savings

For Tener, investing in a storm-resilient home has paid off financially as well. He even canceled his optional flood insurance saving him $12,000 per year.

""You put a little more money into it and it lasts forever,"" he said. ""It pays off in the long run.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/08/dc5b9fb7-3111-4ba3-b18a-4e8715751b4a/thumbnail/1200x630/d9e98a4e0dc4cfc3bf7cc663eadc7c60/f5-hurricane-homes-transfer-frame-2013.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 00:01:23.543838

The up to 11 gigawatt (GW) facility in Amarillo powered by nuclear, natural gas, and renewable energy, is planned near the Department of Energy's Pantex nuclear weapons plant and in partnership with Texas Tech University.

Fermi said in its application at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the regulator made public on July 8, that it is engaging in talks with many Big Tech companies, known as ""hyperscalers,"" on letters of intent and term sheets, or preliminary documents that are usually non-binding.

The application said that the hyperscalers would be tenants, apparently meaning they would not own part of the plants. Fermi did not immediately answer questions about financial arrangements being discussed with Big Tech companies or which or how many hyperscalers it is in talks with.

The last two reactors built in the U.S. were AP1000, completed in Vogtle, Georgia. They cost a total of more than $30 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Those plants were delayed by years and came in billions of dollars above projected costs. But nuclear backers say lessons learned should cut construction time and final costs of the next AP1000 reactors.

Fermi said in the application that the nuclear complex, which it calls the Donald J. Trump Generating Plant, will be eligible for financing from the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office. The only time the president tapped the LPO in his first term was for the Vogtle plants.

The company said other plans to finance construction and operation include equity capital contributions from institutional infrastructure and real estate investors, structured bond offerings, and clean energy tax credits.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing.
“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT.
Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars.
The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars.","A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates that battery electric cars sold today in Europe emit nearly 4 times less greenhouse gases over their lifetime than gasoline cars.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing. According to new ICCT research, battery electric cars sold today produce 73% less life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than their gasoline counterparts — even when factoring in production. That’s a 24% improvement over our 2021 estimates. In contrast, other powertrains, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, show only marginal or no progress in reducing their climate impacts.

The study, a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of all major powertrain types, reinforces earlier findings: only battery electric cars can deliver the large-scale emission cuts needed to address Europe’s most polluting transport mode. Passenger cars account for nearly three-quarters of the sector’s emissions.

“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT. “This progress is largely due to the fast deployment of renewable electricity across the continent and the greater energy efficiency of battery electric cars.”

By 2025, renewable energy sources are expected to account for 56% of electricity generation in Europe, an 18-point increase compared with 2020. The EU’s Joint Research Centre projects this share will increase further in the next decade, to 86% by 2045. Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars. In contrast, the fuels mix used by internal combustion engine cars will continue to mainly rely on fossil fuels, as the availability and price of alternative fuels remains uncertain.

Other technologies continue to lag behind battery electric vehicles in terms of life-cycle emission reductions. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars offer only 20% and 30% lower lifetime emissions than gasoline, respectively. This is also because plug-in hybrids are found to be driven less on electricity than previously assumed. While hybridization offers some benefits, these reductions are relatively small when compared with the emissions savings of battery electric cars—and they are not sufficient to meet the long-term climate targets.

The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. This pathway can also offer significant emissions reduction (79%) compared with gasoline cars—but only when using renewable electricity-based hydrogen, which is currently not produced and available at scale in Europe. In contrast, fuel cell electric cars run on hydrogen produced from natural gas, which corresponds to almost the entirety of hydrogen available today, allowing only a 26% reduction of life-cycle emissions compared with gasoline cars.

Addressing misuse of data in the EV debate

Misinformation and selective use of data have generated confusion regarding the climate credentials of electric vehicles. The ICCT analysis provides transparency on the impact of a selection of flawed assumptions, such as not accounting for the development of the grid during the lifetime of vehicles and using non-representative data on vehicle fuel consumption and lifetime.

One common claim is that electric vehicles have higher emissions associated with battery manufacturing. While manufacturing emissions for battery electric cars are roughly 40% higher than for gasoline cars, the ICCT’s research shows that this initial “emissions debt” is typically offset after around 17,000 kilometers of driving, usually within the first one to two years of use in Europe.

“We hope this study brings clarity to the public conversation, so that policymakers and industry leaders can make informed decisions,” said Dr. Georg Bieker, ICCT Senior Researcher. “We’ve recently seen auto industry leaders misrepresenting the emissions math on hybrids. But life-cycle analysis is not a choose-your-own-adventure exercise. Our study accounts for the most representative use cases and is grounded in real-world data. Consumers deserve accurate, science-backed information.”

The ICCT analysis covers the greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle and battery production and recycling, fuel and electricity production, fuel consumption, and maintenance. Its methodology also accounts for the development of the electricity mix along the lifetime of vehicles, as well as real-world usage rather than official test values to estimate fuel and electricity consumption, which is key to assessing plug-in hybrid emissions.

Solar Stocks Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.","Solar stocks retreated Tuesday after President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday ending subsidies for green energy sources. The Department of Energy released a corresponding report the same day warning of a major spike in blackouts by 2030 due to the retirement of coal-fired plants.

The White House on Monday released the new executive order that eliminates subsidies for ""unreliable"" green energy sources, like wind and solar. The order claims that such projects displace ""affordable, reliable"" dispatchable domestic energy sources, which ""compromises our electric grid."" Dispatchable energy sources include conventional energy sources like fossil fuels. President Trump's announcement claims that reliance on green subsidies threatens national security by making the U.S. dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries.

Energy Executive Order

""Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation,"" the order reads.

The executive order aims to eliminate taxpayer-funded green energy as well as support for green energy sources and supply chains built in or controlled by ""foreign adversaries."" The EO also builds on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by strengthening repeals and modifications to wind, solar and green energy tax cuts.

The Secretary Of Treasury has been ordered to within 45 days terminate clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities as part of the Internal Revenue Code. There are some additional ""beginning of construction"" revisions, including restricting safe harbor provisions unless a ""substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

During that time period, the Department of the Interior will determine if wind and solar facilities have been given any preferential treatment compared to dispatchable energy sources. The Secretary of the Interior will then revise any regulations or policies to eliminate any such preferences for wind and solar.

The Treasury and Interior departments will submit their findings to the president after the 45 day period in order to plan for the next steps.

Need For New Energy

Meanwhile, the Department of Energy released a report on Monday warning that blackouts in the U.S. could increase 100x by 2030 ""if the U.S. continues to shutter reliable power sources and fails to add additional firm capacity."" Firm capacity refers to natural gas plants, coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants, which do not rely on variable sources like wind and sunlight.

The department warned that the status quo is ""unsustainable"" with growing electricity demand from AI and data centers. The U.S. currently plans for 104 gigawatts (GW) of power generation plant retirements, to be replaced by 209 GW of new energy generation by 2030. But only 22 of those new GW come from what the DOE deems firm generation sources.

The DOE wrote this could lead to significant outages when weather conditions do not accommodate wind and solar generation. Wind and solar facilities increasingly use batteries and other energy storage strategies in order to save their generated power supply and extend availability.

The DOE's model predicts annual outage hours could increase from ""single digits today to more than 800 hours per year."" Even without retirements, the model found outage risks in ""several regions"" would rise more than 30-fold during the forecast period, meaning ""the queue alone cannot close the dependable-capacity deficit.""

Solar Stocks

Morgan Stanley in a Tuesday research note wrote that energy companies AES (AES) and NextEra Energy (NEE) may be the most affected by the executive order, The Fly reported. The firm noted that the EO directs agencies to adjust construction guidelines for tax credit eligibility, implement FEOC restrictions and remove preferential policies for renewables from the Department of Interior. The order targets clean tech, solar stocks and other renewable developers the most, primarily AES and NextEra. It looks ""less meaningful"" for the likes of GE Vernova (GEV), Bloom Energy (BE), Plug Power (PLUG), First Solar (FSLR) and Fluence Energy (FLNC).

RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker noted that the plan to curtail renewables does not come as a surprise following commentary from members of the House Freedom Caucus last week, according to The Fly. Tucker expects more pressure on the sector as the order leaves the solar industry in another state of limbo while awaiting the Treasury interpretation. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how the Trump administration plans to redefine the ""beginning of construction.""

Solar Stocks

Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.

AES stock fell nearly 4%. First Solar and Array Technologies (ARRY) both tumbled almost 7%.

NextEra slid 3%.

SolarEdge (SEDG) pared its Tuesday declines to around 1%, while GE Vernova eased slightly.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.
More stories about chemical recycling","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn rules first proposed by the Biden administration that addressed chemical recycling and had attracted significant industry opposition.

In a document set to publish July 9, the current Trump administration-led EPA said it is withdrawing “significant new use rules,” or SNURs, proposed in June 2023 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). These rules would have required companies that intend to “process any of 18 specific chemical substances derived from plastic waste for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity” to allow the agency to assess risks and regulate the significant new use if needed.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

During the extended public comment period for the 2023 proposal, chemical recycling firm Brightmark suggested additional time for stakeholders to consider “a number of key terms and potential effects of the proposed rule which would merit additional clarification.”

In its comments at the time, Freepoint Eco-Systems, which has been involved in several chemical recycling projects, said the rules put undue administrative burdens on industry, and asserted there were inconsistencies between the policy and the EPA’s mission, including that:

Imposing regulatory obstacles for realistic recycling scenarios runs counter to EPA’s stated objective of developing a circular economy for plastics.

Focusing on feedstock purity deviates from EPA’s approach to regulating chemicals under TSCA.

Michigan-based Dow cited in its comments the lack of a de minimis level for impurities, which “makes analytical testing and quantification impractical.” The company recommended EPA specify the chemicals of concern and identify a content threshold, among other suggestions for increasing clarity.

Ironically, the 2023 proposal purported to be addressing a lack of clarity surrounding pyrolysis, the most common method of chemical recycling: “As a result of recent market trends, especially with respect to the increased processing of waste plastics, the EPA received several inquiries about OSWI (other solid waste incineration) units and the applicability of OSWI regulations to pyrolysis/combustion units for a variety of process and feedstock type,” the proposal stated. “Based on these requests and the absence of a statutory definition of pyrolysis in the CAA (Clean Air Act), the Agency believed that there was considerable confusion in the regulated community regarding the applicability of OSWI to pyrolysis/combustion units. Moreover, the term ‘pyrolysis/combustion’ is not defined in the current OSWI regulation, nor is it included in the definition of ‘Institutional waste incineration unit.'”

In comparison, no official company comments were submitted during the public comment period for a 2020 proposal from the Trump EPA that, among other issues, sought to remove the reference to “pyrolysis/combustion units” from the OSWI definition of ‘‘municipal waste combustion unit.” However, the agency “received significant adverse comments on that revision,” largely from environmental and tribal groups, the agency said in its own withdrawal in 2023.

Plastics makers applaud withdrawal

In a statement, Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, said the rules “imposed unnecessary burdens and hindered investments in the advanced recycling industry.”

Eisenberg went on to say the SNURs lacked the required scientific basis required under TSCA, exceeded EPA’s authority by attempting to regulate feedstock impurities, and “failed to recognize the thermal and chemical transformation processes — such as pyrolysis — that can remove these impurities during the advanced recycling process.”

In a February 2025 blog post, Eisenberg lauded the first Trump administration for its “great progress on updating and clarifying federal policy to treat the re-manufacture of plastic (and other materials) like similar manufacturing processes.” He urged the current EPA to re-introduce its proposed regulations from 2020, adding that “companies need regulatory certainty if they’re going to invest in technologies and facilities designed to last for decades” and “there are few more surefire paths to stifle innovation than ambiguous regulations.”

Recycling industry stakeholders have expressed similar concerns about inconsistency and uncertainty in how chemical recycling will be handled amid federal administration changes and state-level initiatives that are creating a patchwork of regulations.

For example, as California works to finalize regulations for its extended producer responsibility law for packaging, proposed procedures for handling new and emerging technologies — including chemical recycling — have drawn debate, especially from environmental groups. One recent draft placed the responsibility on the requesting facility to prove a new technology meets state requirements.

Recycling stakeholders in both Europe and the U.S. have struggled to advance chemical recycling projects, citing legislative hurdles along with high capital expenditures among the headwinds they face.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.","The renewable energy industry faces a new series of hurdles after President Donald Trump signed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ into law on July 4. The law quickly phases out tax incentives for wind and solar power, which some experts warn could lead to project cancellations, job losses and higher electricity prices as well as power shortages.

The changes are a significant shift in policy as the Trump administration looks to end taxpayer support for renewable energy. In the lead-up to the bill’s passage, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright called incentives for wind and solar “wasteful and counterproductive.”

“The more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum stress and demand,” Wright wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post. Wright referenced a January winter storm in which the mid-Atlantic’s regional grid received only 4% of its power from renewables when electricity demand was high.

Opponents of the policy change, however, argue that it will slow renewable energy development at a time when the U.S. grid needs additional power generation to feed power-hungry data centers. In addition to causing project cancellations and job losses, renewable energy groups and industry analysts argue the new deadlines will limit new supply, forcing prices up and making the grid less reliable, especially during hot summers.

“This bill on the whole is negative for energy development in the United States, for manufacturing, and for just everyday families and consumers,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director focused on federal policy at the advocacy group Advanced Energy United.

How did the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ change renewable energy incentives?

The tax credits allow companies to earn a small reward — typically less than 1 cent per kilowatt-hour — for power generated by renewable energy sources. Once a new wind or solar installation begins providing electricity to the grid, the companies can claim the tax credits for the next 10 years.

Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, companies that began construction by 2033 would qualify for 10 years of credits once they started operating. The new law shortens the deadline and adds a requirement for the project to begin providing power to the grid. Now, projects that begin construction within the next 12 months have until 2030 to begin operations. Any projects that start construction after July 4, 2026, or those already under construction, need to be operational by the end of 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

How will the deadlines affect renewable energy?

Godfrey said project development usually takes two to four years before construction of new wind or solar projects begin. In that time, projects can be held up by local or federal permitting processes and lawsuits.

As a result, Godfrey said there are projects “in active development right now that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year.” The new deadlines threaten to “cut those projects off at the knees,” he said.

Construction can take as little as six months for some solar projects or several years for large offshore wind, Godfrey said. Even once construction is finished, Godfrey added that projects must be connected to the grid before being deemed truly operational. That lengthy process, called interconnection, is controlled not by the renewable energy companies but by regional grid operators.

“The vast majority of these project developers are looking to outside capital in order to go about financing their projects,” Godfrey said. Without certainty that the projects will qualify for tax credits, he expects a significant number of financers will pull out of projects already underway.

Will the grid become less reliable?

Michael Keyser is the CEO of the National Renewables Cooperative Organization, where he helps local electric cooperatives around the country adopt renewable energy and other emerging technologies. In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Keyser said he is skeptical about dire predictions of cost increases and grid reliability issues.

While he acknowledged that some ongoing projects may not qualify for tax credits, he said that changing the long-term incentives away from wind and solar is a “shift that we needed.”

The Big Beautiful Bill keeps the window to qualify for tax credits open longer for clean energy sources like nuclear, hydropower, geothermal and batteries, which are not dependent on weather conditions. Keyser said electric co-ops are increasingly leaning toward these technologies — especially batteries — and other “dispatchable” resources that provide power to the grid whenever it’s needed.

“It’s time for [wind and solar] to stand on their own two feet,” Keyser said.

Doug Lewin, an energy expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power Newsletter, agreed that the grid needs clean dispatchable power, but he sees a danger in “hamstringing” renewables.

In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Lewin noted that dispatchable technologies, such as natural gas and nuclear, have even longer planning and construction timelines than wind and solar. In the immediate future, the grid needs more power, and solar is the fastest-growing energy source.

The new law, Lewin said, lacks “any sort of logical, sensible vision for how we’re going to grow power.”

Another source of uncertainty for renewable energy comes from the “foreign entities of concern” rule, a part of the law that places limits on the number of components companies can source from China, Russia, Iran and a few other nations. The exact guidelines have not yet been written, but on Monday, July 7, President Trump issued an executive order, giving the Treasury Department 45 days to finalize a rule.

Lewin said the policies amount to “choking out supply,” which he said could have dire consequences. “

“Higher prices and a whole lot more conservation alerts, energy emergencies, and the occasional rolling outage. That’s what we’re looking at over the next few years,” he said.

WITH THE SWEEP OF A PEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY ON NOTICE.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.

AND A NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER DEMANDS AGENCIES “RAPIDLY ELIMINATE THE MARKET DISTORTIONS,” TRUMP SAYS THESE SUBSIDIES CAUSE.

ENERGY SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT HAS CALLED THESE TAXPAYER INCENTIVES “WASTEFUL AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.”

BUT THOSE FOR INCENTIVES SAY THE START AND STOP FOR THE INDUSTRY IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, TOO.

BACK IN 2022, LAWMAKERS EXTENDED THE DECADES-OLD SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR AND WIND WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT.

UNDER THAT LAW, ENERGY COMPANIES HAD THROUGH 2032 TO START CONSTRUCTION TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES. ONCE A QUALIFIED SOLAR OR WIND FARM WAS GENERATING POWER, THE COMPANY COULD CLAIM A TAX CREDIT ON THAT RENEWABLE POWER FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,” NOW LAW, SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENS THAT TIME FRAME.

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT BEGIN WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS HAVE UNTIL 2030 TO GET ONLINE.

EVERYONE ELSE MUST BE GENERATING POWER BY THE END OF 2027 TO CASH IN.

ADVANCED ENERGY UNITED’S HARRY GODFREY SAYS THE TIMELINE WILL PUT SOME PROJECTS IN A TOUGH SPOT. THAT’S BECAUSE IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS OF PLANNING BEFORE CONSTRUCTION EVEN STARTS.

“You could have projects that are in active development right now, that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year,” said Godfrey. “The passage and enactment of this law did mean that those projects got cut off at the knees.”

BUT MICHAEL KEYSER FROM THE NATIONAL RENEWABLES COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION SAYS SOLAR AND WIND HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH HELP FROM TAXPAYERS.

“These technologies have had 20 years’ worth of subsidies and it’s time for them to stand on their own two feet if they’re going to exist,” he said.

KEYSER SAYS HE’D PREFER TO SEE FEDERAL INVESTMENT SHIFT TO POWER SOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AROUND THE CLOCK.

In 1977, President Carter issued an Executive Order4 (Carter EO) directing CEQ to “[i]ssue regulations to Federal agencies for the implementation of the procedural provisions of [NEPA]” and stipulated some of the requirements to be incorporated therein. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued EO 141545 rescinding the Carter EO and directing CEQ “to issue guidance on implementing NEPA and to propose rescinding the NEPA implementing regulations.”6 At this direction, CEQ rescinded its regulations implementing NEPA, concluding that “it may lack authority to issue binding rules on agencies in the absence of the now-rescinded” Carter EO.7

Grid Faces Urgent Reliability Challenges Amid AI-Driven Load Growth and Plant Retirements","A new report by the U.S. Department of Energy provides a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy and reliability of the U.S. electric grid and warns that without urgent reforms and investment, the U.S. electric grid will be unable to support the nation’s economic ambitions, particularly in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and digital infrastructure. The report responds to recent executive orders emphasizing the need for a uniform, data-driven approach to evaluating grid reliability, particularly in the face of accelerating power plant retirements and surging electricity demand from data centers and AI applications.

Key findings include:

Grid Reliability at a Crossroads: The report finds that the current trajectory of plant retirements, coupled with insufficient additions of firm, dispatchable generation, places the S. grid at significant risk of widespread outages by 2030. This risk is compounded by rapid load growth, especially from data centers supporting AI and digital infrastructure.

AI and Data Center Load Growth: Electricity demand from data centers represents a major new source of load. This growth is concentrated in key regions such as PJM, ERCOT, and the West and cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.

Retirements Outpacing Reliable Additions: By 2030, 104 GW of generation (primarily coal and natural gas power plants) is slated for retirement, while only 22 GW of new firm baseload generation is expected to be added. The majority of new generation will come from intermittent sources (solar and wind), which do not provide the same reliability benefits as traditional baseload plants.

Risk of Outages Increases Dramatically: Under a scenario where all announced retirements occur, the report projects a 100-fold increase in annual hours of lost load, with some regions facing the possibility of losing up to 43% of hourly load during extreme events. Even if retirements are avoided, reliability risks remain elevated in several regions.

Regional Vulnerabilities: The analysis highlights that PJM, SPP, ERCOT, and SERC are particularly exposed to reliability shortfalls, especially during winter peaks. In contrast, regions such as ISO-NE and NYISO, which are not projected to see significant AI/data center load growth, remain relatively robust.

Modernization and Data Sharing Needed: The report underscores the inadequacy of traditional resource adequacy metrics and calls for modernized, granular approaches that account for the frequency, magnitude, and duration of outages. Enhanced regional collaboration and data exchange are identified as critical to effective grid planning and risk mitigation.

Solar power is reaching ever higher shares in some of the world’s largest power systems, but batteries promise to take this to the next level. Advances in technology and price reductions for both batteries and solar mean that solar power is no longer constrained to the daytime, but can deliver power 24 hours a day across the whole year. One of my favourite pieces published in June was an investigation into how 24/365 solar can already be a reality with today’s technology.

Ember also reported on the need for more ambitious grid planning if countries in Europe want to compete in the growing race for AI data centers – a topical issue right now. Another favourite June report described how electrification — the process of moving from fossil fuels to electricity — can fundamentally change the game and move us faster towards a clean energy future. It’s a brilliant read!

My pick for June’s chart of the month is taken from our analysis of the EU’s final National Energy and Climate Plans. One of Ember’s data viz experts, Reynaldo Dizon, took inspiration from the circular layout of the EU Council’s meeting room in Brussels and its vibrant carpet (designed to give equal visual weight to all 27 Member States) to provide a fitting visual metaphor presenting national target data on common ground.

The graphic reveals that most EU countries still lack adequate or complete data for critical aspects of the energy transition. Many targets are missing entirely or rely on outdated scenarios, limiting the EU’s ability to coordinate effectively and deliver on its climate goals.

You can see more of Ember’s best graphics from June in Datawrapper’s recent Data Viz Dispatch blog, which showcases some of the best data visualizations produced by newsrooms and other organisations from around the world.

China reached a major milestone in April with more than a quarter of its electricity coming from wind and solar – a level that was maintained in May, according to the latest data. China installed 93 GW of solar in May, which is roughly equivalent to the total solar capacity that Germany — the world’s sixth largest solar generator — has ever installed.

So far this year, China’s increase in clean power has been large enough to meet and exceed demand growth, resulting in a fall in fossil generation of 2.6% in January to May compared to the same period in 2024.

Scientists are worried what comes next,"Andrew Freedman, Ella Nilsen",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/climate/doe-climate-contrarians-trump,"The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.
He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.
CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE.
Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.
“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN.","The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. Each were given positions in the Energy Department, which is led by Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas fracking executive.

The researchers are John Christy and Roy Spencer, both of whom are research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, and Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.

Koonin previously served at DOE during the Obama administration, and earlier was a scientist for the oil and gas giant BP. He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.

The hirings were first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by CNN.

In the Energy Department’s internal employee directory, Koonin is listed as a “special government employee,” Christy is listed as “expert” and Spencer a “consultant,” according to an agency source familiar with the matter. All three are listed as being under the office of Energy Secretary Wright, the source confirmed.

The Energy Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the hires of the three men, as well as questions on what they were working on at DOE and how long they would be there.

CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE. Christy told CNN in an emailed response that he was not on the Energy Department’s payroll and was “just here to help as needed.”

Koonin, a theoretical physicist, served as the undersecretary for science at DOE under the Obama administration. He is the author of the 2021 book, “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters.”

The Trump administration is currently working on overturning a 2009 federal scientific finding that planet-warming pollution poses a threat to public welfare, which underpins many regulations designed to curb the nation’s pollution. That effort is being led by the Environmental Protection Agency, but is likely to involve other agencies, including the Department of Energy.

In addition, the second Trump administration has taken a hatchet to public spending on climate science research, proposing to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s research activities altogether while making cuts at other agencies as well.

The Energy Department employs numerous climate scientists and houses some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, which are used in part for modeling future global warming and its impacts.

Christy and Spencer have long maintained that satellite data does not show the same trends and extent of global warming as surface weather data and have used that to poke holes in the mainstream scientific data.

The Trump administration recently let go of hundreds of scientists who were beginning to work on the next iteration of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, which includes input from all climate-related federal agencies.

In recent weeks, the administration took down past iterations of these climate assessments, which are the most authoritative reports on how climate change will affect the US. It also shut down the educational website, climate.gov, and laid off its staff.

While the scope of their work is currently unclear, some prominent climate scientists are concerned Christy, Spencer and Koonin will be working on an alternative version of the next National Climate Assessment, which would be far more slanted to fringe views on the causes and consequences of global warming.

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, told CNN the hires signal an effort by DOE to arrive at a predetermined result.

“Hiring Koonin, Spencer, and Christy is not just irregular, it’s a recognition that none of the normal channels would not give them the answer they want,” Dessler said. “This seems to be a thread running through this administration. They don’t seek out legitimate expert opinion; instead, they find people to give them the answer they want.”

Christy suggested in his email to CNN that he wasn’t involved with either the national climate assessment or efforts to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding.

“I don’t know what is happening with the National Climate Assessment or the Endangerment Finding,” he wrote.

Dessler noted that Koonin, Christy and Spencer are well-known for making value judgements in their supposedly scientific assessments as well as cherry picking data, and the language they use tends to be in the personal-opinion space, rather than the science space.

“There’s also a lot of ‘I’m not convinced’ on areas that everyone else in the field is convinced by (‘I’m not convinced climate models are any good’). That’s not really a scientific argument,” Dessler said.

Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.

“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN. “While it’s useful to assess a variety of views, specifically seeking out and elevating fringe views that are not supported by the vast majority of the scientific research on a subject is deeply problematic.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20250708-koonin-christy-spencer.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-07-08 19:15:21.015247

July 8 (Reuters) – U.S. power consumption will hit record highs in 2025 and 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its short-term energy outlook on Tuesday.

The EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,189 billion kilowatt hours in 2025 and 4,278 billion kWh in 2026, up from a record 4,097 billion kWh in 2024.

Those demand increases come in part from data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, and as homes and businesses use more electricity and less fossil fuels for heat and transportation.

The EIA forecast 2025 power sales will rise to 1,517 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,474 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,052 billion kWh for industrial customers.

Those forecasts compare to all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,434 billion kWh in 2024 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

The EIA said natural gas’ share of power generation would slide from 42% in 2024 to 40% in 2025 and 2026. Coal’s share will rise from 16% in 2024 to 17% in 2025 before sliding to 15% in 2026 as renewable output rises.

The percentage of renewable generation will rise from 23% in 2024 to 25% in 2025 and 26% in 2026, while nuclear power’s share will slide from 19% in 2024 to 18% in 2025 and 2026, according to the outlook.

The EIA projected gas sales in 2025 would rise to 13.1 billion cubic feet per day for residential consumers, 9.8 bcfd for commercial customers and 23.5 bcfd for industrial customers, but fall to 35.8 bcfd for power generation.

That compares with all-time highs of 14.3 bcfd in 1996 for residential consumers, 9.6 bcfd in 2019 for commercial customers, 23.8 bcfd in 1973 for industrial customers and 36.9 bcfd in 2024 for power generation.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects.
But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.
The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.
The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago.","President Donald Trump is wasting no time hastening the demise of green energy tax credits — in keeping with the big, beautiful bargain he made with conservative Republicans.

The deal with Republican holdouts to end incentives for wind and solar power paved the way for passage of Trump’s mega-tax-and-spending bill. Trump’s July 4 signature on the bill completed the legislative assault on the Inflation Reduction Act’s subsidies for renewable energy.

But just how quickly the White House turned a handshake deal with House hard-liners into a presidential order — almost overnight — is notable, Christa Marshall reports.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects. It directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to look for ways in which wind and solar are getting preferential treatment. And it gives Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 45 days to implement provisions in the law aimed at preventing projects from partnering with “foreign entities of concern.”

That means primarily China, the globe’s dominant source of solar and battery technology.

The deadlines are tight. Wind and solar projects receive tax credits as long as they start construction by mid-2026, while projects that start later would need to be placed into service by 2027. In comparison, nuclear and geothermal resources have until 2033 to obtain tax credits.

Promises made, promises kept

Trump’s eagerness to make good on his promise to Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other budget hawks fits neatly with his disdain for Biden-era climate policy. Trump has rebuked the previous administration’s goal of shutting down coal plants in favor of carbon-free wind and solar generation, which he recently called “windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK.’”

Monday’s order to Treasury and Interior is also striking for another reason: The famously transactional president isn’t always known for holding his ground on big policy announcements.

Wall Street investors started using the term TACO (“Trump Always Chickens Out”) after Trump repeatedly backed away from threats and deadlines for slapping high tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The president is walking back a pause on the delivery of U.S. weapons to Ukraine in the war against Russia.

And last month’s bombing of Iran — raising the possibility of deeper U.S. involvement in a Middle East war — came despite the president’s boasts of keeping Americans out of foreign entanglements.

After last weekend’s tragic rains and floods in Texas, which took the lives of more than 100 people, including 27 kids at a Christian summer camp for girls, the seriousness of the administration’s on-again, off-again talk of abolishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency faces a real-world test, as do Trump’s cuts at the National Weather Service.

But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.

Supreme Court says Trump can order mass firings

The Supreme Court gave Trump the go-ahead today to launch his plan to fire thousands of federal workers, write Josh Gerstein and Hassan Ali Kanu.

The high court’s unsigned order grants the administration’s emergency appeal to enforce a February executive order that instructed agencies to carry out “reductions in force.” The justices said they were not assessing the legality of agency layoff plans, and litigation over the downsizing efforts is sure to continue.

The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.

Help wanted

The National Weather Service still hasn’t posted job ads for vacant positions in depleted forecast offices around the country, Daniel Cusick writes.

The agency has lost nearly 600 employees in recent months, as the administration fired probationary employees and made early retirement or buyout offers. Those vacancies are now in the spotlight after catastrophic floods in Texas killed more than 100 people, including dozens of children.

The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago. A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the weather service, said the process to post job ads “is currently underway.”

Meanwhile, experts are warning that Trump’s upcoming cuts to weather and disaster spending — including warning systems and flood projects — could mean new risks for areas around the country, write Scott Waldman and Chelsea Harvey.

“Lives are going to be lost, property is going to be damaged,” said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator under former President Joe Biden.

Emergency coal for AI?

The Department of Energy released a report Monday that lays the groundwork for keeping open coal and gas plants slated for closure, Peter Behr writes.

The analysis details the worst-case scenarios if the energy needs of artificial intelligence expand beyond the grid’s capacity — including weeks of power outages in some states by 2030. The report is widely seen as setting the stage for Trump to use an emergency provision of the Federal Power Act, written for wartime use, to order fossil fuel plants to keep running.

“Absent intervention, it is impossible for the nation’s bulk power system to meet the AI growth requirements while maintaining a reliable power grid and keeping energy costs low for our citizens,” said the report.

It could mark a serious win for the automaker, as it prepares to launch multiple next-generation affordable EVs, developed by its ""skunkworks"" teams.

The LFP supply chain has long been dominated by China. But American manufacturing of automotive-grade LFP cells marks a pivotal moment for the industry.

Ford’s upcoming electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan should still qualify for production credits under the Trump administration’s newly enacted legislation, the automaker said on Tuesday. If that happens, it could mark a major win and a turning point for the Dearborn automaker’s EV plans. The federal funding could help offset manufacturing costs for Ford’s next-generation affordable EVs.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford said in a statement. “The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit—a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness,” the automaker added. Reuters reported the news first.

The $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is already 60% complete and slated to begin producing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries next year. These batteries, which are cheaper and more durable than traditional lithium-ion packs (but less power-dense), will power Ford’s upcoming affordable EVs. The Marshall, Michigan, facility is the first in the U.S. to make automotive LFP batteries.

The LFP supply chain has for years been dominated by China. But LFP tech is now going global. Auto executives increasingly see it as key to making affordable, mass-market EVs.

""This is an opportunity for Ford to lead in this space and bring the technology back to the U.S.,"" Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems, told InsideEVs in an interview in June during a tour of the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan.

The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” now signed into law, dramatically undercuts federal support for clean energy. The clean vehicle tax credit is being phased out far earlier than expected, fuel economy rules have been rolled back and the Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to loosen its Multi Pollutant Emissions Criteria—again.

Still, incentives for domestic battery manufacturing remain intact, at least in some capacity. The rules are now stricter, requiring a higher share of raw materials to be sourced from within the U.S. But projects that were already under construction by the end of 2024, such as Ford’s LFP plant, are not affected under Section 45X of the advanced manufacturing credit, and therefore do not need to meet the tougher requirements.

Ford broke ground on the LFP plant back in 2023 and seems relatively shielded from the new restrictions under the newly passed spending bill. That's a relief for the company, as the plant has drawn scrutiny from Republican lawmakers over Ford’s licensing agreement with Chinese battery giant CATL, which some have alleged has ties to forced labor over in China.

But the automaker said the plant is key to bringing affordable EVs to the masses and to bring back LFP tech—which was invented at the University of Texas at Austin—to the U.S. It will support 1,700 manufacturing jobs when complete.

Plus, Ford has long maintained that the new battery plant is “Ford-owned” and “Ford-operated.” The CATL collaboration is merely a “legal fact” because of who owns the patents and the licensing deal which will allow for the technology to truly proliferate in the U.S.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/rKqbWE/s1/ford-blueoval-battery-park-michigan.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:13:37.026455

In the Chicago area and around the country, dealership owners are preparing for the cuts to go into effect in just a couple of months. The owners said they are already seeing changes in the market.

The federal tax credits, which are meant to get drivers behind the wheel of electric cars, end Sept. 30. The credits cut up to $7,500 off the price of a new electric car, and up to $4,000 off to a used car.

""The $7,500 incentive is fully 20% the price of this vehicle,"" said John Crane, who runs Hawk Auto Group, as he pointed out a Fiat 500E for sale on one of his lots.

The end of the federal tax credits for electric car purchases is a consequence of the massive tax and spending cut bill passed last week. Crane said the electric vehicles currently in stock will sell out, and then dealerships after that will only get supply to the tune of a handful a month.

""We're not going to order as many as we currently have in stock,"" he said.

Crane added that a $7,500 credit going away also amounts to a cost of about $200 more a month for the average consumer.

He said the result of all this is sure to be that a lot of people just won't buy electric cars anymore.

""The barrier to entry is going to be higher, and less people will be willing to take a chance,"" he said.

Hawk Auto Group, which has dealerships across Illinois, said the end of the tax credit will mean changes for them too.

""The $7,500 credit is beyond the scope of what a dealership could afford to make up,"" Crane said.

Meanwhile, the change is already making waves in the auto industry — to the point where some manufacturers aren't making as many electric cars.

""Nissan has pushed out production for some of their electric vehicles,"" Crane said, ""and you know, even at the high end, Maserati was planning on going all-electric, and now they're not going to do that at all.""

It is not just a couple of automakers reassessing plans for electric vehicles.

""Nearly all automakers have reassessed their product portfolio and are pushing their new entrants into electric vehicle segments further out, so they have more time to adjust what the real market is going to end up being without the incentive,"" said Crane.

John Truckenbrod is founder of Chicago-based EV Energy Group. He offered some perspective on the situation.

""Globally this year, one out of four cars sold will be electric,"" Truckenbrod said. ""Now, the United States isn't necessarily the leader in electric vehicles.""

The EV Energy Group installs different types of chargers — residential and commercial. He said the end to the tax credit may slow down electric vehicle purchases, but interest is not going anywhere.

""It will probably slow the market down, but it's not going to end the market,"" Truckenbrod said.

But what does the end to the tax credit mean for those who are shopping for a car. Regardless of whether interest is maintained, consumers may indeed see fewer all-electric vehicles on dealership lots.

""If price goes up, we expect sales to go down. It's very simple,"" said Crane. ""So that means we would have to stock a few less, and we'll probably be working more off an order-based system for electric vehicles in the future.""

(TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF) CEO told InvestorNews host Tracy Hughes, ticking off a string of recent hires: an operations veteran, a Ph.D. process-chemistry lead “who joined the team in the last two weeks,” and a project manager “who actually built an SX plant, both heavy and light.” Those additions anchor a company that—by design—intends to become, as Ryan put it, “very much an American story.”

Ucore’s ambitions rest on RapidSX™, a proprietary separation technology that has already logged “over 5,000 hours” on a Kingston, Ontario, demo line and just received a show-of-faith from the Pentagon. In May, the U.S. Department of Defense expanded its Other Transaction Agreement, layering US$18.4 million atop a previous US$4 million allocation. Ryan called it “about C$38 million added to the mix,” money earmarked for an 80,800-square-foot Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria, Louisiana, slated to start shipping separated oxides in the first half of 2026.

Armed with that federal endorsement, Ucore moved quickly to thicken its own war chest. A June financing added C$15.5 million, lifting available funds to “over $50 million.” The timing, Ryan said, avoided “summer doldrums” and the market’s “China on-again, off-again” anxiety, positioning the company to pursue only “strategic equity” going forward.

Location is its own hedge. Alexandria sits inside a foreign-trade zone, giving the plant tariff insulation for concentrates shipped up the Mississippi, whether from “Brazil, Australia,” or elsewhere. “Critical rares are needed,” Ryan noted, adding that the Louisiana build-out will be modular, scalable, and buffered from Gulf hurricanes yet within “good freight in, good freight out” corridors.

Kingston remains the company’s laboratory—now doubled in size—where engineers are exploring “oddball” feedstocks such as samarium-rich concentrates banned from export by China.

Meanwhile, the visitor log hints at downstream traction: “twenty-nine visitors” in 2024, including potential offtake partners seeking REEs for magnets and “other uses” beyond motors.

Shareholders can expect, in the next quarter, an engineering schedule for Louisiana, specifics on South American and Australian supply agreements, and “three- and four-prong partnerships” linking feedstock, processing, alloying, and end users. Ryan’s view is blunt: “You don’t just (want to) have one-off transactional relationships (because they) don’t do a whole lot for building out the complete supply chain.”

Dive Brief:

Detroit has launched a drone inspection pilot program for city-owned buildings that can identify energy-saving improvements and optimize performance.

The drones capture visible and thermal imaging of the building; an AI platform developed by Lamarr.AI processes the images and building analytics to create 3D models and energy simulations that help city officials identify thermal inefficiencies, assess structural conditions and optimize potential upgrades.

A partnership among Lamarr.AI, Detroit-based technology incubator Michigan Central and startup venture platform Newlab, the pilot “is a prime example of how public-private collaboration can unlock innovative solutions for cities,” said Tim Slusser, Detroit’s chief mobility officer, in a statement.

Dive Insight:

Detroit, the Michigan Department of Transportation, Michigan Central and Newlab in 2022 launched the Advanced Aerial Innovation Region as a real-world testbed for next-generation drone technologies “to move drone technology from concept to city-scale deployment,” according to a press release.

The number of use cases for drones in city operations is “phenomenally high,” said Matt Whitaker, director of mobility innovation platforms at Michigan Central.

Detroit had already established a transportation innovation zone to streamline permitting for new mobility solutions such as drones, and Michigan Central helped the city get Federal Aviation Administration permissions to fly the drones, Whitaker said.

For this project, Lamarr.AI, working with aerial photographers FlyGuys and drone operations management system Airspace Link, deployed drones to identify thermal deficiencies such as insulation gaps and potential water infiltration in three municipal buildings. It used the data to create 3D models it paired with energy simulations to pinpoint targeted upgrades that could reduce the three buildings’ HVAC energy use by up to 22%, according to the press release.

The final reports give the city a tiered approach to retrofitting the buildings, such as targeted weatherization at the curtain wall, replacement of specific failing windows, continuous wall insulation and roof enhancements.

“We are helping the city of Detroit, through the Office of Sustainability specifically, to identify vulnerabilities for cost and climate challenges,” said Lamarr.AI co-founder and CEO Tarek Rakha. “Our AI analyzes and categorizes building deficiencies and uses simulation to clearly state the return on investment once we identify an anomaly or a deficiency.”

Rakha said the combination of drones and its AI platform is “20 times faster, five to 10 times more affordable and 50% more accurate than [assessing thermal deficiencies by] regular means — including using drones in general because drones can collect data but not analyze it.”

The company’s technology can scan “a huge number of buildings in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost because we’re using our own AI analytics,” Rakha said. “That makes scaling quite accessible.”

We have updated this article to correct an error in the quote from Lamarr.AI co-founder and CEO Tarek Rakhaabout of the speed of the process. He said it’s 10 times faster.

Let alone [we don’t know] how that extreme weather is going to change over the years due to climate change,” said Di Liberto.
Meteorologists warn that it is important to have an emergency kit in case of flash floods.","From Texas to North Carolina, scientists say flash floods are not only becoming more frequent but also growing in intensity.

As of Tuesday, the devastating flash flooding in Texas has claimed the lives of over 100 people. This comes not even ten months after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina.

According to the National Weather Service, flash floods are the nation's number one storm-related killer.

“During Helene, they talked a lot about it being a once-in-a-thousand-year event or more,” Carl Schreck, senior research scholar with NCSU and NC Institute for Climate Studies, told News 13.

According to Climate Central, rainfall rates today are now 15% higher than in 1970.

""That's not taking into account climate change, where these events are starting to happen more frequently,"" Schreck added. ""So, the same rainfall today will have more moisture to work with and cause more rain than it would have 50 or 100 years ago.""

Scientists say climate change is one of the main causes. They say that as the planet warms, storms get stronger and rain gets heavier.

“A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture in it,” said Tom Di Liberto with Climate Central.

Climate Central reported that for every one degree of warming, the air can hold four percent more moisture, leading to heavier downfalls. WLOS Chief Meteorologist Jason Boyer says the landscapes of certain areas can also play a role. He broke down the difference between the flooding in Texas and Hurricane Helene.

“With the rainfall here in Western North Carolina, we were able to push it down into several different river stems and flush it. Even though we had flash flooding, it could have been much worse. In Texas, they only had the Guadalupe and Colorado River,” Boyer said.

But it is not just the floodwaters that pose a threat; they can cause a chain reaction of landslides and erosion.

“I think it’s clearly shown over the past couple of years that we are clearly not prepared. Let alone [we don’t know] how that extreme weather is going to change over the years due to climate change,” said Di Liberto.

Scientists say that to better prepare, people must be educated on the dangers of living by a river and listen to warnings when they are presented.

Meteorologists warn that it is important to have an emergency kit in case of flash floods.

An emergency kit should be stocked with food for at least three days, prescription medication and important papers such as insurance, birth certificates and licenses.",https://wlos.com/resources/media2/16x9/8256/986/0x430/90/a2f168f1-5a01-4cab-afa9-61992a418272-AP25188632711290.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:15:25.744486

“In 2023, domestic power plants alone released 1.4 billion metric tons of [carbon],” according to Callie Sharp, an associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago.
“If EPA finalizes this repeal, people will die preventable deaths,” Bender said in her comments at the hearing.
Power plant cooperatives and advocates including the US Chamber of Commerce testified later in the day, reiterating calls for cheaper and more affordable energy through the repeal of “costly” regulations.
“The carbon rule would cause the retirement of the entire coal fleet,” Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of America’s Power, said in her testimony.","Clean air and climate advocates urged the Environmental Protection Agency in public testimony Tuesday to scrap a proposal that would repeal strong limits on greenhouse gas emissions from the coal-fired power sector.

Officials from the EPA hosted multiple sessions of public comment during the day on a proposed repeal of all power plant carbon limits under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, the latest of which relied on carbon capture technology to drastically reduce planet-warming emissions.

The EPA plan marks a significant shift from the Biden administration, which finalized the current limits as an effort to reduce the climate and public health effects of air pollution from coal-fired power plants.

Citing the Biden-era rule as a burden on the development of domestic energy sources, the Trump administration’s proposal justifies the repeal by claiming that “fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

Advocates testifying at the Tuesday hearing lambasted that reasoning.

“In 2023, domestic power plants alone released 1.4 billion metric tons of [carbon],” according to Callie Sharp, an associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago. “This is more than the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of nearly every other nation on Earth, and is greater than the collective greenhouse gas emissions of over half of the world’s countries.”

Many of the speakers expressed disappointment that the hearing was only one day long, when the last power plant rules finalized under the Biden administration had such extensive comment opportunity. The agency set a 30-day deadline to submit comments on the rule by Aug. 8.

Laura Kate Bender, vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association and a hearing speaker, said in an email that the EPA staff were “as engaged as ever in listening to testimony,” but also echoed concerns about the single-day schedule.

“If EPA finalizes this repeal, people will die preventable deaths,” Bender said in her comments at the hearing.

Extending the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit: The bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years, through 2029 (prior to enactment, these credits would expire in 2027).
[1] There are similar restrictions applicable to the Section 45Q carbon capture credit and the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit.","On July 4, President Trump signed H.R.1—the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” referred to as the OBBB—into law. This sweeping tax and policy law, enacted through the process of budget reconciliation requiring a simple majority vote by Congress, carries significant implications for environmental funding, clean energy development, and climate-related programs administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as the tax code. Much of the provisions affect programs and funding originally authorized under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), which was former President Biden’s signature budget reconciliation bill. Below, we outline some of the key features of the OBBB environmental and energy provisions.

Environmental Provisions

In an effort to hit topline federal spending reductions, the OBBB includes funding cuts for environmental programs previously appropriated to the EPA. This includes rescinding unobligated balances for the following programs authorized under the IRA:

Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction fund (rescind unobligated balance of the $27 billion appropriated for nonprofit organizations to use for direct and indirect investment in various qualified environmental projects);

Environmental and climate justice block grants (rescind unobligated balance of the $2.8 billion for grants related to environmental and climate justice activities);

Environmental product declarations (rescind unobligated balance of the $250 million to develop and implement a program to standardize and increase transparency regarding environmental product declarations for construction materials that include assessments of GHG usage);

Funding for implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020 (rescind unobligated balance of the $38.5 million appropriated to carry out AIM Act goal to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including competitive grants to shift to lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants);

Renewable fuels standards under Clean Air Act § 211(o) (rescind unobligated balance of the $15 million for test/protocol development with respect to environmental and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive, procedures for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of a fuel, and the impacts of transportation fuels); and

GHG corporate reporting (rescind unobligated balance of the $5 million for enhanced standardization and transparency of corporate climate action commitments and plans to reduce GHG emissions).

The OBBB includes other fee- and royalty-related provisions to enact policy changes that seek to reduce burdens with domestic energy development, including:

Delay in methane emissions fee: OBBB delays a fee imposed by the IRA on certain methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources for 10 years, to 2034. This fee applies to excess emissions as defined in the IRA from facilities subject to EPA’s subpart W reporting under the greenhouse gas reporting program, unless eligible for an exemption. Congress rescinded EPA’s 2024 rule implementing the methane emissions fee by a Congressional Review Act resolution signed by President Trump in March 2025.

Expedited National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) review: The OBBB creates a new White House Council on Environmental Quality program in which a sponsor of a project requiring environmental review under NEPA can obtain expedited review by paying an optional fee—125% of the anticipated costs to prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement—to have the environmental assessment completed no later than 180 days after paying the fee and the environmental impact statement completed within a year of the date of publication of the notice of intent to prepare the environmental impact statement.

Tax Implications

The legislation has significant tax implications for industry sectors with environmental impacts. This includes:

Phasing out the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax credit: The Section 45X credit—which provides a tax credit for manufacturers of eligible components that are produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party—will terminate for wind components sold after 2027. The Section 45X credit applicable to other eligible components will be phased out in accordance with the original IRA phaseout schedule (with phaseout beginning in 2030), but the OBBB now imposes a commensurate phaseout schedule for the Section 45X credit applicable to critical minerals, which was previously excluded from any phaseout schedule under the IRA.

Phasing out the Section 45Y and Section 48E Clean Energy Production and Investment Tax Credits for Wind and Solar Projects: The Section 45Y and 48E credits—related to clean electricity production and investments, respectively—will terminate for qualifying wind and solar facilities that are not placed in service by the end of 2027, with the exception of projects that begin construction by July 4, 2026, (i.e., 12 months after the OBBB’s enactment). The termination cliff is not applicable to other technologies that are eligible for the Section 45Y credit or the Section 48E credit, such as qualifying energy storage technologies, which would remain subject to the original IRA phaseout schedule.

Implementing Prohibited Foreign Entity-Related Restrictions: The OBBB implements sweeping restrictions relating to “prohibited foreign entities” (or “PFEs”) for the Sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X credits,[1] disqualifying eligibility for such credits if the taxpayer is a PFE or if the taxpayer receives “material assistance” from a PFE. “Material assistance” is determined using a cost-based formula benchmarked against technology-specific thresholds. In respect of the Sections 45Y and 48E credits, the material assistance restrictions apply to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025, and in respect of the Section 45X credit, such restrictions generally apply to components manufactured in 2026 or later.

Terminating Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credits: The OBBB erminates the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production credit for projects on which construction begins after December 31, 2027. Significantly, the OBBB’s termination timeline is five years earlier than the current IRA sunset date for the Section 45V credit.

Extending the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit: The bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years, through 2029 (prior to enactment, these credits would expire in 2027). Additionally, credit eligibility for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is contingent on such fuel being exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and its emissions rates cannot be negative (with an exception for animal manure-derived transportation fuels).

Ending the tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs) and related infrastructure: The Section 30D Clean Vehicle credit—which allows consumers to obtain a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for used EVs—will now terminate on September 30, 2025. Additionally, the Section 30C credit for EV charging infrastructure will terminate after June 30, 2026.

Other Notable Energy Provisions

The OBBB contains other notable provisions related to the energy sector, including:

Increased royalties on oil and natural gas leases: The OBBB restores the pre-IRA royalty rates on oil and gas leases from 16.6% to 12.5%, and repeals the IRA-codified royalty imposed on methane produced from oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. The OBBB would also require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a minimum of four oil and gas lease sales of available land in nine western states per year, and 30 region-wide oil and gas lease sales over the next 15 years (at least two per year). It also removes Biden-era restrictions on leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.

Funding for critical minerals mining: Congress appropriated $5 billion to the Secretary of Defense for investments in critical minerals supply chains, as well as $2 billion to improve the S. stockpile of critical minerals through the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund.

S. petroleum reserves: $171 million is appropriated to the Department of Energy to acquire petroleum products for storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

“Energy Dominance” grant: $1 billion in funding is appropriated for the Department of Energy’s loan program to support various energy initiatives.

Next Steps

Federal activity now shifts to the individual agencies to implement the new law, including regulatory changes that will provide opportunities for public comment. Entities across manufacturing, energy, transportation, infrastructure, real estate, and other sectors should also watch for state-level environmental actions and funding opportunities as federal incentives wane.

Sidley Austin’s Environmental and Energy practices are closely tracking the progress of this law and related regulatory developments. We are available to advise clients on risk assessments and compliance protocols, and investment planning in response to the OBBB and the coming regulatory changes.

[1] There are similar restrictions applicable to the Section 45Q carbon capture credit and the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit.

By aligning bacterial cellulose (BC) fibers through a dynamic, rotational biosynthesis process, the team has created transparent, flexible, and ultra-strong sheets that rival metals and plastics in performance — without the environmental tradeoffs.

Published in Nature Communications, the research outlines a scalable, single-step method that uses controlled fluid flow to direct the growth of cellulose-producing bacteria. The result: nanofiber alignment in real time, producing biopolymer sheets with tensile strength up to 436 MPa, and 553 MPa when enhanced with boron nitride nanosheets — surpassing many synthetic composites in both strength and thermal conductivity.

From Disorder to Precision: Training Bacteria for Performance

Plastic pollution persists because synthetic polymers break down into harmful microplastics. Bacterial cellulose, one of Earth’s most abundant and pure biopolymers, offers a biodegradable alternative — and now, we’ve unlocked its full potential.

The challenge with bacterial cellulose has long been its random fiber orientation, which limits mechanical performance. By introducing a rotational bioreactor, the team leveraged fluid shear forces to align the motion of Novacetimonas hansenii, a cellulose-producing bacteria.

“Our approach involved developing a rotational bioreactor that directs the movement of cellulose-producing bacteria,” said M.A.S.R. Saadi, the study’s first author and a doctoral student at Rice. “This alignment significantly enhances the mechanical properties of microbial cellulose, creating a material as strong as some metals and glasses yet flexible, foldable, transparent and environment friendly.”

Building Multifunctionality into the Manufacturing Process

Beyond strength, the researchers infused hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) into the nutrient solution, enabling simultaneous material enhancement during biosynthesis. The resulting hybrid bionanocomposite offers three times faster heat dissipation than traditional BC — a promising feature for thermal management in green electronics.

“This dynamic biosynthesis approach enables the creation of stronger materials with greater functionality,” Saadi added. “The method allows for the easy integration of various nanoscale additives directly into the bacterial cellulose, making it possible to customize material properties for specific applications.”

The process is chemical-free, energy-efficient, and compatible with existing incubator equipment, making it immediately viable for industrial upscaling.

Tech Applications: From Circuit Boards to Thermal Shields

With its optical clarity, mechanical durability, and customizable nanoscale functionality, flow-aligned bacterial cellulose is poised to disrupt a wide range of markets:

Flexible electronics and displays

Heat-dissipating films in data centers and EVs

Biodegradable packaging with embedded conductivity

Textiles and wearable tech materials

Lightweight structural components

“The synthesis process is essentially like training a disciplined bacterial cohort,” Saadi explained. “Instead of having the bacteria move randomly, we instruct them to move in a specific direction, thus precisely aligning their cellulose production.”

A Biopolymer Designed for the Circular Economy

As the tech sector seeks low-impact alternatives to plastic films, PET layers, and synthetic polymers, this innovation arrives with high relevance for ESG-aligned industries.

According to First Street, ""We have spent nearly a decade advancing research in climate and flood risk modeling.","Western North Carolina homeowners are pushing back on climate risk labels they argue don't match reality.

News 13 Investigates talked with several homeowners who have raised concerns and the company behind the data to explore the broader impacts on property owners and home sales.

FOR SALE - LITTLE INTEREST

John and Laura Haldane have done their share of wandering across the globe.

“At our core, people are the same everywhere — we all love music, family, hugs, and dancing,” explained John, standing in front of a map of the globe with pins marking the couple’s travels.

The currents have always carried them back to the mountains.

“This has been such a special place in our hearts,” said John.

Recently, those winds shifted.

“I’m dragging my heels,” said John.

“We want the house to sell, but it was hard,” explained Laura. “Nibbles before it actually went on the market, and then almost nothing since,” said Laura.

A call to their realtor unraveled why they haven’t seen much traffic.

“The buyers' agent said the buyers were concerned about the high flood risk, and we were shocked,” said Laura.

Confused, they checked their listing on popular real estate websites.

CLIMATE RISK RATINGS

“It’s in very large print. We are a 10 out of 10 extreme risk for flooding,” said John about what they found.

It's a hard rating to swallow since during Hurricane Helene, rainfall maps showed that between 13 and 15 inches fell at their home over three days, and the property never flooded.

“I thought this was so obviously incorrect. It should be easy just to point out why it’s incorrect and get the information changed,” said Laura.

It has been anything but easy, and Brian Cagle, Allen Tate/Beverly-Hanks' regional vice president, said the Haldanes aren’t alone.

“We pulled some numbers in Waynesville, and we have 20 properties that are not in a flood zone, did not flood, and have very high ratings, so I don’t know why,” said Cagle.

IMPACT ON WNC MOUNTAINS

The rating comes from First Street Technology. Its climate risk ratings started in September on websites including Zillow, Realtor.com and Redfin, among others.

“We’re appreciative of their work and their efforts and their concern for climate change, that’s all great, but it has to be right. The data has to be accurate,” said Cagle, who has since reached out to the NC Realtors Board, which was looking into the matter.

In addition to the Haldanes, the LeGwins in Asheville, the Schrecks in Hendersonville, and the DeMerrits in Pisgah Forest reached out to News 13 when their 10 of 10 flood rating also ran buyers off.

We reached out to First Street Technology with their concerns. The company pointed us to their YouTube page, which explains their flood modeling. It uses physics versus statistics to predict heavier rainfalls now and 30 years from now.

“It’s actually simulating rainfall on this earth, how that rainfall moves across the surface, collects into streams and rivers, and moves downhill, basically,” said Dr. Ed Kearns, chief science officer for First Street Technology, in the on flood modeling.

Coupled with data from FEMA, NASA, USGS and the Army Corps of Engineers, the model generates a score, not just for a region, but for specific homes, according to First Street’s video.

The above graphic and image from the News 13 drone show why the Haldanes' question whether the data is accurate.

When checking neighboring properties above and below the Haldanes' lot, five were rated one out of 10, and two received nines for flood factors.

“Water flows downhill, so there’s no way that we can have polar opposite flood risks,” said Laura.

All four of the homeowners who reached out to News 13 had minimal flood risk in North Carolina's Flood Risk Information System. First Street's YouTube video also explained why the models differ.

“Unfortunately, that doesn’t tell the whole story because flood zones don’t capture heavy rainfall, and those FEMA flood zones are not capturing climate change,” said Dr. Kearns.

CAN YOU DISPUTE IT?

First Street's says: ""As a rule, we do not update factor scores based on individual requests or disputes.”

However, in an email, a spokesperson told News 13 they would review the addresses I shared, plus any FEMA letters of map amendments, elevation certificates, base flood elevation documents, and proof of new construction or updates not in public record that homeowners submitted.

The LeGwins sent both Zillow and First Street some of that data, but Zillow confirmed First Street’s assessment in a letter and said the climate risk feature will remain. The Haldanes got a similar response.

“Their policy is not to make changes,” said Laura of the email they received back from their complaint to First Street.

News 13 reached out to a local environmental scientist and geologist familiar with area flooding. After consulting debris flow maps, he didn’t understand the varying scores around the Haldanes' property.

The LeGwins' property is mapped at risk for a debris flow, but the Schrecks' Hendersonville property is out of the floodway. That is why the Land of the Sky Association of Realtors is encouraging home buyers not to just look at these scores.

“I would remind folks it’s a projection and that there are other modeling programs out there, so as with anything else, check multiple sources, visit the property and develop your own conclusions,” said realtor Rachel Brown.

Even First Street admits a property ranked 10 of 10 for extreme flooding may never flood, which home sellers say is frustrating.

News 13 is aware that several homeowners have filed complaints about First Street's data with the North Carolina Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division. They have reached out to First Street on the homeowners’ behalf.

News 13 also found nationwide complaints with the Better Business Bureau about First Street’s Data, with the responses that they don’t address individual concerns.

First Street has yet to get back to News 13 about the addresses we provided.

DISPUTE PROCESS:

According to First Street Technology, ""anyone can submit a dispute"" at .

First Street told News 13 the following:

""We want to assure you that every submission is reviewed to ensure data accuracy. In the rare instance that data is found to be incorrect or if appropriate supporting documentation is provided, we take prompt action to issue a response. If not, our system directs users to the following resources to help them better understand their score.""

Congressional Democrats are calling for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to reinstate 139 of the agency’s employees, who were recently put on administrative leave after signing a letter dissenting with its latest policies.

On Tuesday, several members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee claimed the action by President Donald Trump’s administration is illegal, since the employees are whistleblowers.

“Taking adverse actions against employees for making a protected disclosure — including investigating them and placing them on administrative leave — in a manner that deters others from coming forward is a textbook violation of the whistleblower Protection Act,” the lawmakers said in a letter sent to Zeldin.

The letter was signed by the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, as well as New York Reps. Paul Tonko and Yvette Clarke.

A group of Democratic lawmakers from Virginia and Maryland also spoke out against the action taken by Zeldin at a news conference on Tuesday.

“Zeldin and his Trump administration colleagues are taking taxpayer money and sabotaging the essential work that this agency does to protect public health,” said Rep. Don Beyer, who represents Virginia’s 8th District.

Beyer was joined by fellow Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, of the 11th District, as well as Maryland Reps. Glenn Ivey, who represents the 4th District, and April McClain Delaney, of the 6th District.

“These 139 (workers) stand up for the safety of the public, for the safety and protection of the environment, for the assistance and help of the American people; and the first thing they do is try to kick them out,” Ivey said. “It’s wrong, it’s retaliatory and we have to do everything we can to turn it around.”

EPA’s ‘zero tolerance’

When the EPA announced the employees were being put on administrative leave last week, it accused them of “unlawfully undermining” the administration’s agenda.

The employees had signed a “declaration of dissent,” arguing that the agency is failing to maintain its mission to protect public health and the environment.

The EPA said in a statement that it has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the president’s agenda. But employees were also told it was not a disciplinary action.

The EPA said the employees would be paid during their “temporary, non-duty” status for a period of two weeks, as an administration investigation was carried out.

Under Zeldin’s leadership, the EPA has reduced funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, proposed repealing rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions and undid a ban on a type of asbestos.

During a cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, Zeldin said the president’s “one big beautiful bill” that was approved by Congress last week delivered a “sledgehammer” to what he called the “green new scam,” which is what administration officials often call various environmental initiatives approved when former President Joe Biden was in office.

Zeldin touted various efforts to reduce spending in the agency.

“This is about us being good stewards of American tax dollars, without any apology or regret,” he said.

Key Takeaways Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance.
Tax credit buyers and investors should continue to carefully diligence projects to ensure that energy tax credit requirements are met.","On July 4th, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”), which included a phaseout of incentives for solar and wind generation projects. Projects must either begin construction within one year or be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit or the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit. The House’s version of the legislation required a more accelerated phaseout than the Act and only allowed projects that began construction within 60 days of enactment of the bill to be eligible for the tax credits. In discussions last week with House conservatives who favored the faster phaseout of solar and wind tax credits, which was not adopted in the Act, President Trump promised strict enforcement of the rules, including the beginning of construction requirements, for solar and wind projects to qualify for energy tax credits.

On July 7th, President Trump issued an Executive Order (“EO”) titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources. In the EO, the Trump Administration directs the Treasury Secretary to “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities” within 45 days following the enactment of the Act.

Beginning of Construction Rules

Specifically, the EO directs the Treasury Department to issue new and revised guidance for the beginning of construction requirements, which it states should prevent the “artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” and “restrict the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Many House conservatives disfavor the current IRS guidance provisions: the Five Percent Safe Harbor and the Physical Work Test. The Five Percent Safe Harbor allows energy projects to demonstrate “beginning of construction” by incurring at least five percent of the total project cost, even if the project isn’t completed within the same tax year. The Physical Work Test allows a taxpayer to establish “beginning of construction” by beginning physical work of a significant nature.

These “beginning of construction” tests are set forth in IRS Notices. Because IRS Notices are informal guidance and not formal guidance, the IRS may withdraw, amend, or issue notices at any time. Taxpayers may rely on the existing IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59, both specifically referenced in the Act, until Treasury and the IRS withdraw and/or issue new guidance.

The “beginning of construction” rules are important not only to retain eligibility for the credits past the termination date for the credit, but also to determine whether a project must meet the foreign entity of concern requirements set forth in the Act.

Foreign Entity of Concern Requirements

The EO also directs the Treasury Secretary to take “prompt action” to implement the enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions in the Act within 45 days following enactment. The complex FEOC provisions included in the Act limit the ability of “prohibited foreign entities,” as defined in the Act, to claim tax credits for qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology that begin construction after December 31, 2025. Taxpayers cannot claim these credits if they engage in sourcing (including, “material assistance”), licensing, or payments to a prohibited foreign entity. The material assistance restriction renders a taxpayer ineligible for the credit if a certain percentage of the value of a project is sourced from one or more prohibited foreign entities. A taxpayer needs to have a ratio higher than the thresholds set forth in the Act to qualify for the credit.

There are some exceptions, including for certain foreign-controlled publicly traded companies. There are also exceptions for certain manufactured products and eligible components acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and that are placed into service before January 1, 2030 (or for wind and solar facilities before January 1, 2028) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Key Takeaways

Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance. Ensuring that substantiation and documentation requirements are met at the outset will allow for better results during an IRS examination.

The Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba is choking on smoke as fires rage through the territories, with 767 people trying to escape the worst fires in history. The skies are filled with smoke here even, and the sun has been red in the sky for days. It’s really a terrifying feeling, that is hard to escape, it’s in our DNA to be fearful of catastrophe.

As the air particulates come to our land, and towns like Detroit Lakes and Grand Marais hit records for poor air quality, we go outside in masks or not at all .We are closer than we think. Some of our electricity comes from this very community, and the price is high. “Many that couldn’t get out because the junction at Highway 374 and Highway 373 is their lifeline to Norway House, and now it’s being compromised by the fire and the smoke,” said Chief David Monias, Chief of the Nation at Pimicikamak Okimawin – Cross Lake Band.

Terrifying. Pimicikamak is Cree territory of the north – Cross Lake it’s called. The word refers to a current cross the lake. It’s the same word as Bemidji – or Bemdjigaamag. The lake with a cross current. As I write, the airport is closed, roads and rivers compromised. Residents were being flown out from the bush airport, about 530 kilometers north of Winnipeg, but high winds and dry conditions worsened the situation, flights were cancelled without notice, just as Chief Monias issued a full evacuation order, telling the remaining 6,500 residents of the territory to head south to Norway House Cree Nation.

That’s another community is under an evacuation notice. While the media treats the raging fires as sort of an annual horror show, the background to these times has been building. Pimicikamak’s traditional territory is the upper Nelson River watershed, Kichi Sipi (Cree for Great River, or Mississippi). It drains the fourth largest watershed in North America. Lake Winnipeg, the seventh largest lake in North America, and two of the continent’s largest rivers.

There’s been a long assault on the integrity of that ecosystem, with Minnesotans as some of the primary beneficiaries. What am I talking about? Manitoba Hydro and the mega dams. Hydro electric power has been misrepresented as clean energy – but that’s a matter of scale. Drowning entire ecosystems under water, creating wastelands of dead trees, and receding shoreline, silting and clogging dams till they are inefficient.

Ecologically, the extensive boreal shoreline ecosystem nourishes the vast forests of the north and that destruction has a large ripple for the boreal forest. The boreal forest is an ecological stronghold remaining in North America. It is the northern lung of the planet, covering 40% of Canada’s land mass (and part of it is in Russia). It may be as important as the world’s rainforests (the other lung) in producing oxygen and absorbing greenhouse gases. But the boreal forest is now the most threatened of all major landscapes on our planet according to William Pruitt, at the University of Manitoba.

In Manitoba alone, hydro-electric development has resulted in the flooding or clearing of roughly 600,000 acres of boreal forest. That is roughly 10 times the area lost to clear-cutting in Canada annually. In addition, an unknown area of forest is lost each year as destabilized land is dumped into rivers and lakes by erosion. Canada is the world’s largest producer of hydroelectricity. The people who are dammed are Indigenous – a way of life buried under huge dams.

“Our people are grieving; they are grieving for land, the water and a way of life that was brought to an abrupt halt. I remember going along the shoreline to pick medicine with my late grandmother only to find it flooded. My grandmother stood there crying because that was her life. Her life was the land.”said Bobby Brightnose, traditional healer told a reporter.

“Millions of tons of earth wash into the rivers and lakes from shoreline erosion each year; erosion of burial sites continues to take place. Historic camp sites are washed away. Entire islands disappear. Spawning grounds have been destroyed. Wildlife has become scarce. Navigation has become hazardous. Our people feel and fear the effects day after day, week after week, year after year.” Nelson Miller, Pimicikamak Executive Council, said.

The response: “…it’s just the cost of doing business,” Manitoba Hydro President and CEO said, in regard to the 1994 death of a Pimicikamak citizen in a boating accident caused by Manitoba Hydro’s hydro-electric project. Who has benefited? That would be the US. The north has dams, and the powerlines go south. That’s what an energy colony looks like, and money is to be made. One of the largest contracts with Manitoba Hydro is with XCEL Energy. That, however, is about to change. Between Trump’s Trade War with Canada, and a visionary Premier of Manitoba – Wab Kinew, the first Anishinaabe Premier of Manitoba, the XCEL contracts will not be renewed.

On Aprii 14, Kinew announced that Manitoba Hydro would not renew two contracts totaling 500 megawatts of power capacity to XCEL. Instead, Manitoba has decided to export power to Nunavut, a largely Indigenous Province further north.

One more point. These fires are the direct result of fossil fuel combustion. Between Canada’s dirty tar sands, and Enbridge, there’s an ecological mess being made. Far away, those fires, but the smoke is in my lungs, scorches my throat and my primal fears are at an all-time high.

Pimicikamik, I pray for you.",https://thecirclenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hydro-damn.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:53.277558

Changes to the big, beautiful bill allow the automaker to plan on multi-million dollar tax breaks

The decision set criteria for Ford to show its Chinese affiliation was not an equal partnership

Ford Motor Co.’s massive electric vehicle battery factory under construction in Marshall will be eligible for federal tax credits after revisions to President Donald Trump’s so-called $3.4 trillion ""big, beautiful bill.”

The change follows a warning from the automaker’s executive chair Bill Ford Jr. in May, when he told Michigan business leaders gathered on Mackinac Island that the planned EV tax cuts in the bill “imperiled” the $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park.

Now Ford can move ahead with opening the facility as planned in 2026 with assurances that it could qualify for the Biden-era credits for manufacturers in effect when it launched construction in 2023 due to changes in how the US views the automaker’s relationship with a Chinese battery maker.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford spokesperson Jessica Enoch told Bridge in a statement on Tuesday.

Qualifying for the tax credit, she continued, is “a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

The factory is among Michigan’s largest manufacturing projects inked during the administration of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Originally valued at $3.5 billion, it promised 2,500 jobs in the community east of Battle Creek,

Facing concerns about EV profitability and battery capacity, Ford (NYSE:F) hit pause on the project after the state committed over $1.3 billion in public funding, including tax breaks and land development.

The automaker [NYSE:F] later reinstated its plans to build EV batteries with the less-expensive LFP technology, licensed from Chinese partner CATL.

Bill Ford: Federal EV policy changes ‘imperil’ $2B Michigan EV factory

Stung by EV losses, Ford plans smaller Michigan factory with fewer jobs

But this year, the Trump administration vowed to end federal subsidies for the EV market. The production credit — along with several other clean energy credits, including the $7,500 credit for buyers of many EVs — had been eliminated in the House and early Senate versions of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The move prompted Ford’s warnings, saying it was not fair to change the funding mid-stream, even as he said he agreed with the motives “to have a strong American industrial base.”

The sticking point became scrutiny by lawmakers of the CATL deal due to strained US-Chinese relations, prompting questions about Ford’s affiliation with the “foreign entity of concern.”

The Senate, after more than a month of lobbying by Ford, set the tax break criteria on “effective control” in the partnership, the Automotive News reported Tuesday.

The Dearborn automaker has said it is in control because it owns the site in Marshall and its equipment, the publication said, while CATL trains Ford workers.

Under the new revisions, the 45X Advance Manufacturing Production Credit will provide a credit of $35 per kWh for battery cells and $10 per kWh for modules. The bill says EV batteries must contain 60% U.S. content in 2026, increasing to 85% in 2030.

With the factory’s capacity reaching 20 gigawatt hours per year, the tax break could be worth tens of millions to Ford annually.

While Ford proceeds with its plans to open in Marshall in 2026, critics of CATL’s involvement are not comforted by the bill’s distinction of who’s in control.

""The nature of the ‘deal’ between Ford and China-based and Chinese Communist Party (CCP)- tied CATL remains high risk and volatile, both for our national security and taxpayers,” said Joseph Cella of Michigan, who served as US ambassador to Fiji.

The alliance remains “politically fraught,” Cella said. “I trust the Trump administration will continue to fortify the provision of our common defense from the threat presented by the CCP to our national and economic security.""

Marshall business leaders who were instrumental in the Ford deal are relieved by the final bill, they said. Many raised concerns about the end of the tax credit and emphasized over the last month that they are counting on this project’s economic boost.

“We are thrilled to hear that President Trump and Congress came together to preserve the pro-growth federal tax policies that ensure families and businesses across southwest Michigan and the state will continue to benefit from Ford’s investment in BlueOval Battery Park,” said James Durian, CEO of Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance.

“When Ford’s facility begins production next year, it will bring back our supply chain to the United States, which will make our country less reliant on – and more competitive with – foreign countries like China,” Durian said.

Even with the production tax credits surviving threatened cuts, Ford is still planning on EV battery production at a time when the market is volatile and rapidly changing.

Intense rain is falling more frequently in many areas of the U.S. — though where it occurs and whether it causes catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance, according to experts.
This week, flooding from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal prompted dozens of water rescues in other parts of North Carolina.
Nielsen-Gammon said the overall intensity of extreme rainfall in Texas has increased by 15% over the past 40-50 years.
Still, it’s almost impossible to predict where the most catastrophic rain will fall in any given year, Kunkel said.","It’s not just Texas and North Carolina. Intense rain is falling more frequently in many areas of the U.S. — though where it occurs and whether it causes catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance, according to experts.

More than 100 people died in Texas Hill Country over the weekend after 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in just hours. The deluge was driven by warm, moist air left over from Tropical Storm Barry and Hurricane Flossie that created conditions for repeated thunderstorms in the same location, said Texas Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon.

Last year, Hurricane Helene dumped more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain on western North Carolina, triggering catastrophic flooding that washed away roads and homes, killing more than 100 people in that state alone. This week, flooding from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal prompted dozens of water rescues in other parts of North Carolina. And this spring, record rainfall in Kentucky caused severe and deadly flooding.

Although it can be difficult to attribute a single weather event to climate change — and hilly or mountainous terrain worsen flooding — experts say a warming atmosphere and oceans due to the burning of fossil fuels make catastrophic storms more likely.

That’s because the atmosphere can hold 7% more water for every degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), creating a giant sponge of sorts that sucks up moisture from bodies of water and vegetation. The moisture later falls back to earth in increasingly intense, unpredictable and destructive downpours.

“It’s just loading the dice toward heavy rainfall when the situation is right,” said Kenneth Kunkel, a climate scientist at North Carolina State University.

Intensifying rain storms

Going back through U.S. weather station records dating to 1955, Kunkel found that rain over the past 20 years has become more intense in the eastern two-thirds of the country, including the southern Great Plains, where Texas is located. Intensities have remained the same or declined in the West and southwest.

At the 700 stations that began collecting data in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the highest proportion of two-day rainfall records have been set in just the past 10 years, Kunkel said, though that doesn’t fully reflect most Western stations, which were established later.

Nielsen-Gammon said the overall intensity of extreme rainfall in Texas has increased by 15% over the past 40-50 years.

Still, it’s almost impossible to predict where the most catastrophic rain will fall in any given year, Kunkel said.

“This month was the Texas Hill Country’s turn to get hit. Last fall ... in western North Carolina, it was our turn,” Kunkel said, adding that just because an area was spared over the past 20 or 30 years, it “doesn’t mean that they aren’t vulnerable. ... They got lucky.”

A ‘perfect storm’ in Texas

The worst flooding and greatest loss of life in Texas occurred in Kerr County, in an area known as “flash flood alley” because of its steep terrain that funnels water to the Guadalupe River, a popular recreational area.

Though the county did not get the most rain from the storms, the “distribution of rainfall was one of the worst possible patterns” because the most intense downpours were over the headwaters of the south fork of the Guadalupe River, causing water to rush into areas where hundreds of people, including children, were camping, said Nielsen-Gammon.

If the epicenter had been 10 miles (16 kilometers) north or south, the rain would have been divided among different river basins, he said. If it had been farther downstream, larger floodplains would have absorbed and slowed much of the water.

Years of drought also likely exacerbated the flooding.

Kerr County, for example, had been in extreme or exceptional drought for more than three years, aside from one four-week period last fall. That likely left the soil compacted, which caused water to run off instead of soaking into the ground, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist.

Then, air from the warmer-than-normal Gulf of Mexico — a reflection of global warming — blew into the state with a higher water content than it would have had decades ago.

It all added up to “just a perfect storm of events” that caused a catastrophe, said Rippey. “There are things that had to come together to make this happen.”

The existing tax credits Dominion expects to secure ​“will result in substantial savings for our customers,” he added.","On June 30, after an exhausting round of late-night negotiations, Delaware state legislators passed a bill to effectively green-light the Southeast’s second offshore wind farm. Within days, lawmakers in Washington passed legislation that may doom its future.

MarWin, the first phase of a 114-turbine project off the Delmarva Peninsula, is slated for installation in 2028 with onshore construction possibly starting next year, but that timeline is perhaps unrealistic, said Harrison Sholler, an offshore wind analyst with BloombergNEF. MarWin doesn’t have its financing in place yet to underwrite construction and, to make matters worse, Congress just unleashed a crushing new deadline.

When President Donald Trump signed the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” on Friday, he dramatically shortened the window in which offshore wind projects can qualify for tax credits that offset up to 30% of their costs. The law now requires new wind farms be ​“placed in service” by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify.

“We don’t predict any new offshore wind projects starting construction … at least in the next four years,” Sholler told Canary Media two days before Congress passed the bill.

He described Republicans’ tightening of the tax credit — from an original deadline to start construction by 2033 or potentially later, to this one-year sprint — as the final nail in the coffin for offshore wind farms that are fully approved but not currently underway. Two projects — MarWin near Maryland and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — float in this gray zone, and are now vulnerable to being put on ice indefinitely.

Wind developers have faced mounting hurdles in recent months: new tariffs, a federal permitting pause, higher investment risk, and the looming threat of the Trump administration halting already-approved projects, like it did in a shocking monthlong pause on New York’s Empire Wind.

A BloombergNEF report released in April states that losing the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, known as 45Y and 48E, would be ​“devastating” for U.S. projects already in the pipeline. Analysts estimate that the electricity produced by offshore wind farms that qualify for the credits costs on average 24% less over a project’s lifetime.

That April report predicted ​“all but the most advanced projects [will] pause development activities.” Now, with tax credits officially rolled back, prospects for offshore wind appear even more dim.

“If you take away the tax credits, it doesn’t make much sense to develop an entirely new sector,” said Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College who studies offshore wind policy.

America’s offshore wind sector is still in its infancy. While the U.K. has already built over 50 wind farms in its waters, America has only completed one large-scale project: South Fork Wind, located off the coast of Long Island, New York.

Trump issued an executive order on Inauguration Day that froze all offshore wind permitting and leasing pending a federal review. Seemingly safe from the president’s ire at the time were eight projects, including MarWin, that already had all their federal permits in hand. Since then, at least one of those permitted projects — the 2.8-gigawatt Atlantic Shores project off the New Jersey coast — has fallen apart. Five are currently under construction.

The largest offshore wind project now being built in America — Dominion Energy’s 2.6-gigawatt Virginia project — appears unscathed by the Inflation Reduction Act rollback.

“There is no impact to Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. The project is nearly 60 percent complete and is on schedule to be completed in late 2026,” wrote Jeremy Slayton, a spokesperson for Dominion Energy, in an email to Canary Media, dispelling concerns that the 176-turbine project off the Virginia coastline would suffer from the scaleback of tax credit eligibility.

The existing tax credits Dominion expects to secure ​“will result in substantial savings for our customers,” he added.

Dominion has so far spent approximately $6 billion on this monumental project. Some in the industry feared that the impact of Trump’s reconciliation bill could have been far worse, and are celebrating that the five wind farms under construction might see full operation.

“While this fight is over, I’m incredibly proud of Oceantic’s members and staff,” said Liz Burdock, president and CEO of the offshore wind industry group, in a July 3 statement after Congress passed the bill. ​“Because of their relentless push, developers now have one year to start construction and retain 100% of their tax credits, with a simple ​‘safe harbor’ option.” (On Monday, Trump issued an executive order that tries to further limit the bill’s ​“safe harbor” and ​“beginning of construction” options.)

But for Maryland and Delaware state lawmakers who backed MarWin in the face of considerable county-level pushback in recent months, the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” is a major blow. The project’s turbines were slated for installation off Maryland’s coastline but its cables would come ashore in Delaware, making it a much-anticipated joint investment.

On June 30, Delaware’s Democratic lawmakers passed a bill that strips Sussex County officials of their ability to revoke local permits for certain aspects of the wind project. A county-level block on an onshore substation was MarWin’s final hurdle and clearing it meant construction on the substation could, in theory, begin as early as February of next year.

“This bill helps eliminate unlawful and unnecessary hurdles to a project that will help ensure electric reliability for Delawareans while lowering the price they pay for electricity,” Nancy Sopko, a spokesperson for MarWin developer US Wind, told Canary Media via email.

But whether US Wind can lock in financing and officially break ground by July 2026 — the new deadline for tax credit eligibility — is another story. US Wind is suing the Sussex County Council over the permit denial in hopes of starting earlier, before the new state law goes into effect.

Before signing the final bill, Delaware’s Gov. Matt Meyer (D) said it is important to get the offshore wind energy project ​“done quickly and safely to provide sustainable power to Delaware.” Within days, however, MarWin had potentially been rendered incapable — at least in the view of analysts — of taking advantage of the tax credits that would make its construction financially possible.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1867528717_2025-07-08-210740_mecq.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4bc2872d35bc32080f5e67f93d54916a,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:59.551375

Under the tax and spending bill President Trump signed last week, those credits will no longer be available after September 30.

Federal incentives for EVs have a reasonably long history — they have been around in some form since 2008, back when EVs were just barely a thing.

“It was, for most car companies, a tech demonstration, a very low-volume production … mostly because of the high price of batteries,” said Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis.

At that point, car companies didn’t really know if these things would work — or if they’d sell. And they were really expensive to produce.

But with a tax credit, Tal said, “that allowed them to start thinking about it as a larger volume production.”

Soon, companies started investing in new plants, battery technology, and supply chains. A tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle allowed car companies to charge more for EVs and let the credit soften some of the sticker shock for consumers, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

“The incentive lowers the price for the end consumer, while the manufacturer still gets to keep an additional $7,000 above what the consumer is paying for the electric vehicles,” he said.

Last year, the Biden administration made the credits available at the point of sale. That helped electrics grow to just over 8% of vehicle sales in the U.S.

“This meant that you didn't have to worry about having that extra money to pay for the vehicle upfront. It meant that it expanded the market, for the average person to be able to buy the vehicles,” said Tallis Blalack, a consultant on EV infrastructure projects.

If you’re interested in going electric after the credits go away, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, said a lot of leased EVs that benefited from a credit will soon come off lease into the used vehicle market.

“There's going to be a lot more options for consumers at different price points, different segments,” she said.

That could be one legacy that outlives the EV tax credit.",https://img.apmcdn.org/0150e8facc1096c95eb78d6ad4d768d4ef54090d/widescreen/ae3c18-20250708-aerial-view-of-a-busy-highway-2000.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:16.807136

The facility would be Alaska’s first green ammonia plant.
Pacific H2 said the green ammonia facility could bring 150 jobs to Adak, where about 50 people live today.
While conventional ammonia production relies heavily on fossil fuels, green ammonia is produced entirely using renewable energy sources.
After those approvals, Pacific H2 would need to secure the $1.7 to $2.5 billion in funding.","The Aleut Corp., Adak’s regional Native corporation, signed an agreement in May to lease 3,500 acres to Pacific H2, an Oregon-based energy company. The 90-year lease allows Pacific H2 to build wind turbines that would power a permanently docked green ammonia plant in Adak’s harbor. The facility would be Alaska’s first green ammonia plant.

“This is a transformational opportunity for Aleut and for Adak,” said Skoey Vergen, CEO of the Aleut Corp. “It isn't just a clean energy project, it's an economic engine for Adak and the entire Aleut region.”

Vergen described the green ammonia facility as a potential “anchor point” for revitalizing Adak, an island that formerly housed a large military base.

The project would be Pacific H2’s first facility and could cost nearly $2 billion to complete. The company plans to start a yearlong wind study this summer for the 70 wind turbines proposed for the project.

Pacific H2 said the green ammonia facility could bring 150 jobs to Adak, where about 50 people live today. The island has a lot of abandoned infrastructure from a naval air station that closed in 1997, and residents have been looking into ways to revitalize their community.

Adak City Manager Breck Craig said the community is mostly excited about the facility’s potential benefits, like high-paying jobs and access to renewable energy.

“It's a real game changer, as long as they can address the environmental concerns around ammonia,” Craig said.

So what exactly is green ammonia? It’s not the color that makes it “green” – it’s how the ammonia is produced. While conventional ammonia production relies heavily on fossil fuels, green ammonia is produced entirely using renewable energy sources.

Pacific H2 would use Adak’s wind and water to power and produce the facility. The company expects the plant will make more than 2,000 tons of ammonia annually.

Ammonia can be toxic in high concentrations, a particular concern given that part of Adak lies within the federally protected Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.

Pacific H2’s CEO Charles Deister said the facility would follow established safety protocols used in industrial ammonia plants for decades, including double-walled pipes and multiple containment systems.

“We’ll have gas detection systems, emergency ventilation systems, there'll be various alarms, automatic shutdown valves,” Deister said in a community presentation in June.

The company also plans to establish a “buffer zone” prohibiting vessel traffic around the facility.

So why invest in green ammonia? According to Deister, green ammonia is in high demand in Asia, making Adak’s location ideal for shipping.

“Adak is as far west as we can get. It reduces the shipping time to the lowest possible,” he said. “For example, Adak to Tokyo is a seven-day shipping time at 14 knots.”

The project still needs permits and environmental reviews, which could take several years. After those approvals, Pacific H2 would need to secure the $1.7 to $2.5 billion in funding. If all goes according to plan, the facility could begin producing green ammonia by 2032.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/260fc76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3037x1594+0+57/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F18%2Fe2%2F3850207c42f8856fec7664256629%2Fimg-9652.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:05:04.078096

Introducing new tax deductions for businesses and rollbacks of clean energy measures, the bill, which was signed into law on July 4, saw criticism from labor unions concerned about workers and apprentices on renewable energy jobs. Some contractors and engineering firms applauded the bill for job creation and growth through extended tax reform.

The 900-page legislation included a wide range of tax breaks, spending cuts, money for national defense and deportation, the Associated Press reported. The new law affects nearly every American citizen, with money for the border wall and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP funding.

The legislation has around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, which lawmakers said was crucial as tax breaks from Trump’s first term were set to expire in December, the AP reported. It will solidify the tax cuts approved in the president’s first term.

The SALT cap, which is a deduction limit on payment for state and local taxes, will quadruple from $10,000 to $40,000 through 2029, as reported by the AP.

Clean energy tax credits axed under ‘big beautiful’ bill

A big provision in the bill is cutting tax credits that were designed to boost clean energy projects that used renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. In 2022, former president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which focused on addressing climate change by incentivizing the use of renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Different legs of the construction industry have watched the IRA closely as the bill included prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship participation for clean energy credits. Around $2.7 billion in tax credits were included in the IRA for clean manufacturing and recycling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Tax breaks for solar and wind were crucial for labor unions such as the Laborers’ International Union of North America. After the Senate passed the bill, Kent Miller, president and business manager of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, said on social media the Senate’s version of the bill was a “jobs killer for the wind and solar industry.”

The bill included a provision that would get rid of tax credits for projects if they aren’t completed by 2027, Miller added.

“That means some projects that were counting on those credits may not move forward and that means less job opportunities for our members,” Miller said. “You might say, “Hey, I don’t work in solar, so this doesn’t affect me.” But as trade unionists we believe an injury to one is an injury to all. And health and pension funds live and die on growing members and growing more work hours,” he added.

Miller addressed the fact that the legislation included a temporary tax deduction on overtime.

“Not taxing your overtime doesn’t mean [expletive] if you don’t have a job,” he said.

Seven Wisconsin labor leaders representing trades such as painters, sheet metal workers, plumbers, concrete masons and electricians on July 2 took part in a virtual press event to speak out against the “big beautiful” bill and its rollbacks for federal incentives.

The BlueGreen Alliance, a nonprofit bridging labor unions and environmentalist groups that hosted the event, shared that the bill will risk $8.6 billion in private investments and put more than 7,000 jobs at risk in Wisconsin.

Andy Buck, the director of governmental affairs for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 7, said clean energy projects put union members to work and gave apprentices a start in the trades. Because of high apprenticeship participation standards, IUPAT saw a record number of apprentices last year, he added.

However, repealing the energy tax credit will mean communities already planning projects using that credit will have to rethink their plans, Buck said.

Engineering companies applaud the legislation

Before the bill made it to Trump’s desk, the American Council of Engineering Companies leadership on July 3 praised chambers of Congress for passing the spending bill and for its extension of tax laws established under the previous administration.

“ACEC applauds the passage of this critical legislation that will promote job creation and innovation across the U.S. Economy,” said Linda Bauer Darr, president and CEO of ACEC, in a statement. “The extension of the 2017 Tax Law will deliver critical certainty for American businesses. These are pro-growth policies that directly support investment, innovation, and workforce expansion, especially in the engineering sector,” she added.

Eighty-two percent of engineering companies used their tax savings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to hire new employees, data from the ACEC Research Institute showed. Tax savings were also used to invest in technology and expand services, officials added.

Among scores of business-related tax cuts, the legislation will allow businesses to write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.

“In addition, this bill includes a long-sought provision by ACEC to permanently restore full deductibility of R&D expenses for engineering firms,” Darr said. “Engineering firms are in the innovation business, designing the next generation of American infrastructure, and it was critical to restore the tax code’s traditional role in incentivizing research and development.

“As the bill heads to the president’s desk, we commend both chambers of Congress for delivering a package that gives America’s engineering industry the certainty it needs to improve our communities while developing the next generation of engineers. While more work remains, particularly around energy tax policy, this legislation is a strong step forward for America’s future,” Darr added.

The Associated Builders and Contractors also applauded the bill’s signing.

“On this July 4, ABC celebrates Congress and the White House working together to bring this pro-growth tax reform to reality for the millions of hardworking Americans who build and power our economy,” said Kristen Swearingen, ABC vice president of government affairs, in a statement. “This new law provides long-overdue tax certainty that empowers construction businesses to invest in their workforce, expand operations and keep America building,” she added.

The legislation provided certainty to more than 95% of American businesses structured as S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships, ABC officials said. Those businesses employ 62% of the private sector workforce, officials added.

Highlighted reforms included solidifying deductions for small businesses, a permanent increase to the estate tax exclusion amount, restoration of full bonus depreciation and expanding the use of 529 savings accounts for career and technical education in the skilled trades.

“Now that this critical legislation has been signed, we urge Congress and the administration to build on this momentum by enacting additional reforms to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses,” Swearingen said. “Smart, targeted regulatory relief will give contractors even greater ability to create jobs, strengthen their communities and drive economic growth nationwide,” she added.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/07/Depositphotos_478070700_XL.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:15:21.918636

Dirty coal plants that continue to operate despite economic inefficiencies are sometimes called ""zombie"" plants.
""More clean energy will make the U.S. grid stronger, more reliable, and more resilient.""
""The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump administration is forcing on the country's ratepayers.""
In 2017, the first Trump administration also moved to bail out financially floundering coal and nuclear plants.","Green groups warned Tuesday that the Trump administration's plan to invoke a bogus ""energy emergency"" in order to keep old, polluting coal-fired plants running will make electricity generation dirtier and more expensive while failing to produce enough power to keep up with surging demand.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy published a resource adequacy analysis that includes plans for boosting fossil-fueled electricity generation, including at coal-fired plants. The report cites President Donald Trump's executive orders declaring a national energy emergency and strengthening the reliability and security of the nation's electric grid, and highlights the DOE's plan to classify aging fossil fuel plants as critical to system reliability. The administration is also likely to continue invoking Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and the Defense Production Act in order to extend the lifespans of older fossil fuel plants.

Although the analysis acknowledges that ""old tools won't solve new problems,"" its methodology supports keeping expensive and polluting coal plants in operation. Dirty coal plants that continue to operate despite economic inefficiencies are sometimes called ""zombie"" plants.

""More clean energy will make the U.S. grid stronger, more reliable, and more resilient.""

Not only does the report fail to state that the burning of fossil fuels is the leading driver of the climate emergency, it does not even mention the word ""climate"" once in its 73 pages. This tracks with the Trump administration's long-standing proscription of the term ""climate change.""

""The methodology released today is another attempt to push the false narrative that our country's energy future depends upon decades-old coal and gas plants, rather than clean renewables,"" said Sierra Club senior attorney Greg Wannier. ""The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump administration is forcing on the country's ratepayers.""

Wannier noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and states ""are already well equipped to meet any projected resource needs through the existing regulatory process, which ensures that electricity demand is reliably met at the least public cost.""

""Any effort by DOE to override this process to forcibly keep coal plants online past their planned retirements would be an extraordinary and unlawful overreach of its regulatory authority,"" Wannier added. ""It would be particularly harmful and costly to the communities living near these power plants who face the possibility of continued exposure to toxic levels of air and water pollution.""

Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, said Tuesday:

The Trump administration is once again putting its thumb on the scale to help old, dirty power sources at the expense of air quality, public health, and higher energy bills for American families and businesses. This time it has issued a methodology that uses dodgy accounting to ignore all the clean energy we have at our disposal—including solar, wind, and battery technologies that are helping meet our nation's energy needs and support the reliability of our electric grid—in order to make a bogus case that these old, dirty power plants are needed. The administration's deeply flawed approach can't hide the fact that clean energy resources are helping keep lights on and lower electricity bills across the country, while keeping old, dirty power plants on life support will mean higher power bills for families and more toxic, cancer-causing pollution in the air we breathe.

The Trump administration has already used the nonexistent energy emergency in a push to fast-track fossil fuel permitting, keep fossil-fueled plants operating, and to wage lawfare against Democrat-controlled states trying to hold Big Oil financially accountable for its role in causing the climate emergency. In 2017, the first Trump administration also moved to bail out financially floundering coal and nuclear plants.

""No matter how they try to gussy it up, bailing out coal or other fossil fuels when low-cost solar and wind power is growing so quickly makes even less sense today than it did in 2017 when the previous Trump administration tried it before,"" Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said in response to the DOE plan.

""It's ironic that the Energy Department is warning about reliability just days after Republicans in Congress repealed the clean energy tax credits,"" Kennedy added, referring to a provision in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by Trump on Friday.

NRDC cites analysts' predictions that the legislation will reduce additions of the electricity needed to meet rapidly growing demand and raise wholesale electricity prices as much as 25% by 2030 and up to 74% by 2035.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61180292&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C76%2C0%2C77,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:21.141686

Despite this, analysts expect the EV market to grow.
VinFast's sales in the United States are very limited, comprising only 6.2% of total revenues in 2024.
However, the company must deal with 25% automotive tariffs, which hurt its competitiveness in the United States.
While VinFast Auto currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","Understanding the electric vehicle market has become increasingly important over the past several years as EV sales have really started to explode.

Looking forward, EVs are likely to become a larger part of the overall economy, presenting a significant opportunity for investors. The International Energy Agency reported that in 2024, 20% of new cars sold were electric vehicles. They expect this number to grow to 40% by 2030, positioning EVs as a clear growth market. However, the path to this is not likely to be a straight one, especially as government attitudes toward EVs shift.

Take the passing of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” for example. It means that the significant tax breaks that come from buying EVs in the United States will expire in September, which will weigh on adoption. Despite this, analysts expect the EV market to grow.

VinFast Auto NASDAQ: VFS and Lucid Group NASDAQ: LCID stand out as two electric vehicle stocks with high upside potential, positioned to benefit from shifting market dynamics and evolving U.S. policies.

Big Beautiful Bill Increases VinFast’s Chances of U.S. Success

VinFast makes and sells relatively low-cost EVs primarily in Vietnam. The MarketBeat consensus price target on the company is $5.75, implying that shares could rise by nearly 64%.

Ending the EV tax credit actually helps VinFast. Its vehicles were not eligible to receive it before, putting it at a disadvantage in the U.S. market. Now, the playing field will become more level as domestic companies will no longer receive the credit either.

VinFast's sales in the United States are very limited, comprising only 6.2% of total revenues in 2024. Thus, the United States represents a significant growth opportunity for VinFast that just became easier to capitalize on. However, the company must deal with 25% automotive tariffs, which hurt its competitiveness in the United States.

Still, Vinfast clearly doesn’t need the United States to grow fast. EV deliveries spiked 296% last quarter, while E-scooter deliveries rose 473%. The company is still deeply unprofitable, with a gross margin of negative 35%. However, this figure is a big improvement over its negative 59% gross margin a year ago. VinFast will need to continue making progress here by accelerating production and deliveries to achieve greater economies of scale. The recent opening of the company’s second factory should aid this. The company also just signed with its first authorized dealership in California as it looks to expand its U.S. presence.

Recent Price Targets Indicate +40% Upside in Lucid

The MarketBeat consensus price target on Lucid is $2.68, implying a solid but not huge 27% upside in shares. However, focusing on the stock’s two most recent price target updates paints a considerably more bullish picture. Both come in at $3, which implies 42% upside in shares.

In contrast to VinFast, most of the company’s revenue comes from the United States, accounting for around 73% of its total sales in 2024. The rest of the company’s sales primarily come from Saudi Arabia. The company will no longer be able to benefit from tax credits post-September, but some believe that this will actually help Lucid.

That includes James Picariello of BNP Paribas. He believes that the sunsetting of the credit means that Lucid will face less EV competition. This is because companies that make both EVs and gas-powered vehicles may “deemphasize” their EV ambitions in the United States as government incentives go away. This is plausible, but it is also important to note that companies like Ford Motor NYSE: F have invested billions in their EV efforts. Given the long-term growth many see in this market, they are not likely to simply hand over this growth to EV pure plays.

In Q2, Lucid’s vehicle deliveries hit 3,309, rising by 38% compared to the same period a year ago. Like many early-stage EV makers, Lucid remains highly unprofitable. It will need to significantly boost deliveries to change this.

Winning in the United States Is Key to VinFast and Lucid’s Success

VinFast and Lucid are attempting to compete in the crowded U.S. vehicle market. Success will be key to achieving the scale required to be profitable one day. With EV tax credits set to expire soon, shifts in the competitive landscape may help their ambitions, which could help shares achieve the significant upside some analysts see.

“While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim,” reports Tech Crunch.

A potent combination of tariffs, anti-clean energy legislation, and stunningly bad PR have led to devastating drops in the company’s share values, with reverberating consequences for the company’s many ventures, not to mention clean energy tech research and development writ large.

Tesla has been failing to meet its forecasts for a while now, even with projections much reduced to reflect the current policy atmosphere. For two consecutive financial quarters, the company’s vehicle deliveries have fallen short of 400,000. Bloomberg reports that “Tesla Inc. is in trouble,” adding that “having promised a revolutionary new automated product for a decade, missing repeated deadlines, the company finally launched a limited, somewhat automated pilot that looks years behind the competition.”

While the company’s electric vehicle sales numbers have been dismal since the middle of last year, the company has had at least one bright spot of growth in its portfolio – its energy storage business. Between 2020 and 2024, revenue derived from energy storage and solar installations ballooned from $2 billion to $10.1 billion. But even this business is not immune to the pall cast over the company. Deployments of its Powerwall and Megapack stationary storage products have declined in the first two quarters of this year.

On Monday, Tesla’s stock tumbled 7.5% in a single morning as the (in)famous founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced that he will be forming his own political party. This move comes on the heels of a frenzied period of collaboration followed by a high-profile fracas with President Donald Trump. Investors are clearly worried about Musk’s behavior, and the stock market is reflecting that defection.

“Very simply, Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, recently told The Guardian. He added that there is a “broader sense of exhaustion” among Tesla investors stemming from Musk’s repeated and divisive involvement in the political sphere.

Ironically, Musk’s company has been kneecapped by the very same political party and policy initiatives that Musk himself helped spearhead in the initial months of the Trump presidency. While Musk stood with his arms folded in the Oval Office, his company was releasing statements against Trump’s proposed end to clean energy tax credits, writing on X (also owned by Musk) that “abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

The current administration’s approach to clean energy subsidies and international trade amount to a whole lot of bad news for nearly all of Tesla’s portfolio, including energy storage. “While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim,” reports Tech Crunch. Like so many other domestic clean energy supply chains, the lion’s share of raw materials are sourced from China, which dominates global critical mineral refining.

Musk is now publicly distancing himself from Trump, but the damage is already done. The bottom is about to fall out of electric vehicle sales thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, a (highly predictable) outcome which Musk realized “too late.”

The impact of the bill on domestic clean energy, energy storage, and other major growth sectors in global energy markets are likely to hit American consumers hard, potentially “setting America up for the worst energy-affordability crisis since the 1970s.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk is still the richest person on planet earth, by a comfortable margin.

We discussed the version of the bill that passed in the House in May (the House bill) in our previous update. On July 1, the Senate passed the OBBBA, which was then passed in the House on July 3 and signed into law by the president on July 4.

The OBBBA includes significant changes to the timing and availability of several clean energy tax credits, including the clean energy ITC (CEITC) and PTC (CEPTC), the clean hydrogen PTC, the advanced manufacturing credit, and the zero-emission nuclear PTC, as well as restrictions related to foreign entities applicable to such credits and to the carbon capture sequestration credit. The OBBBA includes various timeframes for grandfathering renewable energy projects from such changes.

A chart of key dates for solar, wind, and battery projects under the OBBBA can be downloaded here.

Key Changes

This alert focuses on issues of particular significance to the energy industry and the timeframes for beginning construction before the relevant effective dates and is not intended to be comprehensive. Four key changes discussed below include:

Accelerated phase-out of various clean energy tax credits;

New restrictions related to foreign entities of concern (FEOC);

Adoption of existing beginning of construction guidance for purposes of the FEOC restrictions; and

Denial of CEITC and CEPTC for small wind leasing arrangements.

Accelerated Phase-Out/Sunset of CEPTC, CEITC, Clean Hydrogen PTC, and Advanced Manufacturing Credits

Sections 45Y (the CEPTC) and 48E (the CEITC)

For solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after enactment), the OBBBA phases out the CEPTC and CEITC for projects placed in service after 2027.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the phase-out period for the CEPTC and the CEITC for all projects (including solar and wind) would have occurred over three calendar years, commencing upon the later of 2032 and the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production have been reduced by 75% from 2022 levels.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The one-year ""beginning of construction"" standard is much more accommodating than both the 60-day standard in the House bill and the ""date of enactment"" standard in an early draft of the OBBBA in the Senate. The early draft of the OBBBA in the Senate also included an excise tax that applied to solar and wind projects based on use of foreign materials, which is no longer included in the OBBBA. We note that the 2027 placed in service deadline is unlikely to apply to many utility-scale solar and wind projects given typical project development timelines.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The final OBBBA does not include the elimination of five-year MACRS for CEITC and CEPTC property that was included in early drafts of the Senate bill.

Section 45V (Clean Hydrogen PTC)

The OBBBA accelerates the phase-out for the clean hydrogen PTC by revising the beginning of construction deadline to January 1, 2028.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the beginning of construction deadline for the clean hydrogen PTC was January 1, 2033.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: It may be more challenging for clean hydrogen projects to meet the beginning of construction deadline than wind or solar projects, given that the industry is still nascent and many developers are not yet able to procure significant equipment. However, the December 31, 2027, deadline is much more accommodating than the House bill, which included a December 31, 2025, deadline.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Credits)

The Section 45X advanced manufacturing credit applies different credit rates to the production of different eligible components.

For tax years beginning after enactment, the OBBBA modifies the relevant phase-out and termination dates for certain types of eligible components and the requirements for battery modules.

Metallurgical coal was added as an applicable critical mineral, but the advanced manufacturing credit rate is only 2.5% (as opposed to the 10% rate for other applicable critical minerals).

For applicable critical minerals (except for metallurgical coal), the OBBBA adds a phase-out that begins in 2031 (prior law included no phase-out or termination for critical minerals). The OBBBA terminates the credit for wind energy components and metallurgical coal. For wind energy components, the advanced manufacturing credit is terminated for components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. For metallurgical coal, the advanced manufacturing credit is terminated for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the phase-out period for the advanced manufacturing credit was set to begin in 2030 for eligible components other than critical minerals, with the complete phase-out for components sold after 2032.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The accelerated phase-out for wind components is consistent with the Administration's other policies, including a presidential memorandum targeting wind energy and an order to stop work on the Empire Wind 1 Project.

Finally, the term ""battery module"" was modified to clarify that battery modules are comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Restrictions on Foreign Entities and Investors

The OBBBA includes complex restrictions related to relationships with or assistance from certain FEOCs, which apply to the CEITC, CEPTC, the Section 45Q carbon capture sequestration credit, the Section 45U nuclear PTC, and the advanced manufacturing credit.

For taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, no such credit is available if the facility is owned by a ""specified foreign entity"" (SFE). An SFE is defined in the OBBBA to include specifically identified threats to the security of the U.S., Chinese military companies operating in the U.S., entities subject to Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act restrictions, and battery-producing entities eligible for Department of Defense contracts as identified by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: This definition includes Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL), BYD Company, Envision Energy, EVE Energy Company, Gotion High Tech Company, and Hithium Energy Storage Company, thus impacting significantly all battery energy storage systems.

SFEs also include foreign-controlled entities. An entity will generally be a ""foreign-controlled entity"" only if it is owned more than 50% by entities or individuals with ties to North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran.

In addition, for taxable years beginning after two years after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, no credit is allowed under Section 45U if the facility is owned by a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (FIE). Further, no credit is allowed under Section 45Q, Section 45X, Section 45Y, and Section 48E for any taxable year beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA if the facility is owned by an FIE. An FIE is one that satisfies one of two tests: first, one of the following conditions must be met during the applicable taxable year: (i) an SFE has authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate 40% or more of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more SFEs. Second, during the previous taxable year, the entity must have made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement which entitles such SFE (or an entity related to such SFE) to exercise control over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer) or (ii) with respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (a) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (b) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

Effectively controlled entities are ineligible for credits. For purposes of defining an FIE, the OBBBA broadens the definition of effective control to encompass licensing agreements and related contractual arrangements with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible facility where (i) a contractual counterparty retains any of the following rights to: (A) control sourcing of components and subcomponents, (B) direct operations, (C) restrict the taxpayer's use of intellectual property, (D) receive royalties beyond 10 years of a licensing or similar agreement, (E) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into service agreements exceeding two years, (ii) such agreement fails to provide the licensee with the technical data and know-how necessary to produce an eligible component independently, without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or an SFE, or (iii) such agreement was entered into after the date of enactment. However, the OBBBA carves out the bona fide purchase and sale of intellectual property from the restrictions, excluding purchases where the intellectual property reverts after a period of time.

The OBBBA provides that the Secretary shall issue such guidance with respect to the FIE provisions no later than December 31, 2026.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: If read literally, the practical effect of the ""entered into after the date of enactment"" standard is that any licensing agreements executed after July 4, 2025 are deemed to provide the licensee with effective control.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The OBBBA's omission of the FEOC rules from Section 48 means that geothermal heat pump property that begins construction before January 1, 2035, will not be subject to the FEOC rules if the Section 48 ITC is claimed with respect to such property.

In addition to the ownership-related restrictions described above, new project-level restrictions prevent facilities from being eligible for the CEITC, CEPTC, or advanced manufacturing credits if they begin construction after the end of 2025 (or, in the case of the advanced manufacturing credits in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, if an eligible component is used in a product sold before January 1, 2027) and receive ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" (PFE). A PFE is an SFE or an FIE. The term ""material assistance"" from a PFE means that, with respect to any property, a facility has a ""material assistance cost ratio"" that is less than the applicable threshold percentage.

With respect to any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the threshold percentage is 40% in the case of a qualified facility that begins construction in 2026 and is 55% in the case of energy storage technology that begins construction in 2026. The threshold percentage increases 5% each year through 2029. The ""material assistance cost ratio"" for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to (i) the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology other than the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products (including components) that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, divided by (ii) the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) that are incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology.

The OBBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables to identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or eligible component that is attributable to a PFE and to provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer's material assistance from a PFE no later than December 31, 2026. Prior to the issuance of such safe harbor tables, taxpayers may use the tables included in Notice 2025-08 to establish the percentage of the total direct material costs of any listed eligible component and any manufactured product, and rely on a certification by the supplier of the manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent of an eligible component regarding (i) the total direct costs or the total direct material costs, as applicable, of such product or component that was not produced or manufactured by a PFE, or (ii) that such product or component was not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: While compliance with the material assistance ratio may not be as burdensome for taxpayers developing projects with domestic content strategies, the compliance burden may be more significant for projects without such strategies in place.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: Certain suppliers may be reluctant to provide certifications since violations of the material assistance ratio resulting from misrepresentations can result a penalty to the person that provides the certification.

Taxpayers may elect to exclude costs from the material assistance cost ratio with respect to a product, component, element, material, or subcomponent that is (i) acquired, manufactured, or assembled pursuant to a binding written contract with a PFE that was entered into before June 16, 2025, and (ii) placed in service before 2030 (or before 2028, in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The material assistance ratio is expected to impact nearly all major suppliers of battery storage systems and solar modules.

The OBBBA amends the recapture rules for the CEITC to provide that payments to FEOCs result in recapture of the CEITC. However, unlike the normal ITC recapture rules, this FEOC recapture rule applies during the 10-year period beginning at placed in service, and results in 100% recapture at all points during that period.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The recapture rule for the CEITC is stricter than the FIE disallowance discussed above as applied to the CEPTC because an applicable payment to an SFE results in the recapture of the entire CEITC. With respect to the CEPTC, such a payment results in the disallowance of the CEPTC for the taxable year following the payment.

Adoption of Existing Beginning of Construction Guidance for Purposes of the FEOC Restrictions

For purposes of the FEOC restrictions, the OBBBA provides that the beginning of construction date is determined pursuant to rules similar to Notice 2013-29 and Notice 2018-59 as well as any subsequently issued guidance in effect on January 1, 2025.

Additionally, the OBBBA directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations and guidance to prevent the circumvention of the FEOC restrictions. Further, on July 7, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Treasury to issue new guidance to ensure that policies concerning the ""beginning of construction"" are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: Taxpayers may find it helpful that the OBBBA adopts a familiar standard for the beginning of construction given the longstanding application of the beginning of construction guidance. However, the anti-circumvention rule and executive order indicate the IRS may change the standard to take a more prohibitive approach.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: For existing ""beginning of construction"" guidance, please see our prior analysis on Notices 2013-29, 2013-60, 2014-46, 2015-25, 2016-31, 2017-04, 2018-59, 2019-43, 2020-41, and 2021-41.

Denial of Credit for Expenditures for Small Wind Leasing Arrangements

The OBBBA denies the CEITC or CEPTC to solar water heating and wind generation property if the taxpayer rents such property to a third party. Unlike the House bill, solar electric property is not included in the list of prohibited property. Accordingly, residential solar electric property that is leased to customers remains eligible for the CEITC and CEPTC.

Conclusion

As enacted, the OBBBA provides substantive rules and transition rules that are significantly more favorable to the industry than interim versions of the bill that had been proposed. Because certain of the more unfavorable provisions in the OBBBA do not apply to projects that ""begin construction"" as of certain dates, it is essential to consider and implement ""beginning of construction"" strategies for applicable projects as soon as possible.

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.","President Trump signed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (the “OBBB”) into law on July 4, 2025. Congress passed the legislation using the budget reconciliation process to avoid the 60-vote Senate filibuster. In addition to making many of the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, the bill makes significant changes to many of the clean energy credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Projects that began construction before 2025 and are planning on claiming production tax credits (“PTCs”) or investment tax credits (“ITCs”) under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. However, the OBBB is a mixed bag when it comes to the other energy tax credits that were introduced or extended by the IRA. The OBBB makes substantial cuts to the tech-neutral tax credits for solar and wind and eliminates certain other energy tax credits (e.g., those for hydrogen, EVs and homeowners), but other technologies and activities (e.g., geothermal, carbon capture, nuclear, clean fuel production) experienced fewer claw backs of the benefits provided by the IRA. The OBBB also adds foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions to the surviving energy tax credits. Finally, the OBBB expands the definition of “qualifying income” (“QI”) for master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) under section 7704(d)(1)(E).

While a prior version of the OBBB released by the Senate contained an excise tax on certain wind and solar facilities deemed to have received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (“PFE”), the tax was removed shortly before its passage by the Senate and is not included in the OBBB.

On July 7, 2025, President Trump also issued an Executive Order (Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources) (the “EO”) directing the Secretary of the Treasury to, within 45 days of enactment of the OBBB, “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” The EO specifically directs Treasury to issue new and revised guidance on “beginning of construction” (BOC), and notes that broad safe harbors should not apply “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” In the same 45-day window, Treasury is also directed to implement the FEOC restrictions in the OBBB.

Below is a summary of the key changes for the clean energy industry as a result of the enactment of the OBBB.

I. TAX CREDIT AND DEDUCTION MODIFICATIONS

1. Sections 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credits when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

PIS DEADLINE: Adds a placed in service (PIS) deadline for solar and wind facilities of December 31, 2027.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (e., more than 12 months after the enactment of OBBB).

Akin Note: Allowing construction to begin for up to one year after enactment was a late change to OBBB. However, taxpayers’ ability to take advantage of this window may be limited as a result of guidance to be issued by Treasury implementing the EO.]

Statute makes clear that batteries are not impacted by this change. Other facilities that qualify for credits under §§ 45Y and 48E (besides solar and wind facilities) are also not impacted.

[Akin Note: The language making clear that batteries are not impacted by this change is arguably not necessary in light of the Treasury position in regulations that energy storage technologies cannot be part of qualified facilities.]

LEASING DISALLOWANCE: Disallows credits for solar electric heating and small wind residential property if the taxpayer rents or leases the property.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., after enactment of the OBBB).

[Akin Note: In earlier versions of OBBB, this rule also applied to residential photovoltaic solar systems. The final enacted version of OBBB does not disallow ITCs or PTCs for residential photovoltaic solar systems.]

PHASEOUT TIMELINE: Sets both §§ 45Y and 48E to begin phasing out in 2032.

Except for solar and wind facilities that have a special PIS deadline (see above), facilities that qualify for either §§ 45Y or 48E and:

BOC before 2034 can access the full credit;

BOC in 2034 can access 75% of the credit;

BOC 2035 can access 50% of the credit; and

BOC after 2035 cannot access either credit.

TAX OWNERSHIP OF GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS: For purposes of determining tax ownership geothermal heat pumps for depreciation and tax credit purposes, the fact that such property is not readily usable by anyone other than the lessee or offtaker is disregarded.

[Akin Note: This point removes a key obstacle to allowing geothermal heat pumps to be subject to “third party ownership” structures which more readily allows for tax equity financing.]

FUEL CELL FACILITIES (§ 48E (ITC) only): Removes requirement that the anticipated greenhouse gas emission rate not be greater than zero for fuel cell facilities.

Changes apply to facilities the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025.

Sets a 30% ITC rate without the ability to increase with adders and apparently without needing to satisfy Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship requirements.

NUCLEAR ENERGY COMMUNITY (§ 45Y (PTC) only): Creates an energy community adder based on local employment in nuclear facilities, nuclear R&D, and nuclear component manufacturing.

DOMESTIC CONTENT (§ 48E (ITC) only): Facilities that begin construction on and after June 16, 2025, are subject to the same domestic content thresholds for the ITC as the PTC.

Domestic content thresholds are 45% for BOC in 2025, 50% for BOC in 2026 and 55% for BOC in 2027+ (separate rates still apply for off-shore wind).

[Akin Note: This change corrects what has long been viewed as a typo or glitch in the statutory framework.]

Facilities that began construction before June 16, 2024, can utilize a 40% threshold.

2. Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT EXTENSION: Extends the deadline to sell eligible fuel from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2029.

EMISSIONS RATES: Disallows emissions rates from being negative, excludes indirect land use changes from the lifecycle analysis, and requires Treasury to provide emissions rates for each specific animal manure feedstock.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

[Akin Note: Many clean fuels producers were hoping to be able to generate multiples of the statutory credit rate as a result of their fuel having negative emissions rates. This change eliminates this possibility, which had previously been implied by other statutory language that contemplated negative emissions rates.]

FEEDSTOCK SOURCING: Requires feedstock to be produced or grown exclusively in the United Stated, Mexico or Canada.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

Disallows any feedstock sources that already generated a 45Z credit but includes a directive to Treasury to issue regulations or guidance to implement this anti-double counting rule.

RELATED PARTY SALES: Directs Treasury to expand the rule allowing sales between related parties prior to a sale to an unrelated party.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL: Eliminates the increased credit rate of $1.75/gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but the standard $1.00/gallon rate remains available for SAF.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.

Applies to fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB), and to fuel sold or used before such date if claims for the § 6426(k) excise tax credit have not been paid or allowed as of such date.

3. Section 45Q (Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT RATES: Equalizes the credit rate for all potential disposal pathways (g., EOR, secure geologic storage and utilization) to $17/MT (indexed for inflation after 2026).

Rate is $36/MT for direct air capture.

Applies to facilities PIS after July 4, 2025 (e., after the date of the enactment of OBBB).

4. Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

SALE OF INTEGRATED COMPONENTS: No credit for the sale of integrated components unless certain requirements are satisfied.

Applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

To the extent an eligible component (called a “primary component”) is incorporated into another eligible component (called a “secondary component”) prior to sale to an unrelated person, a 45X credit is allowed with respect to the primary component only if:

The secondary component is produced in the same manufacturing facility as the primary component; and

At least 65% of the total direct material costs of the secondary component are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States.

PHASEOUT FOR WIND ENERGY COMPONENTS: Wind energy components, sold after December 31, 2027, no longer generate a 45X credit.

PHASEOUT FOR CRITICAL MINERALS: Adds a phaseout for applicable critical minerals produced after 2030 based on timing of production.

ADDITION OF METALLURGICAL COAL: Metallurgical coal added as an applicable critical mineral.

Defined as “metallurgical coal which is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the notice published by the Department of Energy entitled ‘Critical Material list; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking’ (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))), regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.”

Generates credit at a special rate of 2.5% of costs (as opposed to 10% for other critical minerals).

Applies only to metallurgical coal produced before December 31, 2029.

REVISED DEFINITION OF BATTERY MODULE: Definition of “battery module” is updated to include a requirement for the module to include “all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.”

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., taxable years beginning after the enactment of OBBB).

5. Section 45U (Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT TERMINATION: Terminates credit for electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2032.

6. Terminated Credits and Deductions

SECTION 45V (CLEAN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT): The deadline for beginning construction under §45V is moved up to December 31, 2027 (instead of December 31, 2032).

EV RELATED CREDITS: Credits for EVs and EV charging property are eliminated.

The deadlines for acquiring an eligible vehicle under §§ 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit), 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), and 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit) are moved up to September 30, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

The deadline for PIS under § 30C (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property) is moved up to June 30, 2026 (instead of December 31, 2032).

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.

The PIS deadline for residential clean energy property under § 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit) of December 31, 2034, is replaced with a deadline for incurring expenditures of December 31, 2025.

The deadline for PIS for energy efficiency improvements, residential energy property expenditures and home energy audits under § 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) is December 31, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

REPEAL OF 5-YEAR MACRS: Removes the ability to utilize 5-year MACRS schedules under § 168 for “energy property” described in § 48.

Property eligible for a credit under §§ 45Y and 48E would remain eligible for 5-year MACRS.

ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS DEDUCTION: Deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings is eliminated by adding a new BOC deadline of June 30, 2026.

II. NEW FEOC RESTRICTIONS

1. Key Definitions

PROHIBITED FOREIGN ENTITY (“PFE”): Means any “Specified Foreign Entity” or “Foreign-Influenced Entity”.

Generally, determination is made as of the last day of each taxable year.

For the first taxable year beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB), determination is made as of the first date of such taxable year (except with respect to status as a “Foreign-Controlled Entity”).

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITY (“SFE”): A “specified foreign entity” means:

a foreign entity of concern described in subparagraph (A), (B), (D), or (E) of section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283; 15 U.S.C. 4651),

an entity included on a list required by clause (i), (ii), (iv), (iv) of section 2(d)(2)(B) of Public Law 117-78 (135 Stat. 1527),

a foreign-controlled entity.

FOREIGN-CONTROLLED ENTITY:

A “foreign-controlled entity” means:

the government (including any level of government below the national level) of a covered nation;

an agency or instrumentality of a government described in the immediately preceding bullet;

a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, provided that such person is not an individual who is a citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident of the United States;

an entity or a qualified business unit (as defined in § 989(a)) incorporated or organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation; or

other than certain publicly traded entities, an entity (including subsidiary entities) controlled by an entity described in the foregoing bullets.

For purposes of this definition, “control” means, (i) in the case of a corporation, ownership (by vote or value) of more than 50% of the stock of such corporation, (ii) in the case of a partnership, ownership of more than 50% of the profits interests or capital interests in such partnership, or (iii) in any other case, ownership of more than 50% of the beneficial interests in the entity.

For purposes of this definition, “covered nation” has the same meaning given such term under 10 U.S.C. 4872(f)(2) (e., means the Democratic People’s republic of North Korea, the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the Islamic Republic of Iran).

FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITY (“FIE”):

Other than certain publicly traded entities, an entity with respect to which, during the taxable year,

A specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer of such entity,

“Covered Officer” means, with respect to an entity: (i) a member of the board of directors, board of supervisors, or equivalent governing body; (ii) an executive-level officer, including the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, or senior vice president; or (iii) an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or members described in the foregoing bullets.

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity,

One or more specified foreign entities own, in the aggregate, at least 40% of such entity, or

At least 15% of the debt of such entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more specified foreign entities, or

Which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity (or an entity related to such specified foreign entity) to exercise effective control over:

Any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), or

With respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (i) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (ii) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

The term “taxpayer” for purposes of the FIE rules includes any person related to the taxpayer.

ATTRIBUTION RULE: For purposes of the definition of a PFE (and the subsidiary definitions), ownership is determined by taking into account the attribution rules under § 318(a)(2) for purposes of determining ownership of stock in a corporation and with similar principles being applied for non-corporate entities.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL:

“Effective Control” means one or more agreements or arrangements similar to those described in the following bullets (relating to determination prior to the issuance of guidance and licensing arrangements) which provide one or more contractual counterparties of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held which are described in the definition of “foreign-influenced entity”.

During any period prior to the date that guidance has been issued by Treasury, the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to:

Determine the quantity determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;

Determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer or the storage of electrical energy in energy storage technology of the taxpayer;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer that produces eligible components;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer;

Restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty; or

On an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity, or

With respect to a licensing agreement for the provision of intellectual property (or any other contract, agreement or other arrangement entered into with a contractual counterparty related to such licensing agreement) with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible component:

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to specify or otherwise direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized in a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct the operation of any qualified facility, any energy storage technology, or any production unit that produces an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to limit the taxpayer’s utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar agreement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions thereof);

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions thereof);

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or a specified foreign entity; or

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

BEGINNING OF CONSTRUCTION (BOC):

Generally, determined pursuant to rules similar to rules under IRS Notice 2013-29 and IRS Notice 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.

Treasury is directed to prescribed regulations and guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent circumvention of the subparagraph relating to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, including the prevention of any evasion with respect to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio “where the fact demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.”

2. Credit Disallowance

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITIES AND FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITIES: Prevents “Specified Foreign Entities” and “Foreign-Influenced Entities” from claiming the credit.

SFE restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

Credits Impacted: §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Z, 45Q, 45X, and 45U.

FIE restriction applies to:

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB) for §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Q, and 45X.

“Effective Control” is carved out from the FIE restriction for §§ 45Y, 48E and 45X.

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 for §§ 45Z and 45U.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL: Prevents taxpayers subject to “effective control” by a “specified foreign entity” for a given taxable year from claiming credits if the effective control determination was made with respect to a qualified facility, an energy storage technology, or an eligible component (as applicable).

Applies to §§ 45Y, 48E, and 45X for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Credits under §§ 45X ,45Y and 48E are disallowed if the taxpayer receives material assistance from a PFE.

Applies to facilities that BOC after December 31, 2025, for §§ 45Y and 48E.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, for § 45X.

Determination of whether the taxpay received “material assistance” is discussed below in Section II.3.

APPLICABLE PAYMENTS: For any ITC allowed in a taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 (e., after two years following the enactment of OBBB), recapture of 100% of any allowed ITC is required if an “applicable payment” (defined by cross-reference to payments that trigger “effective control”) is made to a “Prohibited Foreign Entity” within 10-years of placement in service of the facility.

3. Material Assistance

CALCULATION OF RATIO: Requires calculation of a percentage, the numerator of which is direct costs not attributable to PFEs and the denominator of which is all direct costs.

For Qualifying Facilities and Energy Storage Technologies under §§ 45Y and 48E, the calculation focuses on Manufactured Products (including components) and can be expressed as:

For eligible components under § 45X, the calculation focuses on direct material costs related to the production of eligible components and can be expressed as:

QUALIFIED FACILITIES AND ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY (§45Y/§48E): Requires an increasing amount of a facility’s manufactured products NOT to be manufactured by PFEs based on the beginning of construction date of the qualified facility or energy storage technology. This calculation is called the “Material Assistance Cost Ratio”.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

Material Assistance Cost Ratio calculations include qualified interconnection property (as defined in §48E(b)(4)).

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Qualified Facilities:

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Energy Storage Technology:

ELIGIBLE COMPONENTS (§45X): Requires an increasing amount of an eligible component’s direct material costs NOT to be mined, produced, or manufactured by PFEs based on the year the eligible component is sold.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after the enactment of OBBB).

Solar Energy Components:

Wind Energy Components:

Battery Components:

Critical Minerals*:

*Subject to increase by Treasury no later than December 31, 2027, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs and national security concerns

GUIDANCE ON CALCULATION: Prior to promulgation of new guidance from Treasury (required by December 31, 2026), for purposes of calculating the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, the statute permits reliance on:

IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to certain safe harbors for domestic content adder calculations), but scope of such reliance is not yet clear; and

[Akin Note: This guidance only applies to §§ 45Y and 48E projects, and thus there is no current guidance for calculation of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio in the context of § 45X credits.

4. Audit and Penalty Provisions

EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Extends the statute of limitations from three to six years for assessing deficiencies related to the material assistance rules.

REDUCED PENALTY THRESHOLD: Reduces the threshold from 10% to 1% for the threshold to assess penalties related to a substantial understatement of income tax if the cause is an overstatement of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio with respect to the determination of credits under §§ 45Y, 48E or 45X.

NEW SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION PENALTY: Creates a new penalty based on inaccurate supplier certifications that result in a disallowance of credit.

Penalty applies where:

the certifying person knew or reasonably should have known that (A) the certification was inaccurate and (B) the certification would be used in connection with a credit determination; and

the disallowance exceeds the lesser of (x) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year to be shown on the return and (y) $100,000.

Penalty is the greater of (x) 10% of the underpayment and (y) $5,000.

In executive order, Trump delivers on promise to ‘deal with’ wind and solar In an executive order on Monday, President Trump directed the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” restricting which projects will still qualify for wind and solar tax credits.","Copper traders and producers have anticipated tariffs on copper since Trump announced in February that his administration would investigate the national security implications of copper imports, calling the metal an “essential material for national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience.”

Trump has already imposed tariffs for similarly strategically and economically important metals such as steel and aluminum. The process for imposing these tariffs under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 involves a finding by the Secretary of Commerce that the product being tariffed is essential to national security, and thus that the United States should be able to supply it on its own.

Copper has been referred to as the “metal of electrification” because of its centrality to a broad array of electrical technologies, including transmission lines, batteries, and electric motors. Electric vehicles contain around 180 pounds of copper on average. “Copper, scrap copper, and copper’s derivative products play a vital role in defense applications, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, including clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics,” the White House said in February.

Copper prices had risen around 25% this year through Monday. Prices for copper futures jumped by as much as 17% after the tariff announcement and are currently trading at around $5.50 a pound.

The tariffs, when implemented, could provide renewed impetus to expand copper mining in the United States. But tariffs can happen in a matter of months. A copper mine takes years to open — and that’s if investors decide to put the money toward the project in the first place. Congress took a swipe at the electric vehicle market in the U.S. last week, extinguishing subsidies for both consumers and manufacturers as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. That will undoubtedly shrink domestic demand for EV inputs like copper, which could make investors nervous about sinking years and dollars into new or expanded copper mines.

Even if the Trump administration succeeds in its efforts to accelerate permitting for and construction of new copper mines, the copper will need to be smelted and refined before it can be used, and China dominates the copper smelting and refining industry.

The U.S. produced just over 1.1 million tons of copper in 2023, with 850,000 tons being mined from ore and the balance recycled from scrap, according to United States Geological Survey data. It imported almost 900,000 tons.

With the prospect of tariffs driving up prices for domestically mined ore, the immediate beneficiaries are those who already have mines. Shares in Freeport-McMoRan, which operates seven copper mines in Arizona and New Mexico, were up over 4.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.

More than 100 people — many of them children — ultimately died as extreme rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to rise 34 feet in 90 minutes. But the tragedy was “not really a failure of meteorology,” UCLA and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources climate scientist Daniel Swain said during a public “Office Hours” review of the disaster on Monday. The National Weather Service in San Antonio and Austin first warned the public of the potential for heavy rain on Sunday, June 29 — five days before the floods crested. The agency followed that with a flood watch warning for the Kerrville area on Thursday, July 3, then issued an additional 21 warnings, culminating just after 1 a.m. on Friday, July 4, with a wireless emergency alert sent to the phones of residents, campers, and RVers along the Guadalupe River.

The NWS alerts were both timely and accurate, and even correctly predicted an expected rainfall rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour. If it were possible to consider the science alone, the official response might have been deemed a success.

Of all the storm systems, convective storms — like thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes, and extreme rainstorms — are some of the most difficult to forecast. “We don’t have very good observations of some of these fine-scale weather extremes,” Swain told me after office hours were over, in reference to severe meteorological events that are often relatively short-lived and occur in small geographic areas. “We only know a tornado occurred, for example, if people report it and the Weather Service meteorologists go out afterward and look to see if there’s a circular, radial damage pattern.” A hurricane, by contrast, spans hundreds of miles and is visible from space.

Global weather models, which predict conditions at a planetary scale, are relatively coarse in their spatial resolution and “did not do the best job with this event,” Swain said during his office hours. “They predicted some rain, locally heavy, but nothing anywhere near what transpired.” (And before you ask — artificial intelligence-powered weather models were among the worst at predicting the Texas floods.)

Over the past decade or so, however, due to the unique convective storm risks in the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other meteorological agencies have developed specialized high resolution convection-resolving models to better represent and forecast extreme thunderstorms and rainstorms.

NOAA’s cutting-edge specialized models “got this right,” Swain told me of the Texas storms. “Those were the models that alerted the local weather service and the NOAA Weather Prediction Center of the potential for an extreme rain event. That is why the flash flood watches were issued so early, and why there was so much advanced knowledge.”

Writing for The Eyewall, meteorologist Matt Lanza concurred with Swain’s assessment: “By Thursday morning, the [high resolution] model showed as much as 10 to 13 inches in parts of Texas,” he wrote. “By Thursday evening, that was as much as 20 inches. So the [high resolution] model upped the ante all day.”

To be any more accurate than they ultimately were on the Texas floods, meteorologists would have needed the ability to predict the precise location and volume of rainfall of an individual thunderstorm cell. Although models can provide a fairly accurate picture of the general area where a storm will form, the best current science still can’t achieve that level of precision more than a few hours in advance of a given event.

Climate change itself is another factor making storm behavior even less predictable. “If it weren’t so hot outside, if it wasn’t so humid, if the atmosphere wasn’t holding all that water, then [the system] would have rained and marched along as the storm drifted,” Claudia Benitez-Nelson, an expert on flooding at the University of South Carolina, told me. Instead, slow and low prevailing winds caused the system to stall, pinning it over the same worst-case-scenario location at the confluence of the Hill Country rivers for hours and challenging the limits of science and forecasting.

Though it’s tempting to blame the Trump administration cuts to the staff and budget of the NWS for the tragedy, the local NWS actually had more forecasters on hand than usual in its local field office ahead of the storm, in anticipation of potential disaster. Any budget cuts to the NWS, while potentially disastrous, would not go into effect until fiscal year 2026.

The proposed 2026 budget for NOAA, however, would zero out the upkeep of the models, as well as shutter the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, which studies thunderstorms and rainstorms, such as the one in Texas. And due to the proprietary, U.S.-specific nature of the high-resolution models, there is no one coming to our rescue if they’re eliminated or degraded by the cuts.

The impending cuts are alarming to the scientists charged with maintaining and adjusting the models to ensure maximum accuracy, too. Computationally, it’s no small task to keep them running 24 hours a day, every day of the year. A weather model doesn’t simply run on its own indefinitely, but rather requires large data transfers as well as intakes of new conditions from its network of observation stations to remain reliable. Although the NOAA high-resolution models have been in use for about a decade, yearly updates keep the programs on the cutting edge of weather science; without constant tweaks, the models’ accuracy slowly degrades as the atmosphere changes and information and technologies become outdated.

It’s difficult to imagine that the Texas floods could have been more catastrophic, and yet the NOAA models and NWS warnings and alerts undoubtedly saved lives. Still, local Texas authorities have attempted to pass the blame, claiming they weren’t adequately informed of the dangers by forecasters. The picture will become clearer as reporting continues to probe why the flood-prone region did not have warning sirens, why camp counselors did not have their phones to receive overnight NWS alarms, why there were not more flood gauges on the rivers, and what, if anything, local officials could have done to save more people. Still, given what is scientifically possible at this stage of modeling, “This was not a forecast failure relative to scientific or weather prediction best practices. That much is clear,” Swain said.

As the climate warms and extreme rainfall events increase as a result, however, it will become ever more crucial to have access to cutting-edge weather models. “What I want to bring attention to is that this is not a one-off,” Benitez-Nelson, the flood expert at the University of South Carolina, told me. “There’s this temptation to say, ‘Oh, it’s a 100-year storm, it’s a 1,000-year storm.’”

“No,” she went on. “This is a growing pattern.”

2. 17% of the continental U.S. now has restrictions or bans on wind and solar development: Heatmap analysis

The development of new wind and solar power plants is “now heavily restricted or outright banned in about one in five counties across the country,” according to a major new survey of public records and local ordinances by my colleagues Robinson Meyer and Charlie Clynes. Their report found bans and restrictions — such as a rule that wind turbines must be placed a certain number of miles from homes, or that solar farms cannot take up more than 1% of a county’s agricultural land — in a total of 605 U.S. counties, including at least 59 municipalities in the more-renewables-friendly Northeast. In total, the bans and restrictions on renewables cover approximately 17% of the continental United States’ total land mass.

Robinson and Charlie’s findings have not been previously reported, and their research involved calling thousands of counties where laws, in some cases, were not in existing public databases. You can access the full project- and county-level data and associated risk assessments via Heatmap Pro, here.

3. In executive order, Trump delivers on promise to ‘deal with’ wind and solar

In an executive order on Monday, President Trump directed the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” restricting which projects will still qualify for wind and solar tax credits. The order builds on the repeal of renewable energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which had stipulated that such projects would need to begin construction within a year and come online by 2028 to be eligible for the subsidies. Now the government will take a stricter approach to defining “the beginning of construction” to prevent “the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” by limiting credits to projects in which “a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Freedom Caucus members had described the tax credits as a sticking point during their late negotiations over the bill. As my colleagues Jael Holzman and Katie Brigham previously reported, North Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman alluded to a conversation with Trump in which the president had assured him that he was “going to deal with [the tax credits] in his own way.” It appears the executive order is the follow-through on that promise. Additionally, Trump’s executive order called for the Department of the Interior to determine whether any of its policies, practices, or regulations “provide preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources” and revise them accordingly.

4. DOE resource report warns of blackouts, ‘overreliance on intermittent energy sources’

An Energy Department report released Monday warned that blackouts in the U.S. could “increase by 100% in 2030” if the country continues to close its coal and natural gas power plants. The report, completed at the direction of an April executive order by President Trump, anticipates 209 gigawatts of new generation by 2030 to replace 104 gigawatts of retirements — but “only 22 gigawatts would come from firm baseload generation sources,” so that, “even assuming no retirements, the model found increased risk of outages in 2030 by a factor of 34.” The DOE concluded that the U.S. grid “will not be able to sustain the combined impact of coal and other plant closures, an overreliance on intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, and data center growth, highlighting the urgency of increasing dispatchable energy output.”

The DOE’s report sets the stage for the department to continue to prevent the phase-out of old fossil fuel power plants and open new facilities. Many are skeptical of the agency’s logic, however, pointing to renewable-heavy grid success stories like Texas. The Department of Energy “appears to exaggerate the risk of blackouts and undervalue the contributions of entire resource classes, like wind, solar, and battery storage,” Caitlin Marquis, the managing director at Advanced Energy United, said, per Axios.

5. Trump threatens South Korea, Japan with 25% tariffs

On Monday, the Trump administration sent letters to 14 countries warning them they’ll face tariffs of up to 40% if they don’t reach a trade deal with the U.S. by an August 1 deadline. Significantly, automaking giants Japan and South Korea — which each account for about 4% of U.S. imports, per The New York Times — were among the recipients, and face 25% tariffs according to the letters. As my colleague Jael Holzman previously reported, Japan in particular had been “positioned to be an ally in U.S. efforts to wean off China-linked minerals and signed a minerals trade agreement under Biden,” with the imposition of such tariffs potentially threatening to tank America’s own “mineral supply chain renaissance.”

Chemical Lobby’s Delay Tactics Rejected, but EPA Must Remain Vigilant to Protect Public Health from Asbestos Hazards

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a significant and overdue course correction, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has withdrawn its plan to rewrite or delay the Biden-era ban on chrysotile asbestos, the last form of asbestos still legally in use in the United States. This shift comes after widespread public criticism and mounting pressure from health advocates, scientists and environmental justice leaders demanding that the agency prioritize lives over lobbyists.

Just weeks ago, EPA signaled its intent to stall this life-saving regulation, in what appeared to be a direct concession to chemical industry interests. At the center of that maneuver was a court filing by Lynn Ann Dekleva, Deputy Assistant Administrator for EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and a former policy director at the American Chemistry Council, the trade group whose members stand to profit from regulatory rollbacks.

That move would have suspended the asbestos ban for years, prolonging exposure to a known carcinogen responsible for an estimated 40,000 deaths annually in the United States. The reversal represents a hard-won reprieve, but the original filing and its motivations reveal a disturbing pattern of regulatory capture and political interference.

“While the withdrawal of this delay is a step in the right direction, it was never voluntary. The agency moved only after facing fierce public pressure and legal accountability,” said Michelle Roos, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Network. “Let’s be clear: the original decision to delay this ban was a gift to chemical lobbyists, not a science-based policy choice. One down, 30 to go. This is just the beginning of the public backlash against the Trump administration’s plans to roll back 31 standards that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.”

In formal comments submitted to EPA in June 2024, the Environmental Protection Network endorsed the agency’s determination that asbestos, including legacy uses and disposal, poses an unreasonable risk to human health. EPN emphasized that many workers remain dangerously unprotected due to outdated or unenforced OSHA standards, and highlighted the urgent need for strong federal action to prevent persistent, preventable exposures. The resulting 2024 rule, issued under the amended Toxic Substances Control Act, was the most robust federal measure in decades to phase out chrysotile asbestos in commercial and industrial applications. It affirmed what science has long made clear: there is no safe level of asbestos exposure. The now-withdrawn proposal would have undermined key provisions of that rule, particularly those restricting use in chlorine manufacturing and industrial gaskets, sectors where safer alternatives already exist.

The Environmental Protection Network reaffirms that any further attempt to weaken or delay this ban must be met with unified resistance and warns that this reversal does not mark the end of the administration’s broader deregulatory agenda. It is part of a disturbing pattern of catering to corporate polluters at the expense of human health, environmental safety, and scientific integrity.

“We’re not standing by; we’re standing up,” Roos added. “This administration has shown that it will try to dismantle as many protections as it can get away with. But, every time that they move to put polluters before people, we will push back — loudly, strategically, relentlessly — because it works, in the courts and in the streets. Public health is not up for negotiation.”

In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.
However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits.
The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits.
Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBB), which significantly rolls back many of the core tax incentives that clean energy projects have relied on since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Under the new law, tax credits for wind and solar projects phase out much sooner. To qualify, these projects must either be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction within the next 12 months. This compressed timeline will likely force developers to accelerate their project schedules or risk losing critical tax credits. In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.

However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, and limited to electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing tax credits, these “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules have now been expanded under the OBBB to cover virtually all tax credits. The expanded FEOC rules deny credits to projects that are owned or controlled by certain foreign entities — or that purchase components from or make payment to these foreign entities. Notably, the list of FEOCs includes all companies owned or controlled by the Chinese government or its citizens.

Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects face a shorter window to qualify for tax credits. Projects that were under construction by the end of 2024 are largely unaffected by the new law. Projects first starting construction in 2025 must generally comply with the FEOC ownership requirements, and projects beginning construction in 2026 or later must navigate a complex set of FEOC sourcing and payment rules, including proving that an increasing share of components are sourced outside of China.

Going forward, a key factor for most clean energy projects will be the date they begin construction, as this will determine both their eligibility for tax credits and the extent to which they must comply with the FEOC rules. Over the past 12 years, the IRS has issued a series of notices that define what it means for a project to be “under construction” along with related rules on transfers and completion deadlines. The OBBB clarifies that this existing guidance continues to apply for purposes of the effective date of the “material assistance” FEOC rules described below.

However, the Trump administration issued an executive order on July 7, 2026, directing the US Treasury department to revisit the begun construction rules with respect to solar and wind facilities within 45 days, including by “restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” These guidelines (and the extent to which they are changed for solar and wind) are now likely to become central to how developers assess the value of their pipelines and plan future investments. Many in the industry will now rely on these IRS rules to guide investment decisions and accelerate project timelines, as construction start dates become a critical factor in securing favorable tax treatment under the new law.

This Client Alert provides a detailed description of the OBBB’s changes to the tax credits across different technologies and the FEOC rules.

Solar and Wind ITC and PTC

Projects that began construction before 2025 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. Projects that start construction in 2025 or later are eligible under existing law for tax credits that are similar to the investment tax credit (ITC) or production tax credit (PTC) and referred to as “technology neutral credits.” Most of the restrictions in the new law related to renewables are aimed at curtailing these technology neutral credits.

Despite the technology neutral focus of existing law, solar and wind are subject to different — and harsher — treatment under the OBBB than other technologies. Projects have to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. Under pre-OBBB law, projects beginning construction in 2025 or 2026 would have until the end of 2029 or the end of 2030, respectively, to be placed in service, or else their developers must demonstrate that work is continuous based on the facts.

Solar and wind projects, as well as other projects eligible for technology neutral tax credits, will also become subject to the FEOC requirements, which are described in further detail below.

Helpfully, the OBBB does not affect eligibility for tax credit adders (e.g., for projects located in an energy community or that meet domestic content requirements), eligibility for accelerated depreciation, the ability to transfer tax credits to third parties for cash, or place restrictions on residential solar leasing. Restrictions on the latter three had been proposed in prior iterations of the bill. The final bill focuses the leasing restriction on solar water heating property or small wind energy property.

Although the domestic content tax credit bonus is retained, the OBBB fixes an apparent glitch from the Inflation Reduction Act that would have increased the qualification threshold to up to 55% over time for PTC projects but left the ITC threshold static at 40%. ITC projects that began construction before June 16, 2025, can still rely on a 40% threshold, but projects seeking to claim a domestic content adder that began construction after that date must meet a domestic content threshold of 45%, with increasing annual thresholds that match the PTC version thereafter.

Storage and Other Technologies Eligible for the ITC and PTC

Non-solar and wind technologies (e.g., storage, hydropower, and geothermal) fare much better under the OBBB. Tax credits for these projects are subject to a phase-down schedule that begins for projects that commence construction after 2033. Projects beginning construction in 2034 and 2035 will still qualify for tax credits but with a 75% and 50% haircut, respectively. These projects must meet the traditional continuity test, which requires placement in service by the end of the fourth year after the end of the year in which construction starts, or else demonstrate that construction was continuous based on the facts.

Fuel cells (including linear generators) were added as a special category of ITC-eligible technology. Fuel cell projects generally involve some level of greenhouse gas emissions, which would make them ineligible for the technology neutral ITC pre-OBBB. They are newly eligible for a 30% ITC without regard to emissions and are also exempt from prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. They cannot qualify for tax credit adders. Eligibility begins for projects that start construction after 2025.

Clean Fuels

The OBBB significantly modifies the section 45Z PTC for clean transportation fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is extended by two years to cover fuel sold through December 31, 2029, but reduces the value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon beginning for fuel produced after 2025. The OBBB also eliminates the excise tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel with respect to any sale or use after September 30, 2025, and prohibits double counting by barring 45Z credits on any fuel produced from fuel that would have qualified for 45Z credits on its own. Fuel feedstock will have to come from the United States, Mexico, or Canada to qualify for a credit.

The new law forecloses the possibility of claiming additional 45Z credits based on “negative emissions.” The credit amount is calculated according to the “emissions factor” of the fuel, with a floor of 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU to qualify. The greater the emissions rate, the smaller the emissions factor and the smaller the tax credit. Conversely, if the emissions rate is negative, prior law appears to allow taxpayers to claim a credit above $1.00 for clean fuel and above $1.75 for sustainable aviation fuel. The OBBB prevents this result.

The OBBB also restores the expired tax credit under section 40A for small agri-biodiesel producers through 2026 and increases the credit amount from 10 cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon. The tax credit will be newly eligible to be sold to third parties for cash.

As described in further detail below, projects intending to claim 45Z credits will become subject to FEOC ownership restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture receives relatively favorable treatment under the OBBB compared to other credits. The credit is available for carbon dioxide that is captured and then permanently sequestered, used in enhanced oil recovery, or put to another commercial use. The credit amount had been higher for a sequestration use case compared to the others on the theory that sequestration is uneconomic without the tax incentive. The OBBB puts all use cases on equal footing so that both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for a credit of up to $85 per metric ton (or more in the case of direct air capture).

Similar to the 45Z tax credit for clean fuels, projects will become subject to the ownership-related FEOC restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit

The OBBB makes numerous changes to the section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which provides a tax credit for the production and sale of certain solar, wind, and battery components, as well as the production and purification of certain critical minerals. Among other changes, the OBBB:

terminates the tax credit for wind components sold after 2027;

creates a new category of eligible critical minerals for “metallurgical coal”;

begins phasing out tax credits for critical mineral production (other than metallurgical coal, which terminates after 2029) after 2030, with termination after 2033;

subjects manufacturers to similar FEOC rules as those that apply to the technology neutral ITC and PTC; and

requires battery modules to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment,” as a condition for tax credit eligibility.

Metallurgical coal is unique compared to the other critical minerals in that it is allowed to be produced outside of the United States. Federal tax credit eligibility in general, even outside of the critical minerals context, usually requires the activity being subsidized to occur in the United States. However, the credit is only worth 2.5% of the cost compared to 10% with respect to other critical minerals. The coal must be suitable for use in the production of steel.

Notably, the OBBB does not fully restrict the sale of integrated components, which had been proposed in the initial Senate bill. The initial Senate bill would have essentially prevented manufacturers of multiple components that are integrated into an end product from claiming credits on each individual component. Instead, the OBBB permits the stacking of credits provided that the components that are integrated together are produced in the same facility, the end product is sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65% of the direct material costs of the underlying components are attributable to US mining, production, or manufacturing.

Foreign Entities of Concern

The OBBB imposes important new restrictions limiting the ability of projects to generate tax credits if certain FEOCs are involved. These restrictions fall into two categories: (1) those relating to ownership or control, and (2) those relating to assistance during construction. To the extent an FEOC restriction contains a beginning of construction concept, the OBBB memorializes long-standing IRS guidance that allows a project owner to begin construction by either incurring 5% of project costs or else beginning physical work of a significant nature.

1. FEOC — Ownership Restrictions

The first FEOC restriction generally prohibits a project owner from claiming technology neutral tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, clean fuel production tax credits, and tax credits for carbon sequestration for any tax year in which the person otherwise generating the tax credit is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign influenced entity.” These restrictions generally apply to tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, though the restrictions relating to foreign-influenced entities do not restrict clean fuel production tax credits until tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Specified foreign entities should be relatively easy to identify. These include entities owned by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia; entities owned by citizens of those countries or otherwise organized or having a principal place of business in one of those countries; certain battery manufacturers; and certain other similar entities.

An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if: a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint board members or officers; a single specified entity owns more than 25% of the entity; one or more specified foreign entities owns an aggregate of 40% of the entity; or at least 15% of the entity’s debt is held by specified foreign entities (in the aggregate).

An entity is also a foreign-influenced entity if during the prior taxable year the entity made payments to a specified foreign entity pursuant to an arrangement that allowed the specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a project (in the case of technology neutral tax credits) or production of any components (in the case of advanced manufacturing tax credits). The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits. Because effective control requires examination of payments made in the prior taxable year, project owners should closely scrutinize any contract that requires a payment, or any payments recently made, which could provide a contractual counterparty with any specific authority over production of components, energy generation, or energy storage.

Contractual rights that allow a counterparty to determine the amount or timing of production, restrict access to data relating to production, determine the purchase of power output, or maintain or otherwise operate a project on an exclusive basis can create effective control. Effective control can also be granted by licensing arrangements that specify or direct material or other components in a project, allow the licensor to direct the operation of the project, limit the taxpayer’s use of the licensed property, provide a right to royalties for more than 10 years, or otherwise require the project owner to hire a project operator for more than two years at the licensor’s direction.

Finally, for projects claiming the technology neutral ITC, the OBBB imposes a recapture of 100% of the tax credit value if payments conveying effective control are made within 10 years of the project being placed in service.

2. FEOC — Material Assistance Rules

The second set of FEOC restrictions prohibits project owners from claiming technology neutral tax credits if construction on the project started after December 31, 2025, and the project receives material assistance from a specified foreign entity. A similar prohibition limits project owners from claiming advanced manufacturing tax credits for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2025, if the owner received material assistance from a specified foreign entity.

An entity receives material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity if the material assistance cost ratio applicable either to the power generation project or the manufacturing project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The applicable threshold percentages are shown in Exhibit A (below), which can be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury in the case of the applicable threshold relating to critical minerals.

The material assistance cost ratio for a power plant or battery is generally the difference between the total direct costs for manufactured products less the direct costs attributable to a specified foreign entity, divided by the total direct costs. This effectively examines the “good” costs over the total costs. The material assistance cost ratio for a manufactured component is the “good” material costs over the total material costs.

The OBBB directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue safe harbor tables applying a methodology similar to that adopted with respect to the calculation of domestic content under Notice 2025-08 for material assistance. Before these tables are issued, taxpayers can rely on Notice 2025-08 along with a supplier certification, though this has an obvious shortcoming in that Notice 2025-08 has tables for a limited subset of power production technologies. Developers of other technologies will have to rely on actual labor and materials costs to run the calculations.

Other Changes

The clean hydrogen PTC terminates for projects that begin construction after 2027. Prior iterations of the bill in both the House and Senate would have terminated the credit if construction did not begin by the end of 2025.

Bonus depreciation — the ability to write off 100% of the cost of certain business property, including renewables projects, as a depreciation deduction — is made permanent for property acquired after January 19, 2025. Bonus depreciation was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and was set to phase out after 2026 for most property. Taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation entirely or alternatively elect into a 40% bonus (or 60% bonus for property with a longer production period).

The PTC for nuclear facilities under 45U will become subject to the FEOC ownership restrictions.

Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026. The exact dates and mechanics vary by credit. Affected credits include the 30D clean vehicle credit, the 45W qualified commercial vehicles credit, the 30C credit for charging stations, and the residential clean energy credit under 25D.

Martin wanted to go further and link the homes with a small power grid that would let homeowners share surplus power with each other.","Hawaiian Electric Co.’s century-long hold on Hawaiʻi’s electricity market soon will change in a major way, creating a potential path to lower rates for businesses and residents.

Starting in 2027, HECO will be required to let independent electricity producers use its grid to deliver electricity directly to customers for a fee, potentially ending the utility’s standing as the sole choice for most electric consumers in the state. Under the current system, producers must sell electricity at a wholesale price to HECO, which pools it to sell to customers at a higher rate.

Gov. Josh Green signed the groundbreaking bill on Thursday, despite having previously signaled his intent to veto the measure.

It remains to be seen to what extent the new system will lead to significant savings for residential customers. A previously passed law allowing renters to buy power from community solar farms, for instance , has gone nowhere, hampered by what critics say are untenable rules. But even critics of the new law have said it could generate savings for some customers.

State Sen. Glenn Wakai, who chairs the Energy and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee and sponsored the bill, said the measure was meant to introduce competition in Hawaiʻi’s electricity market and reduce costs in a state where Hawaii%20has%20the%20highest%20average,highest%20share%20for%20any%20state."">customers pay the nation’s highest costs for electricity — more than three times the national average.

“We have for more than 100 years been at the mercy of HECO for our electricity needs, and we’ve seen in recent times that the delivery of that electricity has been very unreliable and very, very expensive,” Wakai said. “In the next two years, come 2027, all HECO’s customers will have an option of buying from someone other than HECO.”

“I think this is a game changer to benefit the consumers,” Wakai said.

Green’s office also expressed optimism.

“We believe that the provisions contained within the bill will allow for greater energy choice and hopefully a reduction in costs for Hawai‘i’s consumers,” Green’s spokeswoman, Makana McClellan, said in a written statement.

HECO spokesman Jim Kelly declined an interview request.

Law Could ‘Really Open Up Our Grid’

The law includes several provisions to break HECO’s hold on Hawaiʻi’s electricity market, but the most important involves what energy experts call wheeling.

Under the current system, developers build big wind and solar farms and sell the power to HECO under long-term contracts. HECO pays as little as 8 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity from these independent power producers, said Jeff Mikulina, a renewable energy consultant who was an architect of the law requiring Hawaiʻi to produce all of the electricity sold in the state from renewable resources by 2045.

Meanwhile, HECO charges residential customers on Oʻahu almost 43 cents per kilowatt hour. Big Island residents pay 48 cents.

Wakai said a goal of the law is to enable customers to pay closer to what the renewable electricity costs HECO to buy and to encourage smaller players to get in the game.

The wheeling provision does this by letting independent electricity producers pay a set fee to use HECO’s grid to deliver power to customers. Although wheeling has long been allowed on the mainland, it’s been prohibited by law in Hawaiʻi.

The PUC had been investigating a proposal to allow wheeling between government entities only, and Green’s intent-to-veto statement pointed to that as a reason to veto the broader bill. Green decided to sign the broad bill after the PUC said it would cancel the intra-governmental wheeling inquiry, McClellan said.

Hawaiʻi’s previous prohibition against wheeling has played out on the ground at places like Green Homes Hanalei, a cluster of seven homes in west Oʻahu built in 2017 around the idea of using solar and storage to make the subdivision as energy self-sufficient as possible.

Developer R.J. Martin powered each home with photovoltaic solar cells combined with two Tesla Powerwall batteries. Each home had garages with chargers for electric vehicles.

Martin wanted to go further and link the homes with a small power grid that would let homeowners share surplus power with each other. But he quickly learned that would be illegal. Homeowners would have to become regulated utilities to share surplus electricity with their neighbors.

“No one in their right mind is going to go through that exercise,” Wakai said. “So now, it just simplifies what has been all these walls and impediments put up by the government as well as by HECO.”

Martin hopes the new law will enable him to do something more innovative in the near future: use renewables and perhaps a microgrid to power a larger, workforce housing subdivision he’s planning for West Oʻahu.

But much will depend on how the Hawaiʻi Public Utilities Commission implements the law, Mikulina said.

“If the PUC does it right, it can really open up our grid to some innovative renewable solutions,” Mikulina said. “This could catalyze renewable growth and really help folks who need access to this.”

Critics Say Some Could Be Left Out

Critics point to potential unintended consequences.

A major issue involves equity. The concern is that HECO customers with the money and wherewithal to partner with an independent power producer will defect from HECO, leaving those less well-off to still deal with higher rates.

Testifying against the bill, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260, which works on utility infrastructure, argued the long-term technical effects of wheeling on HECO’s grid are unknown.

“Further,” the union wrote, “the fixed-cost of operating and maintaining the system will remain unchanged and passed on to those left in the system, essentially increasing the cost of electricity to those who can least afford it.”

Given this risk, it will be key to make sure lower-income residential customers can benefit as the commission creates rules governing the program, said Michael Colón, director of energy for the Ulupono Initiative, which supports the use of renewable energy.

To address such concerns, Wakai said, the law limits the size of a wind or solar farm allowed to use the wheeling provision to two megawatts, the size needed to power about 3,000 homes.

“We’re not talking about, you know, large 50- to 60-megawatt plants going and selling to all the Waikīkī hotels,” Wakai said. “That’s not going to be possible under this scenario.”

“What is possible under this scenario,” he said, “is, if you have let’s say 10 acres of land that can create two megawatts of power, you are free to go and sell to the nearby residents or wheel it across the island to someone who’s willing to take it.”

That’s promising news to people like Steve Mazur, director of commercial business development for RevoluSun, one of Hawaiʻi’s largest solar companies.

Mazur said he’s encountered business owners with energy hogging cold storage systems but small rooftops located near businesses with huge rooftops but little electricity needs. If implemented well by the PUC, Mazur said, the new law could make way for solar panels on the large roof to power the neighboring business.

,EPA,2025-07-08 20:37:29+00:00,Colorado Public Radio,Colorado has a new rule to limit gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric,"Sam Brasch, Tom Hesse, Tony Gorman, Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun, Olivia Bagan",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/08/gas-powered-lawn-tools-colorado-law-enforcement/,"A new state air quality rule went into effect on June 1, banning government entities from using small gas-powered lawn equipment during the summer ozone season.
Gas-powered lawn and garden equipment plays an outsized role in the perennial air quality problem.
Those entities are now restricted from using smaller gas-powered equipment such as leaf blowers, tillers and edgers from June 1 to August 31.
The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission could also reconsider whether to phase out the sale of handheld gas-powered lawn tools at Front Range retailers.
Air quality advocates want to better understand compliance with current lawn equipment rules before pushing for further restrictions.","At the start of the summer, Johnny Jimenez gathered the crews he manages at Designscapes Colorado, a commercial landscaping company headquartered in Centennial, a suburb south of Denver.

A new state air quality rule went into effect on June 1, banning government entities from using small gas-powered lawn equipment during the summer ozone season. Since the company holds contracts to maintain public parks, Jimenez told his workers all gas-powered, hand-held lawn equipment had to come off their trailers in favor of newly purchased electric leaf blowers and string trimmers.

“To put a battery-operated machine in their hand, it was kind of like a learning curve, and it still is a learning curve,” Jimenez recalled. “It's just trial and error. We have no choice.”

The switch comes as Colorado struggles to cut ground-level ozone pollution along the Front Range. The dangerous lung irritant — better known as smog — routinely climbs above federal health standards on summer afternoons. After decades of failing to fix the problem, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reclassified a nine-county region around metro Denver as a “severe” ozone violator in 2022.

Gas-powered lawn and garden equipment plays an outsized role in the perennial air quality problem. The lawn equipment rule — approved in 2023 — marks Colorado's most aggressive effort to address the pollution source so far, but the state is taking a “flexible” enforcement approach, prioritizing education and outreach over fines and other penalties.

The strategy has put Designscapes at the forefront of the transition to electric lawn care. Despite the lax enforcement approach, the company embraced the shift to win government contracts and satisfy residential customers bothered by the guttural roar of gas-powered equipment. It’s now figuring out whether battery-powered lawn care can work at a commercial scale.

New rules to mow down pollution

Gas-powered lawn equipment might be small, but the tools are a major pollution source because their engines effectively work as smog machines.

Many weed wackers and leaf blowers rely on two-stroke motors burning a combination of oil and gasoline. The resulting exhaust contains large amounts of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, the two key ingredients necessary to form ground-level ozone. Most mowers rely on cleaner four-stroke motors but lack emissions control systems like catalytic converters found in most cars.

One byproduct is some shocking air quality statistics. The California Air Resources Board estimates running a commercial leaf blower for a single hour emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a new car 1,100 miles from Los Angeles to Denver. Around metro Denver, the lawn tools emit more volatile organic compounds than all vehicles on the road, according to the Regional Air Quality Council, the leading air quality planning agency for the Front Range.

Air quality regulators adopted the new lawn care rules — known as Regulation 29 — in 2023. The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, a nine-member panel appointed by the governor, opted against more aggressive proposals supported by environmental advocates and local governments to ban the sale of gas-powered lawn equipment or directly regulate commercial companies.

It instead signed off on a plan to focus on public entities like school districts and city park departments. Those entities are now restricted from using smaller gas-powered equipment such as leaf blowers, tillers and edgers from June 1 to August 31.

But Michael Ogletree, Colorado’s senior director of air quality programs, said the state isn’t rushing to fine or punish anyone for failing to follow the rules.

“This is a new space we haven’t regulated in the past,” Ogletree said. “Right now, the way we’re working towards compliance is through education and outreach, and providing some flexibility if there are reasons why any particular entity can’t comply.”

Denver is one city taking advantage of extra breathing room. In a written statement, Stephanie Figueroa, a spokesperson for Denver Parks and Recreation, said her team “hasn’t purchased much equipment” because the city paused spending amid an ongoing major budget crunch.

Until those restrictions are lifted, Figueroa said her department will report usage of gas-powered tools to state authorities while it outlines a plan to transition to electric equipment.

A shift from gas cans to battery packs

Designscapes offers a preview of how governments across Colorado might adjust their operations to comply with the rules.

On a recent morning, a crew employed spanned out across Westlands Park in Greenwood Village, a 28-acre area packed with playgrounds and pavilions. The company still uses a gas-powered riding mower to cut large spaces, but switches to all-electric trimmers for smaller sections of weeds and grasses. Any debris on the sidewalks is then cleared with leaf blowers powered by a backpack stocked with batteries.

Brian Levins, the manager of the company’s landscaping operations, said Designscapes bought around $50,000 in electric equipment in anticipation of the new air quality rules. A $12,000 matching grant from the Regional Air Quality Council helped subsidize the purchase, and the equipment was further discounted by a 30 percent tax credit Colorado offers to offset the cost of electric lawn equipment.

“Reducing the noise, reducing the stress through all the vibration, reducing being exposed to those fumes all day — I thought that was a really positive thing to give to our team members,” Levins said.

The quieter equipment is appreciated by Jose Lara, the worker leading the crew maintaining the park. At the same time, he said he hopes battery technology continues to improve so he can work for longer stretches without trekking back to a trailer for a fully-charged pack.

More regulations could be on their way

After approving the new rules in 2023, Colorado air quality regulators plan to consider further regulations in November.

Those restrictions could include restricting commercial landscapers from using gas-powered equipment, not just public entities and their contractors. The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission could also reconsider whether to phase out the sale of handheld gas-powered lawn tools at Front Range retailers.

It’s unclear if the Gov. Jared Polis’ administration would support those policies. Ogletree, Colorado’s top air quality official, said his staff is in the early stages of researching the feasibility of different regulations given current market conditions and recent improvements in electric lawn care technology. The state hasn’t developed any formal proposal to offer commissioners later this year.

The landscaping industry is already gearing up to push back on anything it sees as too restrictive. Levins said Designscapes is glad it’s shifting to all-electric equipment, but he hopes regulators recognize other operators might lack the facilities and capital to manage a rapid transition.

“ There's just a lot of other costs that you don't necessarily think through when you first hear about these things. So for a smaller operator, I think it can be very, very burdensome,” Levins said.

Air quality advocates want to better understand compliance with current lawn equipment rules before pushing for further restrictions. Danny Katz, the executive director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, said it appears usage of gas-powered lawn tools remains common in parks and other public spaces. “Let’s get that right and then see what the next step is,” Katz said.

Other advocates want to see the state take decisive action. Elise Jones, the executive director of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, an environmental advocacy group, recently left her appointment on the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, where she pushed for more aggressive regulations to limit pollution from lawn equipment.

Jones said the state can’t hesitate to act if it wants to meet a mid-2027 deadline to comply with federal ozone standards, and should adopt plans to phase out gas-powered equipment from commercial lawncare companies and Front Range retailers.

“We'd all breathe easier if Colorado would step up and be a leader in transitioning away from noisy, polluting gasoline-powered lawn mowers, weed whackers and leaf blowers to clean, quiet electric-powered alternatives,” Jones said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250623_163630678-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:14:33.776990

The EV Tax Credit Panic: Dealers Scramble as Policy Shifts

When auto dealers start writing impassioned letters to Congress demanding to keep electric vehicle (EV) tax credits alive, it’s a clear sign the honeymoon phase of EV policy is over. Behind the public messaging of “going green” and “building the future,” a growing number of dealers and manufacturers are panicking — not because consumer demand is soaring, but because it’s not. The incentives have gone beyond promoting environmental goals; they’re propping up an industry shift that never had strong grassroots support in the first place.

Now, with the federal government poised to scale back or eliminate EV tax credits, parts of the automotive industry are scrambling. CarMax, Carvana, and several dealer groups are urging Congress to preserve the subsidies that have underwritten their investments in EV sales and service. Their plea is simple: without the $7,500 incentive on new EVs and $4,000 on used models, sales will slump. One Seattle-area dealer even warned of a 25–30% drop in EV sales.

Let’s be honest — this isn’t about saving the environment anymore. It’s about protecting profit margins and preserving political capital after years of lobbying silence. These same companies and their trade groups didn’t push back when mandates were being written into law. Now that the tide is turning, they want taxpayers to continue footing the bill for what is, at its core, a luxury purchase — typically made by high-income households with easy access to charging infrastructure. For most Americans, EVs remain unaffordable, and charging options are limited.

What’s Changing in Washington?

Congressional Republicans, backed by growing public skepticism of EV mandates, are working to remove the taxpayer-funded cushion that has made EVs appear more affordable than they actually are. The Senate version of the “Big Beautiful Bill” proposes ending EV tax credits by September 30, 2025 — three months earlier than the House version. The credits were originally set to expire in 2032.

Here’s what’s at stake:

New EVs (under $80,000): Up to $7,500 in tax credits

Used EVs (under $25,000): Up to $4,000 in tax credits

Automakers under the 200,000-EV threshold: Still qualify until 2026

But under Section 112002 of the Senate bill, these credits are set to be eliminated. Additionally, the bill includes a $250 annual registration fee for EVs and a $100 fee for hybrids and plug-in hybrids — meant to compensate for lost gas tax revenue used to maintain highways. It’s also a tacit acknowledgment that EV drivers aren’t currently paying their share for public roads, which are deteriorating across the country.

Too Little, Too Late?

Dealers and manufacturers had years to challenge the growing wave of federal mandates that funneled billions into EV production and infrastructure. They didn’t — because the gravy train was running. Generous government contracts, purchase incentives, and regulatory advantages made it too lucrative to raise objections.

Now, with the Trump administration signaling a sharp policy reversal, the industry wants the benefits to stay — even though the rules are changing.

But this is the cost of doing business. You don’t get to opt out of consequences now that the political winds have shifted. If customers want EVs, they’ll buy them.

That’s how the free market works. What we’re seeing is an attempt to artificially prop up demand with taxpayer dollars, even as surveys show most Americans still prefer internal combustion or hybrid vehicles. Cost, range anxiety, and lack of charging infrastructure remain major concerns.

A Judicial Speed Bump in the EV Rollback

In a twist that highlights the tangled relationship between politics and policy, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from halting EV infrastructure funds for 14 states. These funds — part of President Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — were designed to eliminate “range anxiety” by building a nationwide EV charging network.

The result? $5 billion spent, and only 7 EV chargers are live today — a staggering waste of taxpayer dollars.

U.S. District Judge Tana Lin ruled that withholding these funds exceeded federal authority. As a result, states like California, New York, and Colorado will see their EV infrastructure plans reinstated — for now. An appeal is underway, and many expect these funds to eventually be clawed back.

Still, the ruling doesn’t shift the larger momentum. Trump’s Department of Transportation has made its stance clear: the Biden-Buttigieg New Electric Vehicle Initiative was a failure — and it’s being dismantled.

Investor and Investment Media inquiries: 949-273-4990 ir@cetyinc.com Source: Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.","IRVINE, CA., July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETY) (the “Company” or “CETY”), a clean energy technology company offering power generation, waste to energy, battery storage, and heat to power solutions to deliver affordable, scalable, and eco-friendly energy, clean fuels, and alternative electricity for a sustainable future, is pleased to announce that its technologies should remain fully eligible for federal clean energy tax incentives following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025.

Under the new legislation, projects utilizing CETY’s waste heat-to-power, biomass combined heat and power (CHP), and battery storage technologies should continue to qualify for the most Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and Production Tax Credits (PTC) established by the Inflation Reduction Act—up to 30% ITC or 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour PTC—provided they meet updated requirements for zero greenhouse gas emissions, prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards.

“This legislation reinforces our competitive edge, said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Unlike solar, wind, EV, or hydrogen projects, many of which face new limitations, our technologies remain fully supported. This positions CETY as a premier opportunity for shareholders seeking exposure to resilient, profitable clean energy solutions.”

The OBBBA retains incentives for technologies like CETY’s when:

Projects began construction by December 31, 2024, qualifying them under existing IRA-era credits.

New projects meet stricter requirements under Section 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Credit) and Section 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Credit), including:

Demonstrated zero or net-negative lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions

Compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship guidelines

Use of U.S.-sourced components to satisfy domestic content rules

No participation by prohibited foreign entities of concern

The updated tax credits will gradually phase down starting in 2033 and sunset by the end of 2035, creating a limited window for investors and developers to capitalize on these incentives.

“As the energy landscape shifts, our waste heat recovery, biomass CHP, power generation, and battery storage solutions are essential for industrial and commercial facilities aiming to cut emissions and operating costs,” Kam Mahdi added. “Whether it’s converting agricultural or forestry waste into clean energy through biomass systems, capturing waste heat from industrial processes to generate power, tapping geothermal resources for sustainable electricity, or providing reliable power and storage for high-demand applications like data centers and crypto mining operations, CETY stands ready to deliver cutting-edge technologies that meet—and exceed—the federal government’s latest standards. CETY also anticipates curing Nasadq price deficiency by Novenmber 3rd , 2025.”

To clean energy advocates in California and around the country, that means consumers will pay more and the environment will suffer.

The credit for used EVs in particular is a “lost opportunity to reduce transportation energy burden and help California families save thousands of dollars in fuel costs,” said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, an education and advocacy nonprofit.

Conservatives have been eager to do away with the credit, saying it was little more than a subsidy for consumers who had no need for it.

“The hard-earned money of taxpaying Americans should not cover the cost for the luxuries of the nation’s elite,” said Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyoming.

The credits were enacted in 2022 as part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

The credits can help qualified buyers or lessees of electric vehicles, hybrid plug-in or fuel-cell-powered cars with a manufacturer’s suggested retail prices of $55,000 or less or vans, SUVs or trucks with an MSRP of $80,000 or less. The vehicle’s final assembly must be in North America.

Income limits on current tax breaks

The breaks are available on new vehicles to joint income tax filers with modified adjusted gross income under $300,000 and individuals with modified AGI under $150,000. The income limits to qualify for breaks on used vehicles are lower.

The bill had no Republican support, and many GOP lawmakers vowed to repeal it as soon as they could. They did just that in the Big Beautiful Bill, a sweeping tax and spending measure President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.

The repeal had strong backing from influential conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity.

“The Biden-era EV credits were a top-down policy that picked winners and losers, distorted markets and put upward pressure on consumer prices,” Faith Burns, the group’s energy policy fellow, told The Bee.

The Big Beautiful Bill, she said, “prioritizes unleashing American energy independence by reducing government overreach like these Biden-era credits for the wealthy.”

But Malmgren saw the repeal as putting pressure on California and other local governments.

“The repeal of the federal Clean Vehicle Tax Credits will increase the reliance on state and utility incentives to help consumers buy cleaner vehicles. This will particularly burden lower-income drivers and families since the federal incentives have been so successful at making electric vehicle purchase prices more affordable,” she said.

Would California backfill EV credits?

Weeks after Trump was elected, Gov. Gavin Newsom pledged to restart a statewide clean car rebate program if the new president yanked federal subsidies. Until 2023, the state offered up to $7,500 to purchase or lease electric, fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

But the governor has not laid out any specific plans and just signed a budget that closed a $12 billion deficit with no new money for EV incentives.

When asked for comment, Newsom’s office signaled that any new rebates would be tied to the governor’s push to reauthorize cap-and-trade, the program that sells emissions credits and reinvests the funds in climate projects.

“Pending these discussions, this could include new zero-emission vehicle incentives,” said Daniel Villaseñor, Newsom’s deputy communications director.

Sen. Ben Allen, D-Santa Monica, is skeptical.

“The challenge is that the cap-and-trade fund has been massively raided already,” said Allen, who chairs the Senate’s budget subcommittee on environmental spending. He pointed out Newsom shifted about $1 billion for Cal Fire funding from the General Fund to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund this year and wants to commit another $1 billion annually for high-speed rail.

“I’m very disappointed by the president’s decision” to end EV credits, Allen said. “I appreciated the governor’s initial reaction. At the same time, I’m also very cognizant of how limited resources are.”

During its 13-year lifespan, California’s clean car rebate program doled out nearly $1.5 billion in incentives, which helped residents buy more than 594,000 vehicles, according to state figures.

The rebate shut down two years ago as the state began prioritizing assistance for low-income households to purchase EVs.

The end of EV credits will “impact the market some,” said energy lobbyist Frank Maisano, but maybe less so in California where EVs have had a higher uptake than in other states.

“We are almost beyond the early adopters, especially in California, so incentives can be helpful to get new first-time EV owners, but it is still a struggle to get them in EVs because some people just don’t like the inconveniences that come with EVs,” he said.

The cost of a car

AAA has found that a new, compact EV costs about $600 more overall than a similar gasoline-powered car. It said the electricity needed to drive 15,000 miles annually in a compact EV costs an average of $546. A gasoline-powered car driven a similar distance would cost $1,255.

First looking at cost by using the same methodology as its annual Your Driving Costs study, AAA found that owning a new, compact electric vehicle was only slightly more expensive – about $600 annually - than its gas-powered counterpart. Although the overall costs are more, electric vehicles are lower in individual categories such as fuel and maintenance.

AAA found that because EVs don’t need as much maintenance – they don’t need oil changes, for instance – the cost for upkeep would be $330 less than the $949 annually a gasoline-powered car costs.

Their actions respond to numerous recent developments regarding NEPA, including President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” and the Council for Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) Interim Final Rule rescinding regulations purporting to implement NEPA. Their actions came days before the U.S. Congress revised NEPA as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which was signed into law on July 4, 2025.

Specifically, FERC issued Order No. 908, a Final Rule to remove references to now-rescinded CEQ NEPA regulations. It also released a Staff Guidance Manual on Implementation of NEPA (Manual) that outlines the updated procedures. The FERC Manual instructs the agency’s Staff and project applicants on:

Authorizations to adopt categorical exclusions (CatExs) approved by other agencies.

Submissions by natural gas and hydropower applicants on self-prepared Environmental Assessments (EAs).

Reliance by FERC on EAs and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) approved by other agencies.

Maintaining NEPA’s two-year EIS deadline.

Removing requirements to consider climate change and environmental justice in EAs and EISs.

While FERC’s rule changes in Order No. 908 are mostly ministerial, DOE published a more fulsome update to its NEPA implementing regulations in an Interim Final Rule, and requests comments by August 4, 2025.

FERC June 2025 NEPA Overhaul: Key Provisions

Order No. 908 follows the Interim Final Rule published by CEQ on February 25, 2025, to rescind its NEPA regulations,1 which fulfilled one directive in EO 14154, which also had directed federal agencies to streamline their permitting processes.2 Order No. 908 removes references in FERC’s regulations implementing NEPA to the rescinded CEQ regulations and adopts the Manual as the primary framework for NEPA compliance. Even though historically FERC treated executive orders and CEQ guidance as non-binding on it as an independent agency, it had treated CEQ’s published regulations as binding. FERC adopted Order No. 908 unanimously. The Manual introduces several procedural changes aimed at expediting environmental reviews, discussed below.

Deadlines

The Manual retains NEPA’s two-year statutory deadline for completing EISs. However, within a week of its publication, the U.S. Congress amended NEPA in the OBBBA to create an accelerated review process through payment of Project-Sponsor Opt-In Fees. Under Section 60062 of the OBBBA, project sponsors may fast-track NEPA review by paying CEQ a fee equal to 125% of the anticipated cost to prepare the EA or EIS. In return, EAs must be completed within 180 days of payment, and EISs within one year after the sponsor notifies CEQ of its intent to prepare an EIS. An expedited timeline potentially could limit opportunities for public comment and stakeholder engagement. Applicants should consider the possibility of expedited environmental reviews in financing, construction and parallel permitting plans.

Categorical Exclusions

The FERC Rule allows the agency to adopt other agencies’ CatExs, which exempt a class of actions from EA or EIS requirements based on a determination that the actions do not have a significant effect on the environment. To adopt other agencies’ CatExs, FERC must consult with the approving agency and provide public notice in the Federal Register. Current FERC CatExs provide streamlined permitting for projects such as water power projects, small conduit hydroelectric facility exemptions, and offshore platform abandonment, among others.3 Under the new guidance, we expect to see this list grow, particularly for routine or lower-impact infrastructure projects.

Applicant-Prepared Documents

Pursuant to the new rules, natural gas and hydropower applicants may prepare their own EAs or engage third-party contractors to prepare EAs or EISs to submit to FERC. This approach may lessen FERC’s internal workload, reduce backlogs and accelerate review times. It potentially allows applicants to have greater influence over the environmental reports.

Interagency Coordination

The Manual emphasizes early coordination with lead and cooperating agencies. It also allows FERC to rely on prior EAs or EISs prepared by other agencies or FERC staff when the proposed action is substantially similar, possibly accelerating review timelines. This approach may benefit projects that require multiple federal approvals by reducing duplicative reviews and fostering more consistency across agencies.

Climate Change and Environmental Justice

FERC no longer will consider climate change or environmental justice impacts in EAs or EISs, consistent with broader Trump administration policy.4 Several recent decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had scrutinized FERC’s review of environmental justice community impacts and this issue, along with greenhouse gas emissions upstream or downstream of the project footprint, had become a regular platform for challenging the agency review process, which Akin previously noted. For applicants, this change may ease permitting obstacles and expand the range of viable project locations.

DOE June 2025 NEPA Overhaul

The DOE Interim Final Rule rescinds many of the agency’s NEPA regulations and replaces them with NEPA Implementing Procedures. However, DOE retained regulations on CatExs, emergency circumstances and administrative exemptions from NEPA review. The Interim Final Rule also exempts Presidential permits from NEPA review, as such permits are “delegated Presidential action” and “Presidential actions are not subject to NEPA.” The Implementing Procedures aim to streamline environmental reviews by reducing EIS timelines from three to two years, limiting analysis to “reasonably foreseeable environmental effects,” adopting EAs, EISs and CatExs approved by other federal agencies and seeking to bypass the 30-day CEQ consultation for new CatExs when possible. The Interim Final Rule leans heavily into the May 2025 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado. As explained in a prior Akin client alert, the Court’s decision granted significant NEPA deference to agencies.

Next Steps

FERC’s revised NEPA framework complements FERC’s other recent efforts to expedite project approvals. These include actions taken by FERC in June to grant a one-year waiver of Order No. 871, which had implemented rules that delayed construction of natural gas facilities, and a two-year waiver raising the cost threshold for natural gas facility improvements requiring FERC approval.

Looking ahead, FERC’s revised NEPA procedures, along with changes made and proposed by DOE and other federal permitting agencies, are expected to accelerate project approvals, reduce administrative burdens and lower costs for both FERC and developers. While these changes signal a clear policy shift toward streamlining energy infrastructure development, project developers should still take steps to ensure that their permits are sufficient to withstand judicial scrutiny.

EU member states ask for cuts to deforestation rules

What’s the story?

Eighteen of the European Union’s 27 member states sent a letter July 7 asking the EU to scale back its upcoming deforestation rules, set to take effect in December. The countries argued the rules risked putting EU businesses at a competitive disadvantage.

Why does it matter?

The letter shows EU member states are divided over ESG rules and concerned that some policies may burden their economies.

According to Reuters:

Most European Union countries have demanded further changes to the bloc’s anti-deforestation law, saying some of its producers cannot be expected to meet its terms and face a competitive disadvantage, a letter seen by Reuters showed. …

Brussels has already delayed its launch by a year and cut back reporting rules following criticism from trading partners, including the United States, as well as from EU countries.

Of the EU’s 27 member countries, agriculture ministers from 18 wrote to the Commission on Monday, demanding the EU rules are not applied to countries deemed to have a low risk of deforestation. They should stick to national measures instead, they said.

European ESG investors seek alternatives to regulation

What’s the story?

Some European institutional investors—including Norwegian pension fund KLP—are promoting ESG through their asset allocations and potential legal action as the EU reduces regulations.

Why does it matter?

Investors are taking a larger role in promoting ESG standards, shifting influence from government oversight to the private sector.

According to Bloomberg:

Asset managers and asset owners based in northern Europe say they’re ready to cut allocations to companies they think are using a lack of regulations as an excuse to be less transparent about their ESG risks. In interviews with Bloomberg, they also say they’re ready to consider legal steps to protect their portfolios from climate change and human rights risks.

The development follows a major about-face in Europe, which has long been the biggest market for ESG, with more than 80% of the world’s sustainable fund assets. After taking an early lead on ESG, policymakers in the European Union are now significantly winding back earlier ambitions so that only a fraction of the companies once in scope still face sustainable reporting and due diligence requirements. …

Against that backdrop, European investors are now taking matters into their own hands. “We have engaged with several law firms to better understand how the changing political situation in the US will impact our rights as a minority shareholder and what potential risks we may face in exercising our active ownership efforts,” said Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at Norwegian pension fund KLP, which oversees about $114 billion.

Arkansas leads in anti-ESG laws

What’s the story?

Pleiades Strategy, a pro-ESG consultancy, published an annual report showing Arkansas led the nation in the number of anti-ESG bills passed since 2021.

Ballotpedia identified 12 anti-ESG bills enacted in Arkansas since 2021. Idaho, Louisiana, and Utah were tied for second with eight anti-ESG bills each.

On the other side, California had the most pro-ESG bills with nine, followed by Illinois with eight.

Why does it matter?

The 12 passed bills put Arkansas’ anti-ESG passage rate at about 71% (five bills have failed). Other states, including Missouri with 55 introduced bills and one enacted, have much lower passage rates.

The success rates indicate different levels of support for and different approaches to anti-ESG policies between states with Republican trifectas.

According to Arkansas Advocate:

The state has enacted seven anti-ESG measures, not including resolutions, since 2021. Connor Gibson, one of the report’s authors, said the ESG label is nebulous, but often takes aim at climate goals, social justice initiatives and culture war targets.

Much of the legislation that has moved through statehouses in the U.S. is based on model bills propagated by right-leaning think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, he said. The bills often prohibit state entities from giving contracts to or investing in businesses proponents believe discriminate against firearm manufacturers or fossil fuel companies, for example. …

The climate advisory group’s 2025 Statehouse Report highlighted the anti-ESG trends in legislatures across the country. Arkansas was one of the most effective states in passing such laws, said Gibson. While some states, like Missouri and Arizona, have proposed dozens of anti-ESG bills only to pass one or none, most of the legislation that’s gone before Arkansas lawmakers ended up becoming law.

Ohio legislature passes, North Carolina governor vetoes ESG-related bills

Two states took action on two ESG-related bills last week (since July 1).

An Ohio bill proposing to block the state board of deposit from directing the state treasurer to sell investments for the primary purpose of advancing ESG policy passed both chambers.

A North Carolina bill proposing to bar state and local governments from entering into contracts with private businesses that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives was vetoed.

According to Bloomberg:

At recent climate summits in London, representatives from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. were mingling with their European counterparts to discuss investment themes that have been vilified by the Trump administration. …

“We are an American bank, but especially being a highly regulated industry, we have to assess and evaluate what’s coming at us from all parts of the world,” Taylor Wright, head of operational sustainability at JPMorgan, said in an interview. “We see pressures on both sides.” …

Speaking at the City Week Net Zero Finance Innovation Summit, Cathy Shepherd, Citigroup’s global head of clean energy transition and the UK head of natural resources, said the current atmosphere in the US means clients concerned with transition finance are “really taking a pause on those investments.” That means that “money that’s sitting on the sidelines is starting to look elsewhere,” with Europe a “natural home” for those flows, she said.

AI energy needs complicate climate goals

What’s the story?

Google’s latest annual environmental report showed its overall emissions were up 51% since 2019 with rising AI and data center energy demands.

Why does it matter?

Google joins other big tech companies struggling to reach 2030 net zero emissions goals. Microsoft recently announced carbon capture investments as part of their effort to reach their end-of-decade environmental targets. The reports both highlight how AI energy demands are complicating corporate sustainability goals.

According to ESG Dive:

Google’s overall emissions are up 51% compared to a 2019 baseline, according to its latest annual environmental report. This jump in its overall carbon footprint comes despite the company’s progress in reducing its data center emissions and working towards its goal of powering operations on 24/7 clean energy last year.

The global tech and search engine conglomerate reduced its data center emissions 12% in 2024, despite rising energy demands due to artificial intelligence. Additionally, the company said it signed power agreements for 8 gigawatts of new clean energy generation and brought 2.5 GW of new clean energy online last year.

Google, which has a 2030 net-zero target date, called its climate targets “moonshots” and “ambition-based” in the latest report, both changes from its prior framing of the targets. The report documented an 11% decrease in year-over-year operational emissions — counting its scope 1 and 2 emissions — but when accompanied by a 22% increase in scope 3 emissions, the end result was an 11% increase in overall company emissions.",https://news.ballotpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cropped-BP-logo-Initials-color-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-08 17:15:07.276727

What happens to power systems during extreme heat? Are blackouts inevitable as weather patterns intensify? What changes, if any, can help?

Eduard Muljadi, the Danaher Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializes in power systems resilience and shared his insights.

How do heat waves impact electricity demand and grid infrastructure?

Eduard Muljadi: When heat waves hit, electricity demand spikes—mainly because air conditioning units run harder and longer, not just in homes but in businesses and data centers. That increase puts a strain on the grid, particularly during peak hours in the late afternoon and early evening. At the same time, the grid’s infrastructure, especially transmission lines and transformers, is stressed by the heat itself. These components can overheat, lose efficiency and become more prone to failure. On the generation side, thermal power plants may have to reduce output because water supplies used for cooling are either too warm or too limited. Even renewables like solar and wind can see drops in performance during extreme heat, which further tightens the supply-demand balance.

What kinds of failures or bottlenecks are most likely during high-demand heat events?

Eduard Muljadi: It’s a combination of mechanical stress and mismatched supply. Transformers and substations can overheat after hours of sustained load, which leads to insulation breakdown or failure. Overhead lines can sag when they get hot, and if they contact vegetation, that can cause fires or outages. Underground cables face similar thermal expansion problems. Generation also suffers — thermal plants rely on cool water, and when it’s too warm or unavailable, output drops. Solar panels become less efficient at high temperatures. If generation can’t meet demand, you start to see voltage and frequency instability, which can lead to brownouts or rolling blackouts. Add to that outdated infrastructure and operational challenges — like forecasting errors or lack of regional coordination — and the system becomes extremely vulnerable.

Are blackouts inevitable in a hotter future, or can we engineer our way around that scenario?

Eduard Muljadi: Blackouts aren’t inevitable in a hotter future, but avoiding them requires bold engineering, smart policy and sustained investment. Without action, rising temperatures and demand will strain the grid beyond its limits. Modernizing infrastructure is key. Upgrading transmission lines with heat-resistant materials, reinforcing substations and deploying real-time monitoring can prevent failures. Upgrading overhead lines to underground lines and enhancing cooling systems also reduces heat-related risks. Expanding grid flexibility is equally vital. Utility-scale batteries, smart grid technologies and distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and storage can balance supply and demand. Virtual power plants and long-distance transmission lines improve resilience. Managing demand helps, too. Programs that shift usage away from peak hours, energy-efficient buildings and updated building codes reduce stress on the system. Time-of-use pricing can guide consumer behavior. Finally, supportive policies like streamlined permitting, market reforms and regional coordination are essential. With the right tools and commitment, we can engineer a future where blackouts are the exception, not the rule.

Are some types of power sources more resistant to extreme heat than others?

Eduard Muljadi: Yes, and it’s important to understand those differences. Traditional thermal power plants — coal, gas and nuclear — are very sensitive to heat because they need water for cooling. During a heat wave or drought, their output often drops. Solar panels produce less power as they heat up, sometimes losing up to 15 percent of their efficiency. Wind is more mixed. Hot air is less dense, which reduces power generation, but wind patterns vary. Hydropower is fairly heat-resilient but depends on water availability. Batteries are sensitive to temperature, too, but most are designed with thermal controls. The key takeaway is that no one source is immune to heat, which is why having a diverse mix and strong backup systems is crucial.

Are aging transformers and substations the weak link, or are transmission constraints more pressing?

Eduard Muljadi: It’s not one or the other — it’s both, and they’re interconnected. Many of our transformers and substations are operating well past their intended lifespan. They can’t dissipate heat as effectively under high loads, which leads to breakdowns. At the same time, transmission lines face their own limits. When lines heat up, resistance increases, and they sag sometimes dangerously close to vegetation. To prevent fires or damage, operators reduce how much power those lines can carry. That creates bottlenecks, especially when you’re trying to move electricity from one region to another. So, you’ve got aging equipment on one end, and limited flexibility on the other. Repairing one without the other doesn’t solve the problem.

What kinds of grid upgrades or policies are urgently needed to prepare for future extreme heat?

Eduard Muljadi: We need to build a grid that’s smarter, stronger and more flexible. That means investing in large-scale battery storage, improving transmission lines so they can handle higher loads and modernizing substations with better cooling systems and monitoring tools. Smart grid technologies like real-time metering and automated fault detection can make the system more responsive. On the policy side, we need faster permitting for new infrastructure, incentives for utilities to modernize and stronger demand-response programs. Updating building codes to improve insulation and reduce cooling needs is also key. On a broader level, regional coordination and domestic manufacturing of critical components will help build resilience across the board. We need a rapid and coordinated transformation because the risks are growing faster than we’re currently responding.

What can residents do to prepare or even help reduce the threat of grid failure?

For county officials, farmland loss is a growing national concern, with implications that stretch beyond the farm gate. Since 1997, the U.S. has lost more than 75 million acres of farmland to development, a trend driven by a surge of competing land use demands, including housing development, energy, and commercial and industrial growth, most recently from data centers.

As our use and reliance on new technologies – and subsequently energy demand – has grown, largescale renewable energy development has emerged as a rapidly growing driver of farmland loss. While these technologies hold promise for local economic development, community resilience and producers looking to diversify their income, it also raises urgent questions about the future of agricultural communities.

With authority over zoning, permitting and land use in many states, county leaders are charged with balancing long-term community needs with individual property rights. These decisions unfold within a complex web of federal, state, local and tribal policies, making land use one of the most layered and contentious policy arenas in county government.

The recent shift in federal focus toward securing U.S. energy dominance through expanded domestic energy production has further underscored the urgency for counties to develop balanced, locally driven strategies for energy development. Counties believe that local, state and federal policy must guide energy development in ways that support economic opportunity and energy resilience while protecting agricultural viability.

As frontline decision-makers, county governments are facing the challenge of shaping how energy and agriculture can coexist. With thoughtful planning, comprehensive engagement and adaptive policy tools, county officials can ensure renewable energy development strengthens, rather than supplants, the agricultural foundation of America.

KEY FINDINGS

Rapid Growth in Renewable Energy: The U.S. renewable energy sector is expanding rapidly, driven by technological advancements, public investment and surging electricity demand, particularly from high-intensity industrial uses like data centers. Solar energy is projected to account for nearly three-quarters of renewable electricity generation growth by the end of 2025.

Farmland at Risk: The U.S. has lost nearly onetenth of the nation’s total farmland since 1997, equivalent to the farmland in Iowa and Indiana combined. Utility-scale renewable energy development, particularly solar, represents a growing contributor to farmland conversion.

Counties at a Crossroads: County officials face unique challenges in balancing renewable energy projects with farmland preservation, including competing land uses, rights of property owners, broader community economic benefits (including local tax revenues), environmental impacts and complex regulatory landscapes.

Solar energy is cheap, fast to deploy, and produces virtually no pollution during its operation.

As the nonpartisan energy think tank RMI has argued, the world is in the midst of a transition from the Information Age, which the United States led by dominating the development of new software and information technologies, to the Renewable Age, in which the development and deployment of electric and renewable energy technologies will drive the global economy.

This transition is dominated by insurgent clean technologies, such as solar, wind, electric vehicles, and batteries, whose prices are falling rapidly and whose growth is exponential.

Chinese manufacturers have invested heavily in those technologies. To help the U.S. economy better compete in the clean tech sector, Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in August 2022. That law included incentives to spur domestic manufacturing of these key clean energy technologies.

And it was working.

The U.S. experienced a clean energy manufacturing boom over the ensuing two years. But Republicans’ new budget reconciliation law, called the “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act,” guts those incentives and pulls the rug out from under nascent domestic clean energy industries.

On America’s birthday, President Donald Trump could not have given the Chinese economy a more generous gift.

Chinese manufacturers are dominating the EV market

The United States has the world’s second-largest car market, but EVs account for less than 10% of the country’s new auto sales. That can give U.S. residents the mistaken impression that EVs are unpopular.

In fact, more than one in five new passenger cars sold around the world in 2024 were electric. BloombergNEF, a market research firm, forecasts that this share will rise to about one in four new cars this year. That could rise to four out of every 10 by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. In other words, the global auto market is increasingly electric.

China has the largest domestic auto market in the world, and half the new vehicles sold in the country today are EVs. And Chinese automakers are dominating the global EV market, offering a wide array of affordable and advanced cars. The electric car giant BYD’s cheapest model, the Seagull, is priced at less than $10,000, dramatically undercutting U.S.-based companies like Tesla.

Ford CEO Jim Farley recently described Chinese EVs as “far superior to what I see in the West.” He added that if his company loses the EV market to Chinese automakers, “We do not have a future Ford.”

Former President Joe Biden placed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs to protect the U.S. domestic industry. And U.S. demand for EVs was expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as the result of federal tax credits for American-made electric cars and U.S. tailpipe pollution regulations.

But Republicans’ new budget law will terminate the former on September 30, and the Trump administration has gutted the latter.

As a result, energy systems modelers at Princeton and BloombergNEF project that only about half as many U.S. residents will buy EVs over the next five years as previously expected. By 2030, only about 27% of new car sales in the U.S. are now expected to be electric, compared to 80% in China.

Chinese firms are winning the solar market, too

The story is similar for solar panels. Solar energy is cheap, fast to deploy, and produces virtually no pollution during its operation. It accounted for about 70% of all new global power generation capacity added in 2024, including nearly 60% in the United States.

Chinese firms control over 80% of the global solar panel manufacturing supply chain, according to the International Energy Agency.

The IRA aimed to bolster the U.S. solar manufacturing industry, in part through clean electricity tax credits. But as a result of the Republican budget law’s rapid phaseout of those incentives, the U.S. will deploy about 40% less clean energy over the next decade, according to modeling by experts at Princeton. Companies like U.S. solar manufacturer Talon PV have already begun pausing or canceling U.S. projects in anticipation of the clean energy tax credit repeals, as well as other uncertainties like Trump’s unpredictable tariffs.

When the IRA became law, there was a surge in planned battery, EV, and solar manufacturing investments, according to a project to track clean energy manufacturing announcements by a team at Wellesley College. That was followed by a steep decline since last November’s elections and associated threats to clean energy incentives.

Energy Innovation, a Yale Climate Connections content-sharing partner, anticipates that the repealed clean energy tax credits will cost 760,000 jobs by 2030 and reduce the country’s gross domestic product by nearly a trillion dollars.

The budget reconciliation law gives the Chinese economy other advantages

The big budget law will likely cause a tremendous number of other negative impacts. Because clean energy deployment will slow down at a time when power demand is rising rapidly and natural gas turbines are facing years of delivery backlogs, experts warn it will create energy scarcity. American companies will likely be left scrambling to find enough supply to meet rising power demand, which will lead to higher electricity bills and put U.S. artificial intelligence developers at a disadvantage in their high-stakes race against their Chinese competitors.

Increasing the country’s reliance on fossil fuels will also result in more air pollution and sicker U.S. residents, coinciding with at least 17 million people losing their health coverage and more than 300 hospitals facing the risk of closure, the result of other provisions in the GOP’s new law.

The Senate made the bill 25% less damaging to the climate

As harmful as the final law is, it was very nearly considerably worse for the climate. The version initially passed by the House would have effectively immediately gutted the clean electricity tax credits. It was so damaging that 13 House Republicans pleaded with their Senate colleagues to fix the bill they had all just voted for.

The Senate Finance Committee did indeed make some improvements, softening the requirements for clean electricity to qualify for the tax credits and significantly extending their timeline for sources other than solar and wind.

Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), and John Curtis (Utah) reportedly negotiated a last-minute amendment to the bill that added a one-year runway for new solar and wind projects to begin construction and still qualify for the full clean electricity tax credits.

The Princeton modelers estimated that compared to the status quo, the House version of the bill would have added about 2.7 billion tons of climate pollution to the atmosphere while increasing average U.S. household energy bills by more than $2,000 over the coming decade. The final bill passed by the Senate and signed into law by Trump is projected to instead add 2.1 billion tons of climate pollution and cost U.S. households a bit under $1,700 in higher energy bills over the next decade.

That’s about 25% less costly than the House version – both to pocketbooks and to the climate.

But it’s considerably worse than the status quo of Biden-era policies and regulations, in which the accelerated deployment of cheap solar and wind energy was expected to reduce household energy bills by about $600 over the next decade.

And on its new course, the U.S. will exceed its 2030 Paris commitment by 7 billion tons of climate pollution, according to an analysis by Carbon Brief.

Given the slimmest of margins by which the bill passed the Senate, any Republican senator could have sent the bill back to the drawing board by simply voting no. Sen. Murkowski instead chose to cast the deciding vote after extracting a variety of concessions for her state and clean energy incentives, before pleading with the House to further fix the bill whose passage she had ensured.

A bill everyone dislikes, except Chinese manufacturers

Because of the sprawling nature of the big budget law, it has something for just about everyone to dislike. And indeed, polls have consistently found that Americans oppose the bill by a nearly two-to-one margin.

Whether it be higher energy costs, lost domestic manufacturing, jobs, and economic growth, the ballooning of the national debt, energy scarcity, drastic cuts to the social safety net, exacerbated income inequality, or an extra 2 billion tons of climate pollution, there may only be one group that loves the big budget bill. As Energy Innovation’s Senior Director of Modeling and Analysis Robbie Orvis put it:

“To sum it up, this bill is a GIFT to China, which must be smiling right now watching what’s happening. We are gifting them the industries of the future, making the U.S. an eminently harder place to invest in, and decreasing our energy security.”",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/725-big-beautiful-bill-climate-change-china-GettyImages-2223602541.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:14.424792

Plastic waste is a global problem that has challenged society for nearly 75 years.
NETL’s solution diverts plastics from waste streams into the manufacturing supply chain where the material can be used more beneficially and economically.
The newly funded process joins the Lab’s other patent-pending technology to upcycle plastic waste and use it as a manufacturing feedstock for making a range of high-value, solid-carbon materials, including supercapacitors.
“By producing solid carbon materials, such as graphite, from waste plastic, we can sequester the waste in a high-quality product with a longer service life than the single-use plastics it is produced from.","NETL has received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Critical Materials Innovation Hub to expand research that transforms single-use water bottles, shopping bags and other waste plastic into a valuable, unconventional feedstock for manufacturing high-quality graphite.

“Graphite is a critical mineral needed by U.S. manufacturers to produce lithium-ion battery anodes for vehicles, military drones, backup power systems and more,” said NETL researcher Yuan Gao. “Working with partners through the DOE Critical Materials Innovation Hub will help establish a strong domestic supply chain of high-quality graphite while transforming polyethylene (PE) waste into a valuable resource.”

NETL’s unique process provides a simple method to turn PE into graphite that is comparable or higher quality than commercially available synthetic graphite.

The process diverts single-use plastics and other PE waste from the world’s oceans and landfills into the manufacturing sector, where it can be utilized for beneficial, revenue-generating purposes and help generate a strong domestic supply of a critical mineral needed to support U.S. national and economic security.

Funds awarded through the DOE Critical Materials Innovation Hub will enable NETL’s Carbon Materials Manufacturing team to continue a partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Ames National Laboratory and Ingevity, a global corporation headquartered in North Charleston, South Carolina.

The partnership was launched in January 2024 to convert PE waste and lignin (biomass generated by paper manufacturing and other plant-based industries) into pure and highly crystalline graphite suitable for energy-related applications, including battery anodes for fast-charging application in electric vehicles.

The goal of the upcoming work is to convert biomass-derived carbon and plastic waste-derived carbon char into graphite using a simplified chemical process that employs machine learning to screen process variables and determine the optimal value to use for each.

Plastic waste is a global problem that has challenged society for nearly 75 years. More than 7.8 billion tons of plastic have been produced since the 1950s, which is approximately one ton of plastic for every person alive. While some recycling methods exist, they are generally limited to waste streams that are relatively uncontaminated with food, dyes and additives.

Additionally, traditional recycling causes the deterioration of polymer properties. This deterioration means that plastics can only be recycled a few times before their technical and economic value is lost. Due, in part, to these limitations, only 6-7% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled.

NETL’s solution diverts plastics from waste streams into the manufacturing supply chain where the material can be used more beneficially and economically. The newly funded process joins the Lab’s other patent-pending technology to upcycle plastic waste and use it as a manufacturing feedstock for making a range of high-value, solid-carbon materials, including supercapacitors.

“By producing solid carbon materials, such as graphite, from waste plastic, we can sequester the waste in a high-quality product with a longer service life than the single-use plastics it is produced from. In the case of graphite used in batteries, the product can be recovered and reused at the end of device life, which extends the graphite service life even further,” said Christopher Matranga, a senior NETL researcher on the project.

The Critical Materials Innovation Hub was established in 2013 and is led by Ames National Laboratory as a sustained, multidisciplinary effort to develop solutions across the materials life cycle as well as reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions and price fluctuations associated with these valuable resources.

The OBBBA makes tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, in some cases with certain adjustments. The OBBBA also includes new tax provisions for individuals and businesses, and rolls back certain tax incentives adopted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Below we summarize key business and individual tax provisions included in the OBBBA. Please note: This summary is based on a preliminary review of the bill, a lengthy and complex piece of legislation. This information will be updated as we continue to review the legislation and as new details emerge.

SALT Cap Temporarily Increased

The deduction cap for state and local taxes is increased to $40,000 for 2025 for taxpayers making less than $500,000 and will increase by 1% for each of the years 2026 through 2029 before reverting back to $10,000 in 2030. For taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $500,000, the $40,000 cap is phased downward (but not below $10,000) for years 2025 through 2029. No specific provisions regarding the application of pass-through entity tax were included in the bill.

New Deductions for Tip Income and Overtime Pay for Tax Years 2025 through 2028

The OBBBA provides new temporary deductions for tips and overtime pay. The new deduction for tip income is available to individuals regardless of whether or not they itemize their deductions, and applies to tips received from customers for services in industries where tips are customary. The deduction is limited to $25,000, with a phase-out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). Those in a “specified service trade or business” are excluded — for example, those in the fields of health, law, accounting, actuarial services, performing arts, consulting, athletics, banking, financial and brokerage services, and farming cannot take advantage of the deduction.

Additionally, the FICA tip credit for employers is now expanded to include those in the beauty services and food and beverage industries.

The new deduction for overtime pay is also available to individuals regardless of whether or not they itemize their deductions. The deduction is limited to $12,500 of qualified overtime income ($25,000 for joint filers), with a phase-out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).

Expansion of Business Expensing

The OBBBA permanently restores 100% bonus depreciation for certain qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025 (includes depreciable property with a recovery period of 20 years or less and qualified improvement property). The bill permanently restores the immediate expensing of domestic research or experimental expenditures for amounts paid or incurred beginning January 1, 2025, with an election to amortize certain expenditures over not less than 60 months. The Section 179 annual expense limit is increased to $2.5M, reduced by expenditures for §179 property that exceed $4M.

Other Major Highlights: What Tax Provisions are Included?

Makes permanent current individual income tax rates and brackets (with a top income tax rate of 37%), with inflation adjustments for the 10%, 12% and 22% brackets.

The standard deduction is permanently increased — it will be $15,750 for single taxpayers ($31,500 for joint filers) beginning in 2025.

Miscellaneous itemized deductions are now permanently eliminated (i.e., unreimbursed employee expenses, tax preparation fees, etc.), with a new exception for certain unreimbursed educator expenses.

Personal exemptions are permanently eliminated. Seniors (ages 65 and older) are allowed a deduction of $6,000 for years 2025 through 2028, to be phased out if modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers).

Certain mortgage insurance premiums will now qualify as acquisition indebtedness for purposes of the mortgage interest deduction.

The casualty loss deduction is permanently limited, with a new exception for state-declared disasters.

The calculation for limitation of the business interest deduction is now permanent.

The 199A business income deduction is permanently extended, now with increased phase-in for income limits beginning in 2026, and a $400 (adjusted for inflation) minimum deduction for those taxpayers with a minimum of $1,000 of qualifying income from certain trades or businesses. The deduction limit phase-in range for specified service trades or businesses and other taxpayers subject to the wage and investment limitation is expanded to $150,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for single filers.

Noncorporate taxpayer’s limitation on excess business losses is permanently extended, with the income threshold for determining an excess business loss now adjusted for inflation.

Provides for a new temporary car loan interest deduction up to $10,000 for vehicles the final assembly of which occurs in the United States.

Dependent care assistant program flex-spending account limits are increased to $7,500.

The child tax credit is increased to $2,200, with annual adjustments for inflation.

Alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption is increased permanently to $1,000,000 for joint filers ($500,000 for single filers), indexed for inflation, and adjusts the phaseout exemption amount from 25% to 50% after 2025.

Beginning in 2026, taxpayers who do not itemize deductions are allowed a charitable contribution deduction of up to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint filers). For taxpayers who itemize deductions, charitable deductions are allowed in excess of 0.5% of the taxpayer’s contribution base (adjusted gross income, without taking into account any charitable gifts).

Revises the §1202 small business stock exclusion to allow a partial exclusion of 50% of gain from the sale of qualified small business stock issued after the date of enactment that is held for at least three years; 75% exclusion if held for at least four years; and a 100% exclusion if held for at least five years. The gross asset limitation to qualify is increased to $75M, and the per-taxpayer gain exclusion cap is increased to $15M.

Permanently extends Opportunity Zone tax benefits. Qualified Opportunity Zones will now be redesignated every 10 years beginning in 2026. Deferred gain on investments made after January 1, 2027, will be recognized on the earlier of five years or disposition of the investment. A 10% basis increase is allowed if held for five years. No tax is imposed on investment gains if the qualified investment is held for at least 10 years and up to 30 years.

Estate tax exemptions are increased to $15 million ($30 million for joint filers).

International tax updates include changes to rules applicable to controlled foreign corporations, the foreign tax credit and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) regime, and certain changes in rates and deduction percentages, beginning in 2026.

President Donald Trump signed wide-ranging tax legislation, P.L. 119-21 (the Legislation) on July 4, 2025.

The Legislation includes net tax cuts of $4.5 trillion and spending cuts of $1.2 trillion, for a cost compared with current law of approximately $3.3 trillion over the 10-year budget window.

The Legislation will affect nearly every sector of the economy and every type of taxpayer, including individuals, corporations, pass-through entities and tax-exempt organizations.

The race to remake portions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and to prevent expiration of certain Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions reached completion with Legislation signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025. The Legislation combines spending and policy priorities from 11 congressional committees and will reshape federal policy across nearly every sector of the U.S. economy.

With respect to taxes, notable provisions include the following: The Legislation makes permanent most of the expiring provisions of the TCJA; makes permanent changes to U.S. corporate international tax provisions; makes permanent the allowance for domestic research and development (R&D) expensing and bonus depreciation; allows immediate expensing for the cost of certain manufacturing facilities; phases out early or repeals certain Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) renewable energy credits; modifies the excess business loss calculation; permanently renews and expands Qualified Opportunity Zones, the New Markets Tax Credits and low-income housing credits; increases the investment credit for semiconductor manufacturers for certain new facilities; restores Section 958(b)(4) prospectively and in a modified manner; allows oil and gas companies to exempt intangible drilling and development costs when calculating their corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); increases the maximum of a real estate investment trust’s (REIT’s) assets that may be held through taxable subsidiary corporations; treats spaceports like airports for purposes of the exempt-facility bond rules; increases taxes on net investment income of certain private college and university endowments; makes permanent (with certain limited enhancements) the 37 percent individual top tax rate; increases and makes permanent the child tax credit; increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for certain taxpayers through 2029; increases and makes permanent the standard deduction and Section 199A; adds on a temporary basis various provisions promised by President Trump on the campaign trail, including eliminating taxes on certain tips and overtime, allowing for the deduction of auto loan interest for certain new cars, and providing a bonus standard deduction for seniors to help offset the cost of taxation of certain Social Security income; establishes Trump investment accounts for children; permanently increases the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million; caps the value of itemized deductions at 35 percent and places a floor on itemized deductions of charitable contributions; adds a 1 percent floor on the corporate deduction of charitable contributions and a one percent remittance tax on certain transferors who send money abroad and tightens restrictions regarding the employee retention credit.

The Legislation did not make any changes to carried interest or the corporate or capital gains tax rates, did not reduce the corporate rate for U.S. manufacturing (but does allow full immediate expensing of certain manufacturing facilities), does not repeal the stock buyback tax or the corporate AMT, and contains no limitation on corporate deductions of state or local taxes. Unlike certain earlier drafts, the Legislation dropped the proposed Section 899 revenge tax, dropped the proposed attack on passthrough entity SALT deduction work-arounds, dropped the proposed 41 percent punitive tax on litigation funding, dropped the proposed excise tax on wind and solar projects that received certain assistance from foreign entities of concern (FEOC), dropped the proposed moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence, dropped proposals relating to sales of public lands, and dropped a proposed amendment to Section 7213 to increase criminal penalties in cases of unauthorized disclosure of certain private tax return information. The Legislation did not make the more taxpayer-friendly changes to Section 163(j) that were originally proposed by the House; Public Law 86-272 modernization protections relating to taxation by states also were not included in the Legislation. There is likely to be one or more additional reconciliation bills during late 2025 and 2026 and therefore additional opportunities for enactment of additional provisions, as well as changes and improvements to the Legislation. And the importance of engaging with the IRS and Treasury as they develop guidance to implement some of the more complex provisions cannot be overstated.

Bonus Depreciation

The Legislation permanently extends and modifies Section 168 first-year (bonus) depreciation, generally allowing 100 percent depreciation in the first year for certain property acquired and placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025. The Legislation also makes permanent the percentage of completion method for allocation of bonus depreciation to long-term contracts.

Immediate Expensing for Qualified Production Property

To encourage domestic manufacturing and production, the Legislation contains a special provision for qualified production property that allows for the immediate expensing of 100 percent of the adjusted basis of the qualified production property, including 39-year factory (manufacturing) property.

Qualified production property means the portion of any nonresidential real property (1) used as an integral part of a qualified production activity; (2) placed in service in the U.S.; and (3) whose original use begins with the taxpayer. The construction of the property must begin after Jan. 19, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2029. The property must be placed in service after the date of enactment and before Jan. 1, 2031. Qualifying production activities include manufacturing, production or refining of tangible personal property and agricultural or chemical production.

Increased Dollar Limitations for Expensing of Certain Depreciable Business Assets

The Legislation allows for immediate expensing under Section 179 of the cost of qualifying property up to $2.5 million, with a phaseout threshold that begins to reduce the deductible amount when costs exceed $4 million for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2024. Under current law, up to $1 million may be expensed and the phaseout threshold amount is $2.5 million.

In general, qualifying property is defined as depreciable tangible personal property, off-the-shelf computer software and qualified real property that is purchased for use in the active conduct of a trade or business.

Research and Development

Since 2022, taxpayers have been required to capitalize and amortize U.S.-based research or experimental expenditures ratably over a five-year period and non-U.S.-based research or experimental expenditures ratably over a 15-year period. These include costs to develop or improve a product, including software. Examples of costs are the salaries of the persons engaged in the research or experimentation efforts, overhead incurred to operate and maintain the facility, and materials and supplies that are consumed in the course of the research or experimental activities. The requirement to capitalize and amortize these costs has been a source of contention since 2022.

The Legislation permanently suspends the capitalization of domestic research or experimental expenditures for amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. However, a taxpayer may elect to capitalize and amortize the expenditures by filing an election with its tax return. This is an important election for some taxpayers, who benefit more from foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) -- which permanently lowers their tax rate -- when they capitalize (a mere timing issue) R&D expenditures. Foreign research or experimental expenditures still must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period.

Business Interest Deductibility

Under the TCJA, Section 163(j) generally limited the amount of business interest that a taxpayer may deduct (1) business interest income, (2) to 30 percent of its “adjusted taxable income” (ATI) and (3) certain interest associated with vehicle inventory financing. The Legislation makes limited incremental adjustments to Section 163(j) by explicitly requiring the provision’s coordination with interest capitalization rules and by statutorily mandating that ATI will be computed without considering amounts related to offshore operations (e.g., subpart F or global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions). The changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

The Legislation marks a departure from the more taxpayer-friendly changes to Section 163(j) that were originally proposed by the House. In the House’s original text, the determination of ATI – which under the TCJA was essentially defined as EBITDA until calendar year 2023, and EBIT thereafter – would have brought back the “DA” by again equating ATI with EBITDA for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. The original House text also would have extended vehicle inventory financing benefits to recreational vehicle dealers for calendar years 2025 and beyond.

FDII (Renamed FDDEI)

The most substantive changes to FDII include (1) permanently modifying the FDII deduction rate to 33.34 percent (i.e., eliminating a scheduled reduction to a 21.875 percent deduction rate beginning in calendar year 2026), thereby making the effective rate of FDII approximately 14 percent, (2) eliminating the hurdle related to qualified business asset investment (QBAI) that taxpayers were required to overcome in order to enjoy FDII benefits, and (3) modifying the relevant computational rules so that interest and research expenditures are no longer allocated against FDII-qualified income. While the final bill modestly increases the overall rate applicable to FDII relative to the original House version, its targeting of certain key TCJA-related structural deficiencies that have plagued the FDII regime’s operation is very taxpayer friendly and is certain to further enhance the attractiveness of the regime. These FDII changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

The Legislation also makes changes to FDII that seeks to limit a taxpayer’s ability to benefit from the regime when offshoring intellectual property or other valuable assets. Historically, gains and royalties arising from outbound disposals of intellectual property to foreign affiliates (e.g., due to a sale or Section 367(d) contributions) could qualify for favorable FDII rates; however, this result arguably ran counter to FDII objectives aimed at encouraging U.S. multinationals to onshore intellectual property following the enactment of the TCJA. Accordingly, the Legislation eliminates the ability to claim FDII benefits for any disposals of intellectual property or other valuable assets to foreign affiliates, with effect for dispositions (including deemed dispositions) occurring after June 16, 2025. The Legislation does not include language contained in the earlier Senate version that would have made passive income – such as income of a type similar to foreign personal holding company income (for instance, certain royalties paid by a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) for local exploitation) – ineligible for FDII benefits. Such a limitation arguably would have been contrary to the objectives of FDII (e.g., to encourage holding intellectual property in the U.S.) and would have diminished the benefits of the FDII regime.

Finally, the Legislation changes the name of FDII to “Foreign-Derived Deduction-Eligible Income.”

The Legislation repeals the scheduled increase in the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which was scheduled to increase from 10 percent to 12.5 percent for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, and instead permanently adopts a slightly higher 10.5 percent rate that applies for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. The Legislation does not include “super” BEAT provisions – which would have increased the rate to 14 percent and made the provision applicable to more taxpayers – that were included in the Senate’s original legislative draft.

GILTI (Renamed Net CFC Tested Income)

The Legislation seeks to improve the operation of GILTI by making several modifications to the regime, including by addressing certain TCJA-related structural deficiencies that have plagued GILTI since its origin and by eliminating certain computational elements that might be perceived as incentivizing offshore (rather than onshore) manufacturing. The Legislation’s most substantive changes to GILTI include (1) permanently modifying the GILTI deduction rate to 40 percent (i.e., eliminating a scheduled reduction to a 37.5 percent deduction rate beginning in calendar year 2026), thereby making GILTI’s effective rate 12.6 percent (assuming GILTI earnings are not subject to foreign tax), (2) permanently reducing the GILTI haircut on deemed paid foreign taxes from 20 percent to 10 percent, with the result that GILTI-related earnings that bear a 14 percent effective rate of foreign tax should not be subject to residual federal income taxation, (3) eliminating the QBAI-related tax-free return that taxpayers had enjoyed following the TCJA, and (4) modifying the relevant foreign tax credit limitation provisions so that various expenses (particularly those associated with interest and research expenditures) are allocated and apportioned to U.S. source income rather than to income otherwise belonging to the GILTI basket. As with FDII, the Legislation operates to modestly increase the overall rate applicable to GILTI relative to the original House version; however, its targeting of various statutory deficiencies that have plagued the intended operation of GILTI generally is taxpayer friendly. While the elimination of the QBAI-related tax-free return may impact certain U.S. multinationals (e.g., energy companies where offshore CAPEX costs can be significant), many taxpayers may find the elimination of the QBAI benefit a relatively modest price to pay for the more significant improvements to the GILTI regime. These GILTI-related changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Implications Regarding Pillar 1 and Pillar 2

The Legislation and related tariff actions make clear, as expected, that the U.S. Congress and the Trump administration believe Pillar 1 is dead and have no intention of aligning U.S. tax laws with Pillar 2. Treasury officials have stated that the U.S. tax system is robust enough that other countries should refrain from applying the 15 percent global minimum tax (Pillar 2) to any income that the U.S. taxes. To make these points explicit, earlier versions of the legislative text from both the House and the Senate included a new Code Section 899, which was aimed at discouraging foreign countries from enacting and applying discriminatory, extraterritorial or similar taxes that disproportionately had a direct or indirect impact on U.S. persons. This new statutory provision specifically would have targeted foreign countries that enact undertaxed profits rules (UTPRs), digital services taxes (DSTs), diverted profits taxes and similar measures. When applicable, the provision would generally modify the regular U.S. tax rates applicable to the governments of, and individuals and companies tax resident in, such “discriminatory foreign countries” by incrementally increasing the rate by 5 percentage points each year (but capping the overall increase at 15 or 20 percentage points). The provision garnered significant attention, and despite its similarity to a UTPR (i.e., an in terrorem tax rule designed to encourage other countries to adjust their local tax laws to avoid its application), many Europe-based stakeholders complained that new Section 899 would significantly impact historic investments in the U.S. and would possibly impede future direct investment.

In late June 2025, after holding a series of negotiations with other countries, the U.S. Treasury Secretary made a request that the Senate remove Section 899 from the bill due to a pending G-7 agreement to permit side-by-side co-existence of Pillar 2 and the U.S. tax system (including GILTI, as currently configured, without country-by-country application). On June 28, 2025, representatives of the G-7 countries issued a statement confirming their commitment to this side-by-side agreement, and while precise details are not yet fully known the stated objective is that U.S. multinationals will not be subject to Pillar 2’s UTPRs or “income inclusion rules” in respect of U.S. and foreign source earnings. Given this agreement, the final bill does not include Section 899. While the side-by-side agreement must still be formalized and adopted by the OECD-led Inclusive Framework, the commitment made by the G-7 countries and the possibility for a second reconciliation bill in late 2025 should ensure that the agreement is made durable.

In late June 2025, Canada also agreed to rescind its DST in order to continue tariff negotiations with the U.S. After many delayed effective dates, Canada’s DST was first due on June 30, 2025, covering revenues earned since January 1, 2022. Taxpayers who filed and made payments with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) before the June 30th deadline and before Canada’s agreement to rescind the DST should receive refunds once Canada’s Parliament returns from its summer break in mid-September and formally repeals the DST. CRA has stated that it lacks legal authority to refund DST payments absent legislation.

Other International Tax Changes

The Legislation includes a number of other changes to U.S. international tax rules that were not in the original House text. The most notable international tax changes in the final bill include:

More Favorable U.S.-Production Sourcing Rules

The Legislation seeks to enhance the sourcing rules for U.S. produced inventory, by permitting up to 50 percent of the income associated therewith to be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit purposes notwithstanding the final sentence of Section 863(b) (which sources entirely based on location of production).

Reinstatement of Section 958(b)(4) and Enactment of New Section 951B

The Legislation reinstates Section 958(b)(4), which was repealed by the TCJA, on a prospective-only basis for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, and with modifications to the manner it will apply going forward. Before the TCJA, that section functioned to block downward attributions of stock ownership in the context of determining which corporations were CFCs. The Legislation enacts new Section 951B to implement the new and targeted approach, again prospectively only for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. There were various winners and losers associated with the TCJA’s repeal of Section 958(b)(4) and Congress previously determined on numerous occasions not to reinstate Section 958(b)(4).

Elimination of the Section 898 One-Month Deferral Election

The Legislation eliminates the possibility of electing a one-month deferral for the required U.S. tax year of U.S.-owned foreign corporations (generally CFCs). The provision arguably seeks to eliminate on a going-forward basis tax year-end change planning that was prevalent following the adoption of the TCJA. It is effective for tax years of specified foreign corporations beginning after Nov. 30, 2025.

Permanent CFC “Look-Through” Under Section 954(c)(6)

The Legislation makes permanent the subpart F “look-through” rule for payments from related CFCs.

Modification of the Subpart F -- GILTI “Pro Rata” Rules

The Legislation makes significant changes to the subpart F and GILTI “pro rata” rules under Sections 951(a) and 951A. Most significantly, the revised rules no longer (1) trigger inclusions solely for U.S. shareholders that own a CFC on the last day of the CFC year, or (2) allow distributions to operate to reduce or eliminate taxable income. The changes arguably target Section 951(a)(2)(B) and similar planning techniques that were popular following the adoption of the TCJA, and because the changes are anti-abuse in nature there are transition rules relating to actual and deemed dividends that may have an immediate impact on current year tax results.

Foreign Tax Credit Limitations for Previously Taxed Earnings and Profits (PTEP) Distributions

The Legislation makes it clear that foreign taxes otherwise associated with the GILTI haircut (e.g., the 10 percent haircut applied to foreign taxes for deemed paid tax purposes) cannot be claimed on a subsequent distribution of PTEP. The changes arguably target foreign tax credit planning that may have been possible due to revisions to Section 960 made in connection with the enactment of the TCJA. Because the changes are anti-abuse in nature, they are effective for amounts distributed after June 28, 2025.

Except as otherwise noted above, these changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Modifications to Renewable Energy Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act

The Legislation significantly modifies and in some instances repeals various renewable energy credits and provisions that were enacted as part of the IRA. These changes generated enormous amounts of revenue that were integral to offsetting the Legislation’s deficit generating provisions. The modifications include the adoption of “prohibited foreign entity” rules that prevent certain entities that either are owned or have commercial ties with persons from covered nations (i.e., China, North Korea, Russia and Iran) from claiming renewable energy credits contained in the IRA. The modifications also include the adoption of “material assistance” rules that prevent eligibility for certain credits where a prohibited foreign entity materially assisted with manufacturing or construction. What follows is a summary of the most significant changes and portions of an executive Order issued by President Trump on July 7th.

Prohibited Foreign Entities and Material Assistance

The prohibited foreign entity rules are the culmination of prior legislative attempts to restrict and prevent certain foreign owned or controlled entities from benefiting from U.S. federal income tax credits. In many respects, however, the enacted rules go beyond prior attempts by targeting not just certain foreign-owned entities but also commercial transactions and ties with certain foreign-owned companies. The rules broadly apply to renewable energy credits in three situations.

The first situation relates to “specified foreign entities,” which is generally defined as an entity that is related to or controlled (through stock or equity) by the government, companies, or individuals of covered nations (as defined above).

The second situation is for entities that are “foreign-influenced entities,” which targets ownership (similar to the definition of a specified foreign entity) and commercial transactions and relationships with a prohibited foreign entity. The definition generally causes an entity to be considered a foreign-influenced entity (and in turn a prohibited foreign entity) if a separate prohibited foreign entity has the ability to direct or decide matters affecting management or operations of the entity. Whether an entity is a foreign-influenced entity is subjective and requires an analysis of the entity’s capital structure (debt and equity), contracts for materials or manufactured goods, and other arrangements such as licensing agreements. The entity’s contracts and other arrangements must be analyzed to determine whether a prohibited foreign entity has the ability to exercise “effective control” over aspects of the entity’s management or certain business affairs.

The final situation involves whether an entity receives “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity. If an entity does receive “material assistance,” either products it makes will not qualify as eligible components under Section 45X or the facility that is being constructed will not qualify as a qualified facility for purposes of production and investment tax credits.

The Legislation adopted material assistance rules that analyze cost ratio thresholds for manufactured products and facilities. The cost ratio is calculated based on the total direct material costs paid or incurred by the manufacturer of an eligible component or developer of a facility to a prohibited foreign entity over the total amount of direct costs paid or incurred. If the ratio is above a statutorily defined threshold, the manufactured product or the facility are ineligible for certain renewable energy credits. The final legislation defines the relevant cost ratios and states that taxpayers may in the interim rely on existing IRS guidance relating to domestic content until additional guidance is issued.

The prohibited foreign entity rules take effect in the taxable year beginning after the enactment of the Legislation. The material assistance rules apply to facilities the construction of which begins after Dec. 31, 2025 and to eligible components produced in the taxable year beginning after the date of enactment.

Clean Fuel Production Credit – Section 45Z

The clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z would be modified by the Legislation to require that feedstocks be produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. Previously, there were no sourcing requirements with respect to feedstocks, and clean fuel producers were therefore able to import feedstocks such as sugar cane from abroad. The Legislation also contains amendments to the greenhouse gas emissions requirements for land use changes and emissions rates for animal manure used as a feedstock. Finally, the Legislation extends the clean fuel production credit to Dec. 31, 2029, which aligns it with the modified phaseout and expiration dates made to other credits.

Clean Electricity Production Credit and Investment Tax Credit – Sections 45Y and 48E

The Legislation terminates the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment tax credit for all wind and solar energy property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027. However, in a last minute change to the Legislation, the termination provision was amended to be effective for property the construction of which begins one-year after the enactment of the Legislation. Thus, projects that begin construction within the next year are not subject to the Dec. 31, 2027 placed-in service restriction. This provision generated enormous controversy when the Senate returned the Legislation to the House, and it remains to be seen how it will be implemented by Treasury and the IRS, including in light of the Executive Order discussed immediately below.

As noted above, the prohibited foreign entity and material assistance rules apply to all types of facilities eligible for clean electricity production and investment tax credits (i.e., biogas, energy storage, geothermal, etc.).

July 7th Executive Order Regarding “Beginning of Construction” and “FEOC”

President Trump issued an executive Order on July 7th stating, in Section 3 in relevant part:

“(a) Within 45 days following enactment…, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built,” and

“(b) Within 45 days following enactment…, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions….”

Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit – Section 45X

The Legislation contains minor revisions to Section 45X, including amendments to the definition of “battery module,” revisions to the rules for integrated components and the ability to “stack” Section 45X tax credits, and adding phaseouts to Section 45X tax credits for the production of critical minerals starting in 2031. As noted above, the prohibited foreign entity rules also apply to prohibit any manufacturer that meets the definition of a prohibited foreign entity from claiming a Section 45X credit. The material assistance rules also apply to prohibit any property manufactured with the material assistance of a prohibited foreign entity from qualifying as an eligible component for purposes of Section 45X.

Other IRA Credits

The Legislation repealed the Section 25E credits for previously owned clean vehicles, the Section 30D clean vehicle credit, the Section 45W commercial clean vehicle credit, the Section 30C alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, the Section 25C energy efficient home improvement credit, the Section 25D residential clean energy credit, and the Section 45L new energy efficient home credit. The repeals have various effective dates of either Sept. 30, 2025 (25E credits, 30D credits, and 45W credits), Dec. 31, 2025 (25C credits and 25D credits), or June 30, 2026 (30C credits and 45L credits). The Legislation also moved the termination date for Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits from Jan. 1, 2033 to Jan. 1, 2028.

Credits for Semiconductor Manufacturers

The Legislation increases the advanced manufacturing tax credit, including for semiconductor manufacturers, from 25 percent to 35 percent for certain new facilities.

SALT Cap and Retreat from Attack on Most SALT Cap Work-Arounds

Prior to the changes made by the TCJA, individuals were permitted generally to take a deduction against their federal gross income for the full amount of state, local and foreign income taxes paid. Under the TCJA, an individual’s itemized deductions for state, local and foreign income taxes were capped at $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately), beginning in 2018. This so-called “SALT Cap” was scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025. During the years post the TCJA, 36 states enacted work arounds for individuals who are partners in partnerships or shareholders in S corporations. While each state’s law is different, the general approach provides a pass-through entity tax (PTET) mechanism that allowed a pass-through entity to elect to pay an entity-level state income tax and pass the resulting tax benefit along to its partners and/or shareholders. The IRS approved of the PTET SALT Cap work-around when it issued Notice 2020-75, 2020-49 I.R.B. 1453, which provided that the IRS intended to issue regulations clarifying that state income taxes paid by a pass-through entity would be allowed as a deduction by the entity. No regulations were ever issued.

The Legislation raises the SALT Cap to $40,000 for tax years beginning in 2025 and does not limit or otherwise explicitly affect the deduction for partners or shareholders of pass-through entities who avail themselves of the PTET deduction. For tax year 2026, the SALT Cap will increase to $40,400 and for years after 2026 and before 2030, the SALT Cap will be 101% of the dollar amount for the taxable year in the preceding calendar year. For years after 2029, the SALT Cap will revert to $10,000.

The SALT Cap is subject to a phase down by 30 percent of a taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000 (or $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing separately) for tax year 2025. For taxable year 2026, the phase down begins at $505,000 and for years after 2026 and before 2030, the phase down begins at 101 percent of the dollar amount in effect for the taxable year of the preceding year. The SALT Cap will never go below $10,000.

Certain exclusions from gross income provided under the Code for U.S. citizens or residents living abroad, or for residents of Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands or Puerto Rico are added back to MAGI for purposes of computing the phase down.

State Income Tax Nexus Protection (Public Law 86-272)

Some were hoping that the Legislation would modernize and expand Public Law 86-272’s protections from state income taxes, which have remained unchanged since 1959. In short, Public Law 86-272 prevents states from imposing net income taxes on businesses whose only contact with the state is the solicitation of orders for tangible personal property. An increasing number of states have taken the position that Public Law 86-272 does not protect companies operating a modern website and conducting other virtual activities. Public Law 86-272 modernization protections likely were left out of the Legislation.

Qualified Small Business Stock

The Legislation amends Code section 1202 in three taxpayer beneficial ways. First, a partial exclusion from the sale of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) now starts after a three-year holding period. Second, the amount of eligible gain that may be excluded is increased. Third, the definition of “qualified small business” is broadened to include businesses with gross assets of up to $75 million.

Code Section 1202 now provides for a partial exclusion of gain from the sale of QSBS acquired after the date of enactment and held for three and four years of 50 percent and 75 percent of eligible gain, respectively. The exclusion for eligible gain from the sale of QSBS held for five years or more continues to be 100 percent. Prior law allowed for a 100 percent exclusion of eligible gain, but only if the taxpayer held the QSBS for five years (although rollovers were permitted).

The amount of eligible gain that may be excluded is increased from $10 million to $15 million and for years after 2026, the eligible gain amount is indexed for inflation.

Under prior law, to qualify as a “qualified small business” the aggregate gross assets of the corporation could not exceed $50 million. The new law increases the amount of gross assets to $75 million, which also is indexed for inflation.

Section 199A Qualified Business Income Deduction

The Legislation makes permanent Section 199A, which provides a non-corporate taxpayer a deduction for up to 20 percent of “qualified business income,” including from passthrough entities, and certain other amounts. Prior to amendment, Section 199A was scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2025.

The Legislation makes two additional taxpayer-favorable changes:

By way of background, qualified business income includes certain income, gain, deduction and loss with respect to a “qualified trade or business,” but not a “specified service trade or business” (such as law, accounting, and consulting firms, as well as investment management and finance-related businesses). Also, the deduction cannot exceed certain thresholds based on the qualified trade or business’s W-2 wages and certain basis determinations. The specified service trade or business, W-2 wages, and basis limitations do not apply if a taxpayer’s income is below a specified income threshold adjusted annually for inflation ($197,300 for non-joint filers and $394,600 for joint filers in 2025), and they are phased-in if the taxpayer’s income is less than the sum of (i) the income threshold and (ii) $50,000 in the case of non-joint filers and $100,000 in the case of joint filers (the Phase-in Amounts). The Legislation expands the phase-in range by increasing the Phase-in Amounts from $50,000 to $75,000 for non-joint filers and from $100,000 to $150,000 for joint filers.

The Legislation provides a minimum (inflation-adjusted) $400 deduction for taxpayers having at least $1,000 of qualified business income from one or more “active qualifying trade[s] or business[es]” (generally any qualified trade or business in which the taxpayer materially participates within the meaning of Section 469(h)).

The amendments to Section 199A are effective for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 461(l) Limitation on Excess Business Loss

The Legislation makes permanent Section 461(l), which disallows a non-corporate taxpayer’s “excess business loss” (generally, net business loss exceeding a threshold amount adjusted for inflation; the threshold amount for 2025 is $313,000 for non-joint filers and $626,000 for joint filers). Disallowed loss generally is treated as a net operating loss and carried over to the succeeding taxable year. Prior to the Legislation, Section 461(l) was scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2028. An earlier Senate version included language, ultimately dropped, that would have treated carried forward excess business loss as excess business loss subject to the Section 461(l) limitation.

This amendment to Section 461(l) is effective for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026.

Section 707(a)(2) Disguised Sale Rules

The Legislation amends the partnership “disguised sale” rules, apparently to clarify that they are self-executing.

By way of background, Section 707(a)(2) provides that certain transactions occurring between a partner and partnership may be recharacterized as occurring between (i) the partnership and a person who is not acting as a partner or (ii) two or more partners, none of whom is acting as a partner. The rules may apply when a partner performs services for the partnership or transfers property to the partnership and there is a related direct or indirect allocation and distribution from the partnership to the partner, and when a partner directly or indirectly transfers money or other property to the partnership and there is a related direct or indirect transfer of money or other property by the partnership to the partner. While final regulations on disguised sales of property are long-standing, Treasury and the IRS have not issued final regulations on disguised sales of partnership interests or on disguised payments for services.

Prior to amendment, Section 707(a)(2) began with the text “Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.” The Legislation modifies that text to state, “Except as provided by the Secretary,” resolving any uncertainty about whether the disguised sale rules apply in the absence of final regulations. The amendment is effective for services performed and property transferred after July 4, 2025, and states that it shall not be construed as creating any inference with respect to services performed or property transferred on or before July 4, 2025.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

The Legislation amends the 75-percent asset value test in Section 856(c)(4), which an entity must satisfy to qualify as a REIT, to increase permitted ownership of taxable REIT subsidiary stock from 20 percent to 25 percent. The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Oil and Gas Intangible Drilling Costs

The Legislation allows oil and gas companies to exempt intangible drilling and development costs from their adjusted financial statement income when calculating their corporate AMT.

Exclusion from Gross Income of Interest on Loans Secured by Rural or Agricultural Real Property

The Legislation excludes from gross income 25 percent of interest income received from certain rural or agricultural real estate loans (including loans on certain farms, ranches and aquaculture facilities) made after the date of enactment of the Legislation by FDIC-insured banks and certain domestic entities owned by a bank holding company or insurance holding company, state or federally-regulated insurance companies or Farmer Mac. The Legislation includes a corresponding provision that operates to generally limit the ability of such lenders to deduct 25 percent of any interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to finance such rural or agricultural real estate loans. The exclusion from gross income (and related limitation on interest deductibility) is applicable for taxable years ending after the date of enactment of the Legislation.

Opportunity Zones

As background, the Opportunity Zone (OZ) program was created as part of the TCJA with the goal of increasing long-term investments in low-income communities. Under TCJA, the OZ program generally permits taxpayers to defer recognizing certain types of realized gains (and in some cases to permanently exclude from gross income a portion thereof) if they invest the amount of their gain into a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) within a 180-day period. The Legislation provides for the (OZ) program to become a permanent fixture of the Code.

New Opportunity Zone Designations

Beginning Jan. 1, 2027, there will be rolling 10-year OZ designations (i.e., every 10 years census tracts will be reviewed to determine if they still qualify for OZ designation, and the State governors will have the opportunity to re-designate OZs in their states based on the updated census tract information). The Legislation also narrows the eligibility criteria for designation as an OZ, including eliminating the ability to designate census tracts as OZs that by themselves do not qualify but that are “contiguous” to qualifying census tracts.

Modification of Current OZ Benefits

Under the current OZ program, if a taxpayer holds an investment in a QOF for at least five years, the taxpayer receives a basis step-up equal to 10 percent of the deferred gain (i.e., effectively providing the taxpayer with a permanent gain exclusion equal to 10 percent). If the investment is held for at least seven years, an additional 5 percent basis step-up is provided. The Legislation retains the ability of a taxpayer who makes an investment into a QOF after Dec. 31, 2026, to permanently exclude 10 percent of the deferred gain if the taxpayer holds his QOF investment for at least five years. The additional 5 percent basis step-up/ permanent exclusion for a seven-year hold included in the TCJA is not available for investments made after 2026.

Also under the current OZ program, if a taxpayer holds an investment in a QOF for at least 10 years, the taxpayer gets a basis step-up to fair market value (FMV) on the date the investment is sold or exchanged (i.e., effectively providing the taxpayer with full tax-free appreciation on the investment). The Legislation modifies this benefit for taxpayers that hold on to their QOF investments for more than 30 years by limiting their basis step-up to the FMV of their investment on that 30-year anniversary date.

The new “income recognition” date for investments made in QOFs after Dec. 31, 2026, is the earlier of (i) the date the investment is sold or exchanged, or (ii) the date that is five years after the investment in the QOF. Thus, unlike in the current statutory scheme where the “income recognition date” is a set Dec. 31, 2026 (unless the investment is sold earlier), every taxpayer investing in a QOF after 2026 will be able to defer its gain for a set five years as long as such investment is held for such 5-year period.

New Benefits for Investments in Rural Area OZs

If an investor holds an interest in a QOF that invests, directly or indirectly, in a sufficient amount of tangible property used in a “rural” OZ, the 10 percent exclusion attributable to a five-year holding period is increased to 30 percent. Additionally, the “substantial improvement” requirement for qualifying OZ property is relaxed for property located in a rural OZ.

New Reporting

The Legislation creates new annual reporting requirements for QOFs and qualifying entities in which QOFs invest (i.e., qualified opportunity zone businesses, or QOZBs) and institutes penalties for late filing. Among other items, information on the number of residential units held by, and full-time employees of, the QOF and/or QOZB will now be required to be reported annually. The Legislation also requires the Treasury to prepare publicly available reports summarizing information related to, among other things, the number and dollar value of investments in QOFs and the impact of such investments on the designated OZs.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

The Legislation makes the following changes to the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) under Section 42 of the Code:

State Housing Credit Ceiling Increase

The Legislation includes a permanent 12 percent increase to the annual 9 percent LIHTC allocation.

Expansion of Tax-Exempt Bond Financing Provision

Under the current LIHTC rules, if 50 percent or more of the aggregate basis of a building and land is financed with tax-exempt bonds that are subject to the state’s volume cap, that entire building would be eligible for 4 percent credits without an allocation from the state (as opposed to just the portion of the building financed with the bonds). The Legislation generally expands that favorable rule to buildings, at least 25 percent of the aggregate basis of which are financed with tax-exempt bonds.

New Markets Tax Credit

The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program was created as part of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000, with the goal of encouraging investment in low-income communities (LICs). The program operates by having certified community development entities (CDEs) apply to the CDFI Fund for a NMTC allocation, which CDEs can then “award” to projects operating in LICs, generally based on each CDE’s chosen “economic development” criteria. An investor will thereafter make an equity investment into an affiliate of the CDE (the Sub-CDE), which will be combined with other project funds in order to arrive at the amount of the NMTC allocation awarded to the project. These combined proceeds will then be used by the Sub-CDE to make loans, with favorable terms, to the project entity. The result of this structure is an aggregate NMTC equal to 39 percent X the NMTC allocation, which is available to the investor over a seven-year period.

For each of the years 2024 and 2025, the total amount of NMTC allocations available to be awarded to CDEs is $5 billion. Awards for this $10 billion “double round” are expected to be announced in the fall of 2025. The program has never been permanent, but has always been extended in annual increments prior to any expiration date, with the most recent five-year extension coming in 2020. Without a legislative extension, the awards to be announced this fall would have been the final round and the NMTC program would have expired at the end of 2025.

The Legislation provides for a permanent extension of the NMTC program with $5 billion of allocations available to be awarded to CDEs on an annual basis beginning in 2026.

Information Reporting and Form 1099K – Repeal of Revision to De Minimis Rules for Third-Party Network Transactions

Under current law, third-party settlement organizations (TPSOs), such as online marketplaces, are required to report certain payment transactions for goods and services that exceed a minimum threshold of $600 to the IRS and to the sellers using their platforms (“participating payees”) on Form 1099-K. A TPSO is the central organization that provides a third-party payment network and has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) lowered the threshold for Form 1099-K reporting applicable to third-party payment network transactions to $600, effective for calendar year 2022. However, the IRS has repeatedly delayed full implementation of the $600 threshold. Prior to the change, a de minimisexception only required reporting if the gross amount of the payment transactions with respect to a participating payee for the year exceeded $20,000 and the aggregate number of such transactions exceeded 200. Due to the delays in implementing the change in reporting thresholds, for calendar year 2024, TPSOs were required to file a Form 1099-K for participating payees receiving gross payments exceeding $5,000, regardless of the number of transactions. This threshold decreased to $2,500 for calendar year 2025 and then to $600, as originally mandated by the ARPA, for calendar years after 2025.

The Legislation reverts to the previous de minimisreporting exception for TPSOs so that a TPSO would not be required to report with respect to payment transactions of its participating payees unless the gross amount of the transactions exceeds $20,000 and the aggregate number of such transactions exceeds 200. The reinstatement of the de minimisexception applies as if included in the ARPA and thus applies to returns for calendar years beginning after Dec. 31, 2021.

Increase in Threshold for Requiring Information Reporting with Respect to Certain Payees

The Legislation increases the information reporting threshold for certain payments made by persons engaged in a trade or business to another person (Code Section 6041(a)) and payments of remuneration for services (Code Section 6041A(a)) from $600 to $2,000 in a calendar year. The threshold amount would be adjusted for inflation in calendar years after 2026. No change is made to the information reporting threshold for direct sales (Code Section 6041A(b)). The increase in the information reporting threshold applies with respect to payments made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Employee Retention Tax Credit Provisions

The CARES Act created the Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERTC”) in March of 2021. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 also included ERTC provisions. The ERTC provided a refundable tax credit for portions of payroll taxes that were paid during the COVID-19 crisis. The Legislation changes several provisions regarding the administration and enforcement of the ERTC as follows:

Statute of Limitations:

The Legislation disallows ERTC refund claims for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 filed after Jan. 31, 2024. The statute of limitations on assessments for those claims is extended to six years from several possible starting dates. Before passage of the Legislation, taxpayers had until April 15, 2024, to claim the ERTC for any applicable payroll taxes in 2020 and until April 15, 2025, for any applicable payroll taxes in 2021. The House version would have disallowed ERTC claims for all quarters filed after Jan. 31, 2024, but the Byrd rule prevents changes affecting Social Security from inclusion in reconciliation legislation. For the third and fourth quarters of 2021, ERTC claims were against Medicare taxes.

Enforcement Provisions Against Promoters:

The Legislation imposes penalties and reporting requirements on “COVID-ERTC Promoters.” A COVID-ERTC Promoter is any person providing “aid, assistance, or advice” to taxpayers in filing an ERTC claim and deriving a significant portion of their revenue from such assistance. Certified PEOs are explicitly excluded from qualifying as a COVID-ERTC Promoter. The Legislation requires COVID-ERTC Promoters to comply with certain due diligence requirements with respect to a taxpayer’s eligibility for the ERTC and imposes a $1,000 penalty for each failure to comply with such due diligence requirements.

Individual Tax Changes

With respect to individual taxes, the Legislation, among other items:

Makes TCJA individual tax rates and the standard deduction permanent, with some helpful adjustments; specifically, it permanently extends and increases individual tax bracket values and provides an additional year of inflation indexing

Makes the TCJA standard deduction increases permanent, retroactive to include tax year 2025;

Continues elimination of personal exemptions by permanently setting the deduction amount to zero, except provides a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors (discussed immediately below);

Adds a temporary deduction of $6,000 under Section 151 (personal exemptions) for seniors for tax years 2025 through 2028 for those earning $75,000 or less ($150,000 for joint filers) with a phase-out for excess earnings up to $175,000 ($250,000 joint filers) to help offset taxation of Social Security income;

Permanently repeals miscellaneous itemized deductions (but restores deductions of unreimbursed educator expenses for teachers);

Caps the value of itemized deductions at 35 percent and places a floor of .5% on itemized deductions of charitable contributions;

Allows charitable contribution deduction for individuals who do not itemize deductions ($1,000 for single filers; $2,000 for joint filers);

Makes permanent the Section 199A deduction at 20 percent with modest beneficial changes (discussed above in greater detail);

Permanently increases the child tax credit by $200 to $2,200, effective for 2025 and indexes for inflation (also makes permanent the $1400 refundable child credit, indexed for inflation); subject to income phase-outs at $200,000 ($400,000 for joint filers); both taxpayers and dependents must have Social Security numbers in order to claim;

Makes permanent the $500 nonrefundable credit for dependents other than a qualifying child;

Establishes Trump investment accounts for children, which are eligible to receive contributions of up to $5,000 annually and also would receive $1,000 from the federal government for children born from 2025 through 2028 (more detail below);

Eliminates tax on tips for tax years 2025-2028, capped at a $25,000 federal income tax deduction, with phase-outs for those earning more than $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers);

Eliminates tax on overtime for tax years 2025-2028, generally limited to a federal income tax deduction of $12,500 ($25,000 for joint filers), with phase-outs for those earning more than $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers);

Allow a deduction for certain new car loan interest (only if the vehicle’s final assembly occurs in the U.S.) of up to $10,000 for tax years 2025 through 2028 for those earning $100,000 or less ($200,000 for joint filers), with a phase-down thereafter;

Makes TCJA’s increased alternative minimum tax exemptions permanent at 2018 exemption phaseout levels of $500,000 ($1 million for joint filers) and indexes for inflation. Increases phaseout of the exemption amount to 50 percent (from 25 percent) of the amount by which a taxpayers AMT income exceeds the threshold amount;

Makes permanent TCJA limits regarding deductions of mortgage interest ($750,000 of acquisition indebtedness and no deductions relating to home equity lines); adds provision treating certain mortgage insurance premiums on acquisition indebtedness as qualified residence interest.

Extends and modifies limitations on wagering losses, limits the definition of annual wagering losses to 90 percent of actual losses and then allows deductions of those losses only to the extent of total annual wagering gains;

Eliminates Section 217 moving expense deduction except for members of the armed forces and certain members of the intelligence community;

Makes permanent and modifies (to include state-declared disasters) limitations regarding personal casualty losses (generally requiring itemization to claim and subject to floor of 10 percent of AGI).

Trump Accounts

The Legislation establishes a new type of custodial account for minors. Trump accounts would be a form of Individual Retirement Account (but not a Roth IRA) and would generally be treated in the same manner as an IRA. Key features include:

Eligibility and Characteristics: To be eligible for a Trump account, the account beneficiary must be below the age of 18 before the close of the calendar year in which the account is established and have a Social Security number. Trump account funds can grow tax-free until they are withdrawn but must be invested in mutual funds or ETFs that track the returns of a qualified index (such as the S&P 500 or other index funds that are primarily comprised of U.S. companies), do not use leverage, do not have annual fees and expenses of more than .1 percent of the balance of the fund investment and meet other criteria Treasury determines appropriate. Under the Legislation, Treasury could set up Trump accounts for individuals whom it identifies as eligible and for which no Trump account has already been established.

Contributions: The contribution limit for a taxable year is $5,000 (other than qualified rollover contributions) and is adjusted for inflation for taxable years after 2027. Contributions can only be made in calendar years before the beneficiary turns 18 and will not be accepted until 12 months after the date of enactment of the Legislation. U.S. federal, state, local, and tribal governments as well as charitable organizations could make “general funding contributions,” which would be contributions made to a specified qualified class of Trump account beneficiaries, and these contributions would not be subject to the $5,000 limit. No deduction is allowed for any contributions to a Trump account made before the first day of the calendar year in which the beneficiary turns 18.

Employer Contributions: Employers may contribute up to $2,500 (adjusted for inflation for taxable years after 2027) to the Trump account of an employee or the employee’s dependent without it being taxable to the employee.

Distributions: No distributions are permitted before the first day of the calendar year in which the beneficiary turns 18 (other than distributions of qualified rollover contributions). The rules applicable to distributions from IRAs generally apply.

Pilot Program: Under a pilot program, Treasury will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 to the Trump account of each qualifying child born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, and who is a U.S. citizen and has a Social Security number.

Estate and Gift Tax Exemption Changes

Currently, the federal estate and gift tax exemption is an inflation-adjusted amount of $13.99 million per individual for 2025, though under prior law that amount was set to drop to an estimated inflation-adjusted amount of $7.14 million for tax year 2026. The Legislation permanently increases the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million per individual for tax years 2026 and beyond. The $15 million exemption amount is indexed for inflation, meaning for tax years after 2026 the $15 million exemption amount will be increased based on inflation adjustments. The federal generation-skipping transfer tax exemption is permanently increased by the Legislation to an inflation-indexed amount of $15 million.

Premium Tax Credit Limitations

The Premium Tax Credit, which helps lower-income individuals afford health insurance through the federal exchange, would be restricted by the Legislation to a narrower group of lawfully present noncitizens. Eligible individuals must either be lawful permanent residents, Cuban nationals with approved petitions awaiting visa availability or individuals lawfully residing under a Compact of Free Association.

Excluded from eligibility would be asylum seekers, parolees, Temporary Protected Status recipients, individuals granted deferred action or enforced departure, and those granted withholding of removal. These individuals, though lawfully present, would no longer qualify for the credit. Additionally, the Legislation proposes to repeal the provision that allowed noncitizens with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level to access the credit if they were ineligible for Medicaid due to immigration status. It also updates Affordable Care Act provisions to align with these new restrictions, including related subsidies and health program access.

New Excise Tax on Remittance Transfers

A new 1 percent excise tax would apply to certain international remittance transfers from the U.S. Such transfers would not include certain small-value transactions. If the excise tax is not paid by the sender, the provider would be required to collect and remit it. The Legislation provides two exceptions for U.S. citizens and nationals. Taxpayers may use a qualified provider that verifies citizenship (for example, by withdrawing funds from a bank account or charging the remittance to a credit or debit card) and also may claim a refundable tax credit by providing a Social Security number and proof of payment. Providers are required to report detailed remittance data, including sender information, amounts transferred, and taxes collected for credit-eligible individuals.

Social Security Number Requirement for Education Credits

The Legislation tightens requirements for claiming the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning education credits. A valid Social Security Number would be required for the taxpayer, spouse (if applicable) and any student for whom education expenses are claimed, replacing the more flexible taxpayer identification number requirement.

Exempt Organization Changes

Increased University Endowment Tax (Section 4968)

The Legislation increases the tax on college and university net investment income from 1.4 percent to 8 percent for institutions with a “student adjusted endowment” above $2 million. Schools with student adjusted endowments of between $750,000 and $2 million per student will see their net investment income tax increase from 1.4 percent to 4 percent. The Legislation also expands which institutions are subject to the tax, but it excludes smaller schools with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students. Assets and net investment income of related organizations are generally included in the income calculation, as are student loan interest and royalty income. The changes are estimated to cost universities $761 million over 10 years.

Significant Tax Increases: Institutions with large endowments per student face dramatic increases in excise tax liability.

Broader Scope: Many institutions previously not subject to the tax may become subject to it due to the expanded definitions and inclusion of student loan interest and royalty income from intellectual property developed by students and faculty members using federal funding, as well as related organizations’ assets and income.

New Compliance Burdens: Enhanced reporting and anti-avoidance rules will require careful review of endowment investments, royalty structures, and related entities.

Immediate Planning: Institutions should begin modeling the impact of these changes and consider how their endowment management, investment strategies and organizational structures may be affected and optimized.

Expansion of the Tax on Excess Compensation (Section 4960)

The Legislation expands the application of the tax paid by tax-exempt organizations on compensation over $1 million and certain severance payments. The definition of “covered employee” is broadened to include any employee (including any former employees employed on or after Jan. 1, 2017) of an applicable tax-exempt organization or any predecessor of such organization—not just the “high five” compensated individuals to which this section currently applies. This expansion significantly increases the number of individuals who will trigger the tax. The change is expected to cost tax-exempt organizations more than $3.8 billion over 10 years.

Modification to Charitable Contribution Deduction

The Legislation reinstates a partial charitable contribution deduction for individuals who do not itemize deductions ($1,000 for single filers; $2,000 for joint filers), at a cost to the federal government of $73.8 billion over 10 years. This cost is offset by a 0.5 percent floor on the deduction of contributions for those who do itemize, which is estimated to raise $63 billion. A similar 1 percent floor on corporate charitable deductions is estimated to raise $16.6 billion.

All of these provisions apply to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Employer-Provided Benefits

The Legislation includes a handful of provisions that affect benefits provided by employers as well as provisions related to compensation paid to certain employees.

Health Savings Account Changes

Current health savings account (HSA) rules disqualify individuals from making contributions to an HSA under certain circumstances, and the Legislation liberalizes a few of these rules.

Telehealth

A COVID-era exemption previously allowed individuals to receive telehealth services without applying a deductible and maintain eligibility to make HSA contributions. The Legislation retroactively reinstates the exemption to when the original exemption expired and makes the exemption permanent.

Direct Primary Care Service Arrangements

The Legislation also allows an individual to remain eligible to make HSA contributions if the individual participates in a “direct primary care service arrangement,” which generally means an arrangement whereby the individual receives primary care services from primary care providers in exchange for a fixed fee. This eligibility rule does not apply if the fixed fee exceeds $150 per month ($300 per month if the arrangement applies to multiple individuals), and such amounts will be adjusted annually. In addition, direct primary care service arrangement fees are treated as medical expenses that can be paid using an HSA.

These direct primary care services arrangement changes apply to months beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Educational Assistance

Code Section 127 allows employers to offer certain amounts of educational assistance tax-free to employees. The definition of “educational assistance” was previously expanded to include assistance related to an employee’s student loans. The Legislation makes this expansion, which was set to expire at the end of 2025, permanent. The Legislation also adds language providing for an inflation adjustment with respect to the maximum tax exclusion (currently $5,250) for education assistance furnished in a calendar year.

Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account Contribution Increased to $7,500 ($3,750 for Married Individuals Filing Separately)

Employers may offer employees dependent care flexible spending accounts (DCFSAs), which generally allow employees to contribute wages to a DCFSA pre-tax and then use the DCFSA to reimburse, on a tax-free basis, dependent care expenses incurred by the employee. For many years, the maximum DCFSA contribution amount has been $5,000 ($2,500 for married individuals filing separately). The Legislation increases those amounts to $7,500 and $3,750, respectively, for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Commuter Benefit Programs

The ability to offer tax-free reimbursement for bicycle commuting expenses, sometimes called a “transportation fringe,” has been permanently eliminated under the Legislation.

Executive Compensation in Excess of $1 Million

Currently, public companies cannot deduct more than $1 million with respect to compensation for a small number of top employees (technically called “covered employees”). For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, the Legislation modifies the rule to apply it to “specified covered employees” in the public company’s controlled group. Specifically, (i) a specified covered employee’s compensation from all controlled group members will be considered; and (ii) in determining who the specified covered employees are, identifying the five highest-paid employees would be determined by analyzing the entire controlled group’s employee population. Other than the criteria above, specified covered employees will be determined by the other three existing criteria used for identifying “covered employees,” which would still apply based solely on the public company’s employee population.

The Code contains a corollary provision for nonexempt organizations in the form of an excise tax on compensation exceeding $1 million, which the Legislation modifies. This modification is addressed above, in the “Exempt Organization Proposed Changes”section.

Deduction for Employer-Provided Meals

Effective for amounts paid or incurred after Dec. 31, 2025, the TCJA added a prohibition on deductions for certain expenses related to (1) meals provided to employees and their spouses and dependents by the employer on its premises, and (2) an employer’s operation of an eating facility for employees (including food and beverage costs). The Legislation retains this deduction prohibition but adds a small carve-out. Specifically, the deduction prohibition will not apply if the expenses relate to (i) a good or service for which the employer receives adequate consideration in a bona fide transaction, or (ii) food or beverages provided on or at certain commercial vessels, oil or gas platforms, and fishing vessels or fish processing facilities.

Miscellaneous Items

Qualified Sound Recording Productions Eligible for Expensing and Bonus Depreciation

The Legislation adds a new category, “qualified sound recording productions” to the special expensing rules that already apply to qualified film, television and live theatrical productions under Section 181 of the Code. A qualified sound recording production is a sound recording (as defined under U.S. copyright law) produced and recorded in the U.S. Sound recording production costs of up to $150,000, in total, in the taxable year would be allowed as a deduction. However, as with qualified film, television and live theatrical productions, the Section 181 deduction only applies to qualified sound recording productions that commence before Jan. 1, 2026. Consequently, the Section 181 deduction will be of limited benefit since only sound recording productions commencing in taxable years ending after the date of enactment of the Legislation and before Jan. 1, 2026, will be eligible for the Section 181 deduction.

The Legislation also makes qualified sound recording productions placed in service in a taxable year eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) of the Code. A qualified sound recording production will be considered placed in service at the time of initial release or broadcast. The bonus depreciation amendments apply to qualified sound recording productions commencing in taxable years ending after the date of enactment of the Legislation.

Reduction of Excise Tax on the Transfer or Manufacture of Certain Firearms

The National Firearms Act, codified in Chapter 53 of the Code, generally imposes a $200 excise tax on each transfer or manufacture of a firearm (the excise tax is $5 for weapons capable of being concealed). The Legislation eliminates the transfer tax and manufacture tax on most firearms (excise tax is reduced to zero) and imposes a $200 transfer tax and manufacture tax only on machine guns and destructive devices. The reduction in excise tax is effective for calendar quarters beginning more than 90 days after the date of enactment of the Legislation.

Reduction in CFPB’s Mandatory Funding Structure, and Similar Items

The Legislation reduces the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB or Bureau) mandatory funding structure. Established by Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act (PL 111-203), the CFPB’s funding does not come from Congress through the annual appropriations process. Rather the Bureau’s funding comes from the Federal Reserve’s operations. The Dodd-Frank Act provided that the CFPB requests funds directly from the Federal Reserve, up to a statutory limit. However, the Dodd-Frank Act did not establish a minimum CFPB funding level. The Legislation reduces the maximum limit from 12 percent to 6.5 percent but does not alter the CFPB’s statutory functions and duties, including the semi-annual testimony by the CFPB Director to Congress. The Legislation also eliminates the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Reserve Fund, established by Title IX, Section 991, of the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC had used the Fund for technology investments. On Oct. 1, 2025, the Legislation requires the SEC to transfer both the obligated and unobligated balance in the Reserve Fund to the Treasury Department and closes the Fund. Finally, the Legislation rescinds the unobligated funds of the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program established by the Inflation Reduction Act. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) noted that the Legislation will “deliver on President Trump’s mandate to cut waste and duplication in our federal government and save hardworking taxpayer dollars” and House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-AR) stated, “I am proud of the House Financial Services Committee's contributions to the meaningful spending reductions in this bill.”

Conclusion

With this first Trump Administration budget reconciliation bill enacted, taxpayers should determine the expected impacts on their business plans, transaction pipelines, anticipated restructurings, operational affairs and estate plans and consider adjustments as appropriate.

Some of the proposed changes and spending cuts that were dropped solely because the Senate Parliamentarian ruled that inclusion would have violated the “Byrd Rule” that governs the reconciliation process may be revisited during the FY 2026 appropriations process and through standalone legislation during the remainder of the 119th Congress. With respect to provisions included in the Legislation, taxpayers should turn their focus toward offering input as the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service develop and issue implementing regulations and related guidance.

There is likely to be one or more additional reconciliation bills during late 2025 and 2026 and therefore additional opportunities for enactment of additional provisions, as well as changes and improvements to the Legislation.

Soybean oil futures were up the limit and soybean futures jumped more than 25 cents.
If finalized, the rule removes one element of uncertainty clouding soybean oil and soybean demand.","The use of soybean oil to produce renewable diesel is critical to soybean demand and its potential growth. Soybean oil usage for biofuel production is projected at 13.9 billion pounds in marketing year 2025/26 (Sept. 1, 2025-Aug. 30, 2026) and accounts for approximately 45% of soybean oil usage in the U.S. Left to the private market, there would be no demand for renewable diesel because of its cost compared to conventional diesel. However, the renewable volume obligations (RVOs) set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the renewable fuel standard (RFS) help overcome the cost difference by mandating biomass diesel fuel usage. Low carbon fuel standards (LCFS) adopted by California, Oregon, and Washington have also boosted demand.

Because demand for renewable diesel is driven by government policy it is effectively capped at the mandated amount. Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, last year pegged the cap at 4.0-4.5 billion gallons, yet production capacity has been estimated around 7.0 billion gallons. Thus, soybean growers, processors, and biofuel advocates have been lobbying the EPA to increase the RVOs when setting the mandates under the RFS for 2026 and 2027. The industry sought an RVO of 5.25 billion gallons and has lobbied to restrict imports of renewable diesel or foreign feedstocks, like used cooking oil from China, to protect domestic sources.

Thus, it was a pleasant day for the sector when on June 13 the EPA announced a proposed rule to raise the RVOs for biomass-based diesel (biodiesel and renewable diesel) to 5.61 billion RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers) for 2026 and 5.86 billion for 2027, levels exceeding what the industry was seeking (Figure 1). According to Faith Parum, an economist for American Farm Bureau, RINs are credits based on the production of biofuels. Each gallon of renewable fuel produced is assigned a RIN. Aaron Smith, an economist at the University of California-Berkley, says that depending on the level of imports, the new rule will require the usage of between 4.45-5.7 billion gallons next year. Smith also noted the new rule specifies that imported fuel and fuel made domestically with imported feedstocks can earn only half the credits of domestically-produced fuel, giving a leg-up to domestic fuels and feedstocks. The EPA says the proposed rule sets the highest volume requirements ever under the RFS.

Their NextCycle Michigan pitch sought funding for a Food Waste Diversion Director position and to train and deploy three more food waste team members.","As the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) pursues the state’s bold goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and a 45% recycling rate by 2030, food waste reduction and composting have emerged as key strategies where these goals can be addressed simultaneously. Specifically, the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan calls for cutting food waste by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030.

In a Planet Detroit article, Julie Staveland, assistant division director for EGLE’s Materials Management Division said, “EGLE is investing in this issue because reducing food waste is one of the lowest-hanging fruit we can address to help us reach our climate goals, as identified in the MI Healthy Climate Plan.”

NextCycle Michigan is one of the primary programs EGLE is using to address food waste management. The NextCycle Michigan Accelerator program advances on-the-ground projects that will reduce waste or increase reuse, recycling, or composting in Michigan.

In just the first four years of the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator, nearly two dozen teams took advantage of the program to take their food-recovery-related projects to the next level. This article highlights six teams and one NextCycle Michigan network partner.

Redirecting surplus food

Both the U.S. EPA and Michigan EGLE have published guidance on sustainable food waste management activities ranking food waste prevention and food surplus donation and upcycling as preferred strategies to reduce environmental impacts. NextCycle Michigan alum team Metro Food Rescue and network partner Make Food Not Waste operate, and cooperate, in this space.

Metro Food Rescue is a food rescue organization in metro Detroit serving as a link between businesses with food to donate—bakeries, manufacturers, farmers, caterers, event centers, and the like—and pantries and soup kitchens which provide food to people in need. In 2023 they provided nearly two million meals to their neighbors while simultaneously cutting greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 4,000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2E). Working with mentors and consultants provided by NextCycle Michigan, Metro Food Rescue explored revenue models and built partnerships with more food generators and pantries. They are on track to grow their impact to 15 million meals per year by 2027.

Make Food Not Waste (MFNW), a NextCycle Michigan Partner, is one of the organizations that receives donated food from Metro Food Rescue. They use the food at their Upcycling Kitchens—located at a Presbyterian church and a Salvation Army center that provides services for those suffering from addiction—to create delicious, nutritious, and complete meals for the community.

Danielle Todd, executive director of MFNW said, “Metro Food Rescue is one of our favorite partners and one that we recommend all of the time to potential food donors. We know we can count on them to respond right away and to make the rescue work not only for food donors but also for people like us who rely on regular food donations to serve the community.”

Food waste composting in cities and townships

Ferndale (Oakland County)

The City of Ferndale, in Oakland County, managed a popular pilot food-waste drop-off composting program serving both residential and commercial customers with support from the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator program. With NextCycle’s mentors and consultants, they estimated food waste production and recovery potential, analyzed growth options, researched composting technologies, projected costs, identified grantors, and honed their pitch for further funding.

Building on the success of the pilot, they joined the a second NextCycle Michigan cohort to get help in developing a composting system within the city to process the collected organics.

Claire Dion, former Zero Waste Program Coordinator at the City of Ferndale said of the benefits of the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator, “Having our pitch deck and having completed all of the data collection we were able to do, it really is going to set us up for success in applying for grant opportunities.”

Beaver Island – Saint James & Peaine Townships (Charlevoix County)

Saint James and Peaine townships located in Charlevoix County—which, together, encompass Lake Michigan’s Beaver Island—are also worked with NextCycle Michigan to create a composting system for their residents, visitors, and businesses. Beaver Island is the most remote inhabited island in the Great Lakes. It has a year-round population of roughly 600 residents and a summer peak of a few thousand people. There is no regular curbside collection of garbage or recyclables; island residents and businesses must drop it all off at a transfer station and recycling center (TSRC) jointly run by the two townships.

Their location 40 miles from the mainland’s barge dock makes managing materials expensive for the islanders. The island’s property owners pay for waste and recycling services in three ways:

Fees charged when they drop off waste or bulky items at the TSRC,

Townships property taxes allocated to support and run the TSRC, and

Charlevoix County’s recycling millage.

All the island’s recyclable materials and garbage are shipped by barge to the mainland, then a contracted waste hauler moves the waste to a landfill and processes and markets the recyclables. The TSRC pays for the shipping and management of the trash while the county recycling millage pays for the recyclables.

In two preliminary rounds of technical support -- one under an EGLE MICROS grant and another under a federal Economic Development Administration (EDA) Build-to-Scale grant sponsored by NextCycle Michigan and facilitated by the Centrepolis Accelerator at Lawrence Technological University—existing waste and recycling practices were analyzed and opportunities identified for improvements. They found that food-waste composting offered a win-win-win opportunity to

Save money by decreasing the amount of waste hauled off-island,

Reduce the climate impact of managing their organic waste, and

Improve the island’s sandy soil while reducing the amount of compost shipped to the island.

A NextCycle Michigan team from the island then took part in the another Accelerator cohort, working with their NextCycle Michigan coaches and subject matter experts to determine the best composting system for their unique island. They decided on a home-composting model with an estimated implementation cost of $56,000. Municipal food-waste drop-off alternatives they considered came with equipment, facilities, and site costs between $147,100 and $347,100 and annual operating expenses of $40,000 a year or more. Questions about the availability of workers to run and maintain such a composting site on a part-time basis and markets for the finished compost also weighed against these options.

The islanders’ home composting plan puts education out front, beginning in the summer of 2024, followed by implementation of a pilot program with 50 households in Summer/Fall 2024. The 50 pilot households would include 20 renters and 30 owner-occupied units. Each pilot household would receive a 0.75-gallon caddy for collecting compostables in the kitchen, a 65-gallon composting bin for outdoors, and further education. After evaluating the opportunities and challenges identified through the pilot, a full roll out to the remaining 218 occupied households is anticipated in Winter/Spring 2025. The team calculated the potential diversion from disposal of 110 tons a year.

Collaboration for compost benefits

Detroiter Renee V. Wallace, a longtime process and change consultant serving a variety of businesses and nonprofits, has been following a calling to grow food-scraps composting systems for the benefit of the city for over 15 years. In 2021 she received the prestigious H. Clark Gregory Award from the U.S. Composting Council for outstanding service to the composting industry through grassroots efforts.

Wallace brought together multiple partners to develop a sustainable, equitable system to compost food waste from Wayne State University (WSU) and improve composting at the Georgia Street Community Garden (GSCC). This initiative was assisted by the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator. Renee, along with Mark Covington, president and co-director of GSCC, and the WSU Office of Campus Sustainability (OCS) worked together to get the system up and running.

“We built a program in such a way that it was about integrating two communities, a city, and a campus community,” said Wallace.

Students taking part in the OCS’s Green Warriors program educated WSU students and staff about composting and collecting the compostables from dining halls and other participating campus locations.

Leaders at WSU’s Dining Services Department developed efficient systems to collect pre-consumer food scraps for composting.

The WSU Grounds Services department hauls leaves to GSCC to be blended with the food scraps.

Covington and his GSCC team manage the composting process.

Both GSCC and Wayne State use the finished compost.

Through her consulting service, Doer’s Edge, Wallace also supports NextCycle Michigan’s team recruitment and programming.

Autonomous food waste collection

Scrap Soils is a nonprofit organization offering food waste collection service to households and restaurants in City Council districts 4, 5 and 6 of Detroit. They compost this food waste at hyper-local farm partner locations. Scrap Soils and Orange Sparkle Ball (OSB) developed a pilot project using Ottonomy robots to collect food scraps in the Corktown neighborhood.

Explains Ricky Blanding, founder and CEO of Scrap Soils, “Scrap Soils and OSB had a growing partnership in terms of advisory support and goals for the community. OSB was working on autonomous mobility, and together, we conceptualized their first pilot: using robots to pick up food scraps as part of Scrap Soil’s collection service. We continued together, developing the formation of the project, along with the pilot design and funding strategy.”

The four-week pilot, launched in mid-June 2024. It was funded by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and ran in the City of Detroit’s Transportation Innovation Zone. The robots delivered the food scraps to Brother Nature Produce’s urban farm where the Scrap Soils team composted them.

Looking back on their NextCycle Michigan Accelerator experience, executive director Ricky Blanding appreciated that Scrap Soils was chosen to take part based on prioritizing equitable access and the team’s demographic appeal to the people in the neighborhoods they serve, despite the organization having limited infrastructure. Once the Accelerator was underway, the regular meetings with their mentors helped clarify the strengths each Scrap Soils team member brought to the table. Knowing this helps Blanding to more accurately delegate to everyone on the team. They also gained experience using project management platforms like Airtable which have proven valuable in extending their workflows.

Orange Sparkle Ball was one of the teams that pitched at the NextCycle Michigan 2025 Summer Showcase in June. Its pitch was about “Penny Pickup”, the app that manages the autonomous robots that pickup and deliver the “waste” materials for reuse/recycling/composting. While it did not win one of the judge’s or people’s choice awards, it did receive a $5,000 Harvest Grant from EGLE.

Education is essential

SEEDS Ecology and Education Centers is a nonprofit established in 1999 to implement environmental solutions locally using intersecting expertise in ecology, education, and design. In 2018 SEEDS convened the Northwest Michigan Organic Waste Diversion Advisory Partners (NWMI OWDA). As EGLE began directing Renew Michigan funds toward this arena, implementing NextCycle Michigan, and requiring counties to prepare Sustainable Materials Management Plans—which must address organic wastes—SEEDS has leapt at every opportunity.

In 2021 they commissioned a market assessment covering 10 counties from Missaukee County north to Emmet County and west to Lake Michigan. The report was funded by Rotary Charities of Traverse City and EGLE’s Recycling Market Development grant program. At the same time, SEEDS took part in a NextCycle Accelerator cohort to further develop their community-scale food-waste drop-off model and prepare to access funding to expand capacity across the region to collect, haul and process organics.

The 134-page market assessment report was released early 2022 and provides all stakeholders with a rich understanding of food scraps, yard waste and woody debris generated in the region; existing diversion efforts and infrastructure from food rescue to composting; the ecosystem of stakeholders; and value-added marketable opportunities.

Next steps identified for the six core NOMI OWDA partners are well underway. Their goal for the region of cutting food waste by 30% by 2030 parallels EGLE’s goal of reducing wasted food by 50% by 2030. SEEDS is continuing with their convening and educational roles, for example by developing a demonstration and training center. Their NextCycle Michigan pitch sought funding for a Food Waste Diversion Director position and to train and deploy three more food waste team members. At the recent 2025 Summer Showcase, they pitched the process of connecting supply and demand for food and wood rescue, compost, and biochars across northwest lower Michigan. While it did not win an award, it did receive a $5,000 Harvest Grant from EGLE.

Large scale composting

NextCycle Michigan Partner Denali is an organics management company with over two dozen locations across the United States. Denali has been active in Michigan producing and selling compost and mulch in partnership with the city of Grand Rapids since 2020 and at the City of Ann Arbor compost facility since 2011.

Denali’s Ann Arbor operation grew with the city program when Ann Arbor began offering food-scraps collection in 2014. Today the city offers single-family residential properties a free 64- or 96-gallon compost cart for yard and food wastes, while commercial entities can subscribe for food-waste collection with fees based on the number of carts and frequency of pick up. As of 2020 17% of total waste generated in Ann Arbor—roughly 12,000 tons—was diverted through composting.

Filling the gaps

NextCycle Michigan Accelerator teams and network partners are making inspiring progress toward meeting the need to recover good food and make the most of unusable food. But this is just the beginning: there is vast opportunity to collect, redirect, and process food scraps in Michigan.

The Michigan Food Waste Roadmap released in March 2024 by the Michigan Sustainable Business Forum reported that to reach the State’s goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030, “...the amount of donated food in the charitable food system must double, while not distracting from efforts to address root causes of food insecurity.” The roadmap also found that “…substantially more surplus food is managed through Michigan charities than through its commercial compost facilities.” Similarly, the 2023 NextCycle Michigan Gap Analysis indicates that over 100 more composting sites are needed to process organics to meet the state’s goals.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/MMD/Food-Waste/Metro-Food-Rescue-NFL.jpg?rev=35bb65c6a606493eb4a918a21c54cff9,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:40.693192

However, tax credits for other sources of low-emission electricity, including nuclear power, hydropower and geothermal energy, will remain available until 2033.","Cuts to clean energy spending in the bill President Donald Trump signed into law on 4 July could lead to billions of tonnes of additional CO2 emissions over the next decade, according to early estimates. The US was already behind on its Paris Agreement pledge to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the slowdown will leave the country – the world’s second-largest emitter after China – even further off track.

“While other countries are benefiting from accelerated investment in the clean energy economy, the US is taking a step backwards,” David Widawsky at the World Resources Institute, an environmental advocacy group, said in a statement.

The sweeping legislation – known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – contains more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $350 billion in new spending for immigration enforcement and the military.

Republicans in Congress included funding cuts to clean energy, along with larger cuts to affordable healthcare and food programs, to offset that spending. Over the next few years, the law will end hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of tax credits aimed at boosting low-emission energy sources and uses established by the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed under the Biden administration.

Researchers at Princeton University modelled how the policy change would affect the US energy system and emissions over the next decade. They found the law substantially slows the decline in US greenhouse gas emissions that were expected under the Biden administration’s policies, effectively repealing the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since a peak of about 6.6 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2005, US emissions have declined by about 17 per cent and were set to fall by about 25 per cent by 2030. Under the new law, the decline is expected to be 20 per cent in 2030, a difference of hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2.

The difference is even more stark in 2035, when more clean energy projects were anticipated to have been built. Under Biden’s policies, emissions were set to fall as much as 44 per cent by then relative to 2005, according to the researchers. Under the new law, they would fall just 25 per cent, a disparity of half a billion tonnes of CO2 per year.

The slowdown would leave US emissions behind its former pledges under the Paris Agreement by about 2 billion tonnes in 2030. In 2035, US emissions would be around 2.5 billion tonnes higher than an emissions trajectory consistent with reaching net zero by mid-century.

The bill includes ending tax credits for electric vehicles this year and phasing out credits for low-emission renewable energy, such as wind and solar, in 2026. Credits for energy efficiency upgrades, such as heat pumps and home insulation, also now end in 2026. The bill cancels the remaining funding for clean energy-related research and development programs.

However, tax credits for other sources of low-emission electricity, including nuclear power, hydropower and geothermal energy, will remain available until 2033. The bill also maintains support for more speculative technologies favoured by the fossil fuel industry, including a tax credit for low-emissions hydrogen production that lasts until 2028 and credits for capturing or removing CO2 from the atmosphere.

Climate advocates decried the passage of the bill for its emissions consequences, as well as ways it could run counter to the Trump administration’s agenda to lower the cost of energy and expand American manufacturing.

“We urgently need more clean, affordable energy, but this measure would bring the renaissance in American clean energy production to a halt and send good, domestic manufacturing jobs to our foreign rivals,” Manish Bapna at the US-based advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement.",https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08191406/sei258255741.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:19.084315

The grant program, created and funded by Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to provide critical support to communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate change. Attorney General Clark and the coalition argue that EPA’s abrupt and unlawful termination of the program and cancellation of grants have already caused widespread harm across their states, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, and are urging the court to block the program termination while the lawsuit continues.

In the brief filed today in Appalachian Voices v. EPA, Attorney General Clark and the coalition emphasize that by terminating this grant program, the federal government is inflicting serious, lasting harm on vulnerable communities already grappling with disproportionate pollution burdens and the escalating effects of climate change. These communities, which are often low-income, communities of color, indigenous, or in rural areas, face overlapping environmental and public health crises.

The attorneys general explain that these challenges have only been made worse by historical discriminatory policies including racial segregation, redlining, and a systemic lack of investment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These communities are often under-resourced with limited access to vital needs like clean drinking water and are less equipped to recover from devastating weather-related events or to mitigate the increasing impact of climate change within their communities.

In 2022, Congress created the grant program under the Inflation Reduction Act, mandating that EPA distribute $3 billion in funding specifically to help address these disparities. Now, the sudden termination of these grants has forced grantees to lay off staff, halt programming, and freeze hiring.

Attorney General Clark and the coalitionnote that EPA’s mass cancellation of the environmental and climate justice grant program violates clear congressional mandates and fundamental constitutional principles. Congress directed the EPA to distribute these funds using mandatory language in the Inflation Reduction Act, leaving the agency no discretion to unilaterally withdraw support.

The coalition is urging the court to grant plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and ensure that the environmental justice grants remain available for the communities that so desperately need them.

The EPA, the chief environmental organization of the United States, has faced enormous pressure in recent years as global warming has fueled more frequent extreme weather events and environmental disasters, and now the Trump administration has impacted the EPA even more.

The EPA Great Lakes Tracker is organized into several key categories useful for understanding and tracking the work and policies of the EPA in the Great Lakes region. Four of these categories relate to the direct work of the EPA: Beach grants; Superfund Sites; Brownfields; and PFAS (“forever chemicals”). The other four categories are unique to the Trump administration’s EPA, including: Regulatory Rollbacks; Employee Firings and Office Closures; and the President’s Budget. This tracker is being released at a critical time in the EPA’s history as the agency faces existential threats and weakened capabilities.

The tracker highlights ways in which the Trump EPA is at odds with itself. Despite EPA claims that emphasize environmental protection and human health, the agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, has gutted many of the programs that achieve these goals and rolled back limits intended to protect American lives. Even in areas that the EPA has held up as accomplishments, such as the cleanup of Superfund and Brownfield sites, the Trump administration is also proposing budget cuts that would undermine those programs in the future.

BEACH Act Grant Program

Last updated: July 1, 2025

The BEACH Act Grant Program funds water quality monitoring, communication in the event of unsafe conditions, and other public health initiatives at over 4,500 beaches nationwide, including those along the Great Lakes. These funds are used to determine if elevated levels of illness-causing bacteria make swimming unsafe and if so, to prevent the public from beachgoing until further notice. Under President Trump, the EPA continues to fund the program with $9.7 million in grants for 2025. The funding is authorized by the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act. Rep. David Joyce, Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, introduced legislation earlier this year that would reauthorize the program through FY 2029 at $30 million per year, equal to the current authorized level. Appropriated funding is currently on par with prior fiscal years. The FY 2026 President’s Budget for the EPA, however, would eliminate the BEACH Grant program, along with other Categorical Grants totaling nearly $1 billion.

Superfund

Last updated: July 1, 2025

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, or Superfund) mandates the EPA to clean up sites across the US contaminated by hazardous waste. Through this program, the areas are slated for cleanup and redeveloped into commercial, recreational, residential, and ecological spaces, such as shopping centers, parks, and more. This work is largely funded by the entities that polluted the areas in the first place. The Trump EPA has touted expedited Superfund cleanup as one of its major accomplishments. In 2025, Superfund sites from Rhode Island to Illinois have undergone major cleanups in an effort to combine environmental revitalization projects with economic development. As of May 1, 2025, $296 million in cleanups were confirmed across the US so far this year, addressing 700,000 cubic yards of contamination. The President’s Budget, however, would cut funding for the Hazardous Substances Superfund account in half, from $537 million in FY 2025 to just $282 million.

Brownfields

Last updated: July 1, 2025

Brownfield sites, former industrial sites that have been contaminated with hazardous substances or carry a risk of such contamination, are an important part of the EPA’s work in environmental restoration and offer incredible benefits for local economies and communities when redeveloped. On May 16, 2025, $267 million in Brownfields Grants were announced for selection to communities across the United States aimed at combining efforts in environmental stewardship and economic growth. This includes $224 million in funding for Brownfields Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup (ARC) Grant programs; and $42 million in supplemental funding to 34 existing Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Grant recipients demonstrating successful brownfield site cleanup and redevelopment. However, current threats to EPA funding, namely the proposed 54% cut to the organization’s budget for FY 2026, would slow down projects and the success of brownfield redevelopment. A March 11 hearing held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on the Environment emphasized the importance of this program and concern about how these cuts might affect brownfield revitalization. Namely, these cuts would deepen administrative delays and barriers, and disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities. The administration’s budget for FY 2026 cuts funding for the Brownfields Projects State and Tribal Assistance Grant from $98 million to $80 million and would completely eliminate funding for the Brownfield Categorical Grant program, funded at $46 million in FY 2025. Cuts to the EPA’s payroll for its staff have also delayed the acquisition of grants and made it difficult to get in contact with individuals from the agency.

With the Brownfields Program, the Trump administration illustrates that its agenda is continuously at odds with itself. Although the current EPA emphasizes the importance of environmental revitalization programs, the administration’s actions fail to align with this priority, and in fact gut the very programs that make revitalization possible.

PFAS

Last updated: July 1, 2025

PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as “forever chemicals,” are chemical substances used in a wide variety of consumer products from clothing to cookware. PFAS break down very slowly in the environment, allowing them to accumulate in the environment, most worryingly in soil and drinking water sources. PFAS have been linked to negative health outcomes such as cholesterol increases, lower birth weight, reduced immune response, fertility issues, and kidney, prostate, and testicular cancers.

The EPA has continued its emphasis on addressing the contamination of natural environments by these chemical substances. Proposed efforts under Administrator Zeldin in late April, including the formation of an agency focused on PFAS, the creation of effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) to prevent them from entering drinking water systems, the strengthening of cleanup efforts in water supplies impacted by PFAS contamination, and procedures for holding polluters accountable through investigations and liability frameworks. A complete list of proposed EPA actions for combatting PFAS contamination can be found here.

The Trump EPA also partially rolled back Biden-era PFAS drinking water limits. While the EPA has maintained limits on PFOA and PFOS, enforcement is delayed until 2031. Additionally, the agency removed and weakened regulations on other forms of PFAS on May 14. Specifically, the EPA “is also announcing its intent to rescind the regulations and reconsider the regulatory determinations for” PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA. The MCL for those PFAS had been set at 10 ppt. The EPA will also do away with a hazard index that would measure and regulate those three PFAS plus PFBS collectively even if their individual concentrations were not above 10 ppt. These changes are likely to see legal challenges because of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “no backsliding” provision preventing EPA from weakening its rules. Separately, the Trump EPA has been granted more time to decide whether it wants to defend the Biden-era rules in court cases dating back to before the Trump administration began. The latest extension runs out in late July. Regardless of that decision, the court will still need to rule on the legality of the rule, though more delays could come.

A ProPublica investigation has also revealed that the EPA has cancelled grants for research into PFAS. This comes in direct conflict with the EPA of Trump’s first term which stressed the importance of understanding forever chemicals and their effects on the environment. It also conflicts with claims made by Administrator Zeldin in April that the EPA will go through great lengths to ensure air, land, and water are clean from PFAS. Grant cancellations combined with potential cuts to the agency’s budget could undermine the EPA’s ability to protect Americans from PFAS.

Regulatory Rollbacks

Last updated: July 1, 2025

Perhaps the most prominent and consequential of the Trump administration’s government efforts is its regulatory rollbacks. Under the leadership of Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has focused much of its attention on repealing and reducing regulations, and cutting spending deemed “wasteful,” including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice programs.

In early February, Zeldin announced the agency’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative, consisting of five pillars to guide the EPA’s work. Of these, pillars 2, 3, and 5 focus on regulatory rollbacks. Pillar 2 aims to “restore American energy dominance,” language echoing Trump’s campaign promise to maximize petroleum and gas as key energy sources. Pillar 3 aims to stimulate investment by streamlining permit processes. Finally, pillar 5 focuses on bringing back American auto jobs, and calls for the streamlining and development of “smart regulations” that may loosen environmental protections. This pillar also takes aim at Biden-era policies designed to reduce emissions from gas-powered cars. These regulatory cuts once again exemplify the current administration’s dissonant policy approach, as it permits environmentally destructive practices on one hand while claiming to support clean air and water on the other.

March 12 was what Zeldin called “the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history” for the EPA. Administrator Zeldin announced the rollback of 31 Biden era actions ranging in focus from electric vehicles to air pollution. Many of these were reconsiderations or revisions of major regulations, including regulatory flexibility for oil and gas wastewater usage and reviewing wastewater regulations for coal burning power plants. It also included attempts to scrap the Clean Power Plan 2.0 regulation that would require all coal plants and new natural gas plants to use carbon capture technology to capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032 if they planned to be operational in 2040. Three rules that focused on setting stricter standards for gas-powered cars and encouraging emissions reductions technologies are also under review.

Zeldin also announced a review of the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS) after the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. United States to limit the bodies of water that the EPA has jurisdiction over. Particularly, the Court found in Sackett that wetlands without “a continuous surface connection to bodies of water of the United States in their own right,” are not covered. The Biden EPA rewrote the rule in 2023 to comply with Sackett while maintaining the administration’s priorities around clean water protections, though conservatives charged that the rule was unclear and did not properly implement the ruling. The EPA wants to ensure the revised rule “follows the law, reduces red-tape, cuts overall permitting costs, and lowers the cost of doing business in communities across the country while protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution,” the agency wrote in a press release.

Significantly, the EPA will embark on “a formal reconsideration” of the 2009 endangerment finding. This finding was an EPA determination based on the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as a public health hazard. The attempt to reverse this finding, which will invite legal challenges, could unravel all of EPA’s existing climate regulations and prevent the agency from imposing regulations in the future.

In June, EPA Administrator Zeldin announced two proposals to “restore American energy dominance.” The first plan proposes repealing “all greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act.” More specifically, this means the emission guidelines for existing power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration/storage-based requirements for new combustion turbines and modified coal plants. The EPA claims this proposal would ensure reliable energy supplies and drive down costs in manufacturing, farming, transportation, heating, and utilities. The Biden EPA claimed that the rules would limit pollution “without disrupting the delivery of reliable electricity,” and would provide annualized net benefits of $19 billion per year. The second plan proposes repealing amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) that limited emissions from coal-fired power plants. The EPA touts that a reversal would save roughly $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade, though when the amendments were originally announced, the agency estimated that enacting the stricter MATS standards would save $24 billion per year. MATS has been highly effective in protecting public health and the environment, having decreased mercury emissions by 86 percent, acid gas hazardous air pollutants by 96 percent and non-mercury metals by 81 percent between 2010 and 2017. Administrator Zeldin argues that these facilities contribute little to climate pollution globally and that regulations are only harming Americans via the price of lower energy production capacity.

Employee Firings and Office Closures

Last updated: July 1, 2025

The Trump Administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has removed federal employees en masse. In February, nearly 25,000 probationary federal employees were laid off, including 419 at the EPA. These employees have fewer civil service protections than other federal employees and have been at their job for one or two years or fewer. This does not necessarily mean that these employees are inexperienced; on the contrary, among the firings are longtime employees who were recently promoted, putting them on probationary status. Probationary employees were reinstated in mid-March as a result of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by a federal judge in Maryland. However, by mid-April the administration resumed these firings after a preliminary injunction in Maryland was struck down and another in California was invalidated. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has emphasized goals for staff totals to return to levels last seen under former President Ronald Reagan, although has not communicated concrete employment goals.

Documents reviewed by Democratic staff on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology reveal EPA plans to lay off as many as 1,155 scientists, 75% of the agency’s research staff. These plans also included calls to dissolve the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, which, as of March, had 1,540 positions. Remaining staff are to be reassigned to other agency offices “to provide increased oversight and align with administration priorities.” For the Great Lakes region, this may significantly impact EPA labs in Cincinnati and Duluth. The Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center in Cincinnati is the second largest in the US and 7.7.17.pdf"">employs hundreds of individuals in the Greater Cincinnati area while providing the research basis for many decisions that keep ecosystems and humans healthy and safe from environmental pollutants. The Great Lakes Toxicology and Ecology Division (GTLED) Lab in Duluth employs over 130 scientists, contributes over $15 million to the economy, and is vital in keeping Lake Superior clean and healthy. Minnesota Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN) have 94.2025.04.02-zeldin-letter-ajk-edits-template-clean-final.pdf"">written to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to express their concerns and call on him to protect the GTLED Lab. Amid these firings, however, the EPA also announced the hiring of at least 130 scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) with the goal of working on the backlogs of over 504 chemicals and over 12,000 pesticides needing review.

In carrying out the Trump administration’s executive order calling for an end to government diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, the EPA announced the termination of the agency’s DEI and environmental justice arms. To carry out such action, the EPA began a Reduction in Force (RIF) for approximately 280 DEI and environmental justice employees. Additionally, the EPA is in the process of dismantling its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights. This included placing 11 employees in DEI and 160 in environmental justice roles on administrative leave. Administrator Zeldin also intends to reorganize and eliminate offices of environmental justice at all 10 EPA regional offices and the agency’s DC office. These offices address the disproportionate levels of pollution and contamination affecting low-income and minority communities, and their closures would end much of the work aimed at reducing the burden of environmental injustices.

The President’s Budget

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines.
And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.
“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email.
Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.","President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday that he said will “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources” such as wind and solar.

But it’s not clear whether the order will have much of an effect other than to underscore the president’s antipathy for those power sources. Some observers speculate this action is fulfilling a promise to hardline conservative House members in order to win their votes last week for the massive budget reconciliation bill.

The order is titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.” It directs the Treasury department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits” as specified by the bill.

The legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, says that projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027. This is a rapid phaseout compared to the previous law that had a phaseout that was to begin in 2032.

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines. It also says the department must take prompt action to follow the bill’s new limits on tax credits going to entities with ties to China.

In addition, it says the Department of the Interior must revise any policies or practices that give solar and wind power preferential treatment compared to other energy sources.

The Treasury and Interior departments also must make reports within 45 days about how they are complying with the order.

Analysts, lawmakers and officials from renewable energy industry groups had mixed reactions about the significance of the order.

But they do not downplay the effects of the bill that has become law. It is a gutting of incentives from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that will reduce federal government support for renewable energy, electric vehicles and manufacturing of those products and related components. The result, according to reports from Rhodium Group, Princeton University’s REPEAT Project, the think tank Energy Innovation and the Clean Energy Buyers Association, is likely to be a decrease in U.S. jobs and an increase in electricity prices.

And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.

“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email. “To state the obvious, only Congress can change tax law—which, in fact, is what Congress did last week via the budgetary megabill.”

He expects little or no practical effect from the Interior department provision

“It is worth noting that, under the Federal Power Act, the government cannot favor one type of power generation over another,” he said. “Thus, the EO simply restates existing law in that regard.”

Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate for BloombergNEF, sees much greater potential for harm to the wind and solar industries.

“It’s a big deal, but how big a deal it is we don’t know,” he said.

He explained that the order is attempting to create uncertainty around the 2026 deadline, which is a crucial deadline for projects to have a smooth path to qualifying for tax credits.

“It could push a lot of projects out of eligibility or into such an uncertain state of eligibility that it becomes hard to build and finance them,” he said.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, offered this statement:

“This executive order appears to target long-standing and well-established tax standards that allow for realistic financing timelines for all sorts of energy projects—including solar, wind, carbon capture and hydrogen projects,” she said. “We will continue to make the case that business certainty, predictability, and even-handedness are bedrocks of federal policy that cannot be undone by the stroke of a pen. We expect the Treasury Department to follow the law.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois), who has a background running clean energy businesses, said the order is about helping the market for fossil fuels by harming competing sources of electricity.

“Donald Trump doesn’t hate renewable energy because it is clean,” he said in an email. “He hates it because it’s cheap. His latest executive orders are about making it harder for Americans to access cheap and reliable energy to ensure he keeps profits up for his friends in the fossil fuel industry.”

Taylor Rogers, an assistant press secretary for Trump, pushed back on concerns that the president’s actions would lead to higher energy prices.

“No one takes disingenuous cost concerns seriously from ‘clean energy’ groups that supported a $200 billion tax hike on the American people to fund the Green New Scam,” she said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill will continue to unleash America’s energy industry, dropping electricity costs that increased dramatically due to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.”

She listed the many aspects of the bill that increase oil and gas production and reduce regulations, which she said will cut costs for consumers.

Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.

The budget bill passed the House on Friday, 218-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. Several fiscally conservative House members initially balked at the spending levels in the bill, but most of them ended up voting for it after meeting with Trump.

Asked about how Trump had earned their votes, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told CNBC on Friday that the president had told members he would use executive powers to stop renewable energy sources from being able to use subsidies.

“A lot of these subsidies won’t remain in effect from here on out,” Norman said.

He posted on Facebook on Tuesday that the order was “a pledge [Trump] had made, and one he kept.”

He added, “I proudly support an all-of-the-above energy approach—ensuring coal, gas, nuclear, hydropower, and yes, responsibly advanced renewables can compete in an honest market. THIS is how you make energy policy work for everyday Americans, not special interests.”

It’s not much of a stretch to see a connection between Norman’s comment on CNBC and the executive order, said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that works to expand access to rooftop solar.

“I assume that this is the direct response to that promise,” he said.

He said it’s difficult to predict the ramifications of the order without knowing how federal agencies will choose to respond.

“It all depends on how Treasury interprets the guidance. It could be nothing. It could be a lot,” he said.

Brand believes the order’s intent was to increase uncertainty and discourage companies from using the tax credits, which it may succeed in doing even if it doesn’t lead to any substantive changes in the way the credits work.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2198226868-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:28.683263

It’s unclear how much demand there is for new development.

New coal leasing in the nation’s top producing coal region has been under a moratorium imposed by the Biden administration late last year, largely based on its contribution to climate change. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) adopted that wording to resource management plans for its Buffalo and Miles City field offices in late November. The agency estimated existing mining activity would dry up by the end of 2040.

Shortly after in December, Montana and Wyoming sued. Industry leaders and Wyoming politicians have voiced that they think the BLM’s November decision was an attack on Wyoming’s top money maker.

Then in April, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) held up a sparkly, black rock before his fellow lawmakers.

“This is Wyoming coal,” he said. “We need more of it, not less of it to power our nation.”

That belief was echoed in several of Pres. Trump’s executive orders, including some signed in April.

“It’s part of this bold plan the administration has to restore American energy dominance,” said Barrasso.

Those orders are helping to amend the BLM’s Powder River Basin resource plans. The agency announced this week it’s considering reopening coal leasing, specifically tying the choice to Trump’s plan for “Unleashing American Energy.”

The BLM’s official notice of intent document was published July 8. It outlines two options for the future amendment. The first action is a no action/current decision, which would keep the area closed to new coal leasing. The second option is the “proposed action,” which would open the 1,214,380 acres “for further consideration for coal leasing.” The public has until August 7th to weigh in.

A 30-day public comment period for this type of plan amendment is “not normal,” according to conservation group Earthjustice. They added that prior to this, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations required 45 days. However, the Trump administration is dismantling the federal act, which was signed into law in 1970. It intended to protect the environment as much as possible and involved the public along the way.

A White House press release said they’re streamlining the act to “simplify this overly burdensome process and ensure efficient and timely environmental reviews.” This is also in support of the administration’s plan to Unleash American Energy.

“We will end the government bias against coal and we’re going to unlock the Defense Production Act to turbo charge coal mining in America,” Trump said in an April press conference where he signed several executive orders. “They made it impossible.”

Trump said Democrats have hampered the coal industry. However, coal has continued to decline under both Republican and Democratic presidents, including during Trump’s first presidency.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b8a6a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd9%2F45%2F0e03f3274348bc8e3045734de79d%2Fcoal-powder-river-basin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:17:04.817799

But the other thing is, if you have a bad front trunk experience, which could be both [that] its very small, or you don't have cinching, meaning you have to push, like if you've had a rear-engine car like a Porsche, it's always very weird to push down in the hood. You do it, and you can feel the hood bow a little bit every time you do it, and the whole experience makes you feel like, ""I don't want to do that."" And in R1, it powers up [and] powers down, so it's very different. In R2, it doesn't power down, but it cinches. You just get it close enough, and it pulls it in. But not having to push on a Class A surface, we think, is a big deal.

And even with, like, I've owned multiple Teslas, I'd say it's one of the things that deterred me from using the front trunk on my Model Y, that I never went to dent the hood, pushing them. But the data for us has been very compelling.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/automakers-that-claim-owners-dont-use-ev-frunks-are-probably-lying-or-just-make-bad-frunks-says-rivian-ceo-rj-scaringe/l-intro-1752001044.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:14:09.197130

Planet Detroit’s Voices column includes opinion pieces from our community of partners and readers.","Detroit is facing extreme heat. Last month, it was unhealthy air quality due to wildfire smoke layered onto local pollution. Over the winter, an entire neighborhood suffered the effects of a cold snap coupled with severe water infrastructure failure.

In Detroit, we are constantly preparing for storms on both political and climate fronts as we weather increasingly devastating levels of rainfall amidst decades of disinvestment, overwhelming our infrastructure and flooding our basements and streets.

Additionally, forceful storms and extreme heat interact with heavy industry and outdated systems to exacerbate the financial and health impacts of weather emergencies, according to The New York Times. Here, as elsewhere, we see the strength of unanticipated storms impacting generations to come.

With the current presidential administration, those of us invested in community development and climate planning are already underwater from the impacts of a new era of scarce federal support as Trump’s team slashes funding, dismisses climate crises, and belittles communities most at risk.

In this critical absence of federal resources, which exacerbates preexisting inadequacies and insufficient oversight, Detroit and other American cities must embrace a hyperlocal approach to climate adaptation that supports neighborhood health and wellness.

Community-led strategies must drive neighborhood climate response, meeting immediate needs and in turn informing local policy measures and resource distribution.

Local expertise and resident networks are critical to climate response. I say this as a community-engaged architect and planner with years of experience addressing climate issues at the local level and working alongside residents to elevate community voices in the decision-making that impacts their neighborhoods.

Detroit stormwater project, resilience hubs highlight community climate response

In the last two decades, I have worked with community design practices in the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Lower Rio Grande Valley, and Detroit to design spaces and develop adaptive strategies that leverage local assets, respond to the environment, and prepare for the next storm.

These resident-driven design and planning solutions lead to more responsive, grounded and equitable climate action, which ought to inform top-down decisions tied to relief resources and infrastructure investment.

On Detroit’s east side, community leaders have envisioned green stormwater infrastructure that manages heavy rains via planted landscapes and meets multiple local needs including land stabilization and beautification as well as flood reduction tied to climate change and aging infrastructure. This work proposes an alternative to pricey underground water infrastructure while pushing for policy change that would enable community-level landscape solutions.

More recently, neighborhood organizations and resident leaders have launched a network of resilience hubs that serve Detroiters in times of climate emergency. The resilience hubs leverage social networks and a dispersed infrastructure of existing, trusted community spaces across the eastside.

Philanthropy and city staff committed to community sustainability are supporting and enabling these efforts. Simultaneously, community groups are urgently advocating for reliable regulation that will ensure healthy water, air, and infrastructure for the city’s next generation. Much of this work is led by the highly engaged and productive Eastside Community Network, and other allied groups.

Both grassroots and policy solutions needed to weather climate change

Critically, social networks strengthen the local infrastructure that supports community resilience. The importance of social capital in disaster response is well documented as the single-most impactful element in recovery (see the work of Daniel Aldrich).

The community-led processes and spaces that are alive and well in Detroit reinforce place-based networks that build community connections. Along these lines, the MIT Healthy Neighborhoods Study emphasizes that “when it comes to building healthy communities it’s not just what is built, but the sense of power, control, and direct benefit that residents of those communities have over what is built that matters for health,” making the case for increased community input in planning for climate infrastructure for health outcomes at the local level.

Without a doubt, to meet increasing need and adequately support communities to prepare, adapt and respond to climate emergencies, solutions must operate at both the grassroots and policy level. Climate strategies must balance professional and community expertise and integrate infrastructure systems with fine-grained interventions.

Community networks with local knowledge and lived experience are best positioned to respond in times of crisis and are integral to local action that ought to drive policy decisions. And in the absence of climate leadership at the federal level under Trump, we must act locally, as poignantly called for by climate activist and author Ayana Elizabeth Johnson.

Community engagement in infrastructure planning and climate response that derives from the hyperlocal context is imperative to build equitable systems and policies that work.

Residents should not have to advocate to be heard, or for their own health and safety, as they seek to weather storms caused by climate change. The recognition of and support for community expertise and strategies will more effectively and equitably meet local needs during climate catastrophes and result in exponential and tangible benefits with citywide implications.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-07-08 19:05:13+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Controversial Ford battery plant 'on track' to remain eligible for key federal support,The Detroit News,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/08/ford-battery-plant/,"WASHINGTON — Ford Motor Co. confirmed Tuesday that its multibillion-dollar battery plant in south-central Michigan remains “on track” to qualify for a crucial federal tax credit, despite new federal restrictions on sourcing from China.
The credit in question, also known as the 45X credit, targets battery producers and upstream industries.
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford originally said ineligibility of the production tax credit would “imperil” the $3 billion plant expected to create 1,700 jobs.
The executives underscored that if EVs are going to be affordable, the company needs the advanced Chinese battery technology, and if it cannot build those cells economically in the United States, it will have to source from elsewhere.
Detroit-based General Motors Co. plans to do so, as well, until it can domestically produce lithium manganese-rich batteries, a technology Ford also is developing.","WASHINGTON — Ford Motor Co. confirmed Tuesday that its multibillion-dollar battery plant in south-central Michigan remains “on track” to qualify for a crucial federal tax credit, despite new federal restrictions on sourcing from China.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” company spokesperson Robyn Jackson said in a statement. “BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit — a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

The Marshall, Michigan, plant has been controversial because of Ford’s agreement to license technology from Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. at the new facility, an arrangement that sparked backlash and threatened business plans with some 60% of construction complete.

The new federal restrictions came via Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive tax cut and spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend. An earlier U.S. House version of the bill would have torpedoed Ford’s eligibility for the federal Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, but an all-out lobbying effort helped the Dearborn-based automaker secure favorable changes in the U.S. Senate.

The credit in question, also known as the 45X credit, targets battery producers and upstream industries. Battery cells, which store and release energy needed to power EVs, are each eligible for a credit of $35 per kilowatt-hour of energy they can store and $10 per kilowatt-hour for battery modules or pack assembly. The Marshall plant’s capacity is 20 gigawatt-hours per year.

Ford’s company statement uses careful language to describe its tax credit status, as the U.S. Department of the Treasury still needs to finalize implementation guidelines based on the congressional directive. Those guidelines will more firmly determine the plant’s eligibility.

Ford CEO Jim Farley has called the credit “critical for our industry,” but the House bill explicitly excluded components made as a product of licensing agreements with prohibited foreign entities — a designation that applies to CATL. The final Senate version removed that language.

Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford originally said ineligibility of the production tax credit would “imperil” the $3 billion plant expected to create 1,700 jobs. Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems, later clarified that the automaker planned to “stick behind” Marshall, but said losing the credit could delay production and hiring.

The executives underscored that if EVs are going to be affordable, the company needs the advanced Chinese battery technology, and if it cannot build those cells economically in the United States, it will have to source from elsewhere.

Renewable Energy Batteries The new law requires that any renewable energy storage facility obtain a permit from LDENR prior to battery installation.","Louisiana has a new renewable energy law on the books, Act No. 279, set to take effect on August 1, 2025. It provides for the regulation of solar facilities, renewable energy batteries, and onshore wind projects, all under the permitting authority of the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR). The solar facility piece of the legislation comes in response to several parishes grappling with recent divisions over large-scale solar project proposals. Act No. 279 is notable in that it grants the state permitting authority and mandates solar project siting requirements, yet it carves out an exception whereby parish governments may elect to impose their own, potentially more restrictive, siting requirements. A summary of the new requirements for each renewable energy category is as follows.

Solar Facilities

Any solar power generation project with a footprint of 75 acres or more must obtain a permit from LDENR. In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries may weigh in and comment on the project permit.

The new law also contains siting requirements related to setbacks and noise levels that apply to solar facilities with a footprint of 75 acres or more and that begin construction after January 1, 2026. However, there are notable exceptions to these siting requirements:

Parish governments that create their own siting requirements can opt out of the state siting requirements.

Facilities located completely within an industrial-zoned area or a Louisiana Economic Development-certified site are excepted from the siting requirements.

Residential property owners may opt out of certain siting requirements under a written agreement with the solar project’s operator.

The new law’s setback requirements are generally 300-feet from adjacent residential property lines; 100-feet from the ordinary low watermark of natural and navigable waterways; and 50-feet from the edge of public roads. Additional vegetative barrier requirements were also adopted. In addition, the act prohibits noise levels greater than 10 A-weighted decibels (dbA) above the pre-project operation ambient noise level at the project’s property line.

Renewable Energy Batteries

The new law requires that any renewable energy storage facility obtain a permit from LDENR prior to battery installation. Proof of financial security and a decommissioning plan are also required. LDENR has been directed to promulgate rules to implement these requirements by August 31, 2026.

Onshore Wind Energy

The new law prohibits the construction or completion of any onshore wind project without a permit from LDENR. Proof of financial security and a decommissioning plan are required as part of the permitting process. LDENR has been directed to promulgate rules to implement these requirements by August 31, 2026.

You talk about how one of the challenges in the EV industry is that consumers only have a few choices for a sub-$50,000 EV, e.g., the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y.
You're going to see these big networks emerge in much the same way that gas station and that infrastructure was built out.
Having more companies focused on the US auto industry would be much better for the US auto industry, much better for the US as a country, and certainly better for my kids.","Much has changed for the EV industry in the past half-decade, let alone in the 16 years since Rivian, the California-based electric vehicle maker, was founded.

Legacy automakers, from GM to Volkswagen, have begun to build out their EV platforms. The Biden administration introduced unique measures to supercharge EV adoption, and China has emerged as a dominant electric vehicle player.

Yet, EVs remain a brutal business.

Sales have slowed worldwide. Tesla and Rivian are two of the few all-electric US automakers with any skin in the game, and the second Trump administration has moved to put the previous administration's EV push to a screeching halt.

The Big Beautiful Bill, which cuts EV tax credits introduced by the Biden administration, was signed into law on July 4.

Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, has maintained that the EV credits will have minimal impact on his company. However, the CEO recently told reporters that the current administration's posture could be bad for the overall US auto industry.

""I think that the move away from some of the tailwinds that were previously in place for electric vehicles is actually good for Rivian, it's good for Tesla, it's bad for the US auto industry, and it's bad for my kids,"" he said.

Rivian invited media outlets to preview the company's latest quad-motor platform for its second-generation R1 truck and SUV, which is priced from $116,000 to $126,000, in South Lake Tahoe, California.

During a roundtable interview on June 25, Business Insider asked Scaringe for his thoughts on Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, what hurdles lie ahead for the industry, and why Rivian wants to produce a $120,000 truck and SUV as average consumers look for cheaper vehicle options.

The following, which only includes questions from Business Insider, was edited for length and clarity.

You talk about how one of the challenges in the EV industry is that consumers only have a few choices for a sub-$50,000 EV, e.g., the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. Where does a $120K quad-motor vehicle fit into that equation?

Well, the quad is a flagship powertrain and a flagship vehicle. It's great for the brand, but it's sort of an exercise in unnecessary capability. It's so quick, it's so capable off-road. The torque factoring characteristics are remarkable and it's well beyond what one would need, but it's great for building awareness and brand. There are a lot of customers, particularly R1 customers, that just want the best of what we can make. And so it's for that customer.

But it's not a high-volume product, whereas R2, with a starting price of $45,000, will be very, very high volume. It's a totally different customer demographic and totally different trade-offs we have to make at the product level, but it needs to feel cohesive and consistent with the brand and the way we approach solving the technical problems in the vehicle.

Rivian is unveiling a lot of features in the quad, like the real auto dynamics tuner. I'm curious when you look at what the Jeff Bezos-backed Slate company is doing with a simple, bare-bones truck and the general direction of the market — I'm curious if you see that and think, ""Do we need all this? Do we need all these fun features?""

Again, I think it's awesome that there are different teams of people that come up with different answers to the question of how you design a car. So we're obviously building a software-forward vehicle. It's very tech-forward. The existence of a concept like Slate, of course, doesn't challenge our perception of how we're approaching inserting technology and having a really software-rich environment. But they're going to go for a different customer, and the market needs lots of choices. So I think it's good to see that.

On the way up, I spoke with a Rivian owner who said the biggest barrier for her right now is finding an available fast-charging station. We've been talking about EVs for decades. Here, we have a very capable EV car, but we're still dealing with basic things like finding a working charging station. How do you react to that?

I 100% agree. If you'd asked me six or seven years ago, I would've said emphatically that charging is going to get built out. You're going to see private investments flow into it. You're going to see these big networks emerge in much the same way that gas station and that infrastructure was built out. We went from zero gas stations to 100,000 gas stations in like 10 years. Today, there are about 160,000 gas stations in the United States.

But charging stations have been woefully underinvested in such that you have one dominant strong network with Tesla. It's a great network, with outstanding performance and high uptime. We've partnered with them to allow access to version three or newer chargers. But outside that, all the networks are really, honestly quite awful because the uptime is terrible. So you go to a charging location, and you expect it to work, but two of the three chargers, or four of the six, don't work. You have to queue for the ones that are working. Because of that, we decided to build our own network as well — something we call the Rivian Adventure Network (RAN).

It's small. I mean, it's 4% the size of Tesla's network, but it's growing rapidly. And importantly, it's one of two networks in the United States that have uptime north of 99% — obviously, Tesla being the other.

We designed all the hardware ourselves and then built it all ourselves. We build it all in our plants in Normal, Illinois. And so we're going to be continuing to build that. And again, I never would've imagined we'd be building one of the strongest networks in the United States. I didn't think we'd need to do that. But as it's playing out, I think there's going to be far fewer networks than we ever expected. Today, I'd say there are two networks that are great if the metric is uptime. There are maybe four or five networks that have more than, call it, 600 or 700 chargers. But it's really, really underbuilt. And so we're actively building that out. New RAN stations are popping up, a couple every week. So it's a big focus for us and a huge spend category for us as well.

The current administration is a little more hostile to EVs. We have the Big Beautiful Bill, for example. Mike Murphy, a GOP operative and CEO of the EV Politics Project, told The New York Times that the bill was a ""big win for China and bad for American manufacturing."" Do you share that sentiment?

I agree. I think that policy changes, in the end, don't change anything. We're going to electrify. And it's really important the United States continues to lead there, and I think that the move away from some of the tailwinds that were previously in place for electric vehicles is actually good for Rivian, it's good for Tesla, it's bad for the US auto industry, and it's bad for my kids.

Having more companies focused on the US auto industry would be much better for the US auto industry, much better for the US as a country, and certainly better for my kids.

We're basically on an island fighting all the other OEMs. They would never say this publicly, because publicly they're pro-EVs — but the biggest adversaries against electrification are big OEMs. So we fight that hard. It's so frustrating to see companies talk out of both sides of their mouth when they say they're pro-electrification, but they're just gloves off on the policy side. So anti-EV. I think the challenge is, in the short term, that will maximize profits; in the long term, when you have a completely different set of leaders in place in the 2030s, it's going to be really challenging for these companies that under-invest in this space.",https://i.insider.com/6869f230f748d8c055f507a8?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:07.367346

Background

In December 2024, the Biden Administration’s Department of Energy (DOE) published a long-awaited update to the agency’s analysis of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The multi-volume analysis, termed the 2024 LNG Export Study, represents the most comprehensive government assessment to-date of the energy, economic, and environmental impacts of U.S. LNG exports.

Key findings

Major proposed LNG projects would fail to achieve the “climate neutrality” benchmark put forward by a 2024 federal analysis (“2024 LNG Study”) to inform the review of LNG export applications under the Natural Gas Act.

As a result, pending LNG export applications appear to be inconsistent with the U.S. public interest and would drive up global greenhouse gas emissions. This finding is robust across policy/technology assumptions that the U.S. government included in the 2024 LNG Study.

Even if major steps were taken to clean up the gas supply chain, U.S. exports would be inconsistent with the 1.5ºC climate goal. This is because LNG expansion drives up energy demand and displaces renewable energy in importing markets, according to the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) that underlies the government study.

LNG projects are a risky investment. They take years to build and decades to pay off, and the Natural Gas Act authorizes the U.S. government to rescind export authorizations that are deemed inconsistent with the public interest.

LNG expansion harms communities and working families. The massive growth in LNG infrastructure along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast is already having significant public health impacts, and threatening coastal communities and ecosystems in the process.

termination of 7 clean energy tax credits in 2025 or 2026

On July 7, 2025, the President issued a related Executive Order (the “BOC Order”) regarding the rapid termination of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar. This client update will focus on the effect of the BBBA and the BOC Order on clean energy tax incentives. For our coverage of the general business tax provisions of the BBBA, click here.

1. Revision to the ITC and PTC

A. Rapid Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Wind and Solar

The eligibility of wind and solar projects for the ITC and PTC is being phased out rapidly. To be eligible for either credit, the wind or solar facility must either

begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA), or

be placed in service prior to January 1, 2028.

B. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Existing IRS guidance provides liberal rules for determining when construction begins for purposes of ITC and PTC phaseouts. Under the existing IRS guidance, a taxpayer can begin construction (“BOC”) by commencing physical work on the project (including certain off-site work on a component of the project) or incurring 5% of the cost of equipment for the project. Under a safe harbor in the existing IRS guidance, a project that begins construction in 2026 can be placed in service as late as December 31, 2030, or in some circumstances even later. However, unlike the beginning of construction principles applicable under the FEOC rules (discussed below), the applicable IRS guidance is not statutorily frozen as of January 1, 2025.

The BOC Order directs that “[w]ithin 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

It seems likely that the new IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order will be more restrictive than existing IRS guidance. The scope and effective date of the new guidance is unknown.

C. Accelerated Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Other Technologies

For technologies other than wind and solar, the BBBA accelerates the phaseout of the ITC and PTC by eliminating the prong of the phaseout that was based upon the year that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall to 25% of 2022 levels. As a result, such projects that begin construction before 2034 will generally be entitled to the full ITC or PTC rate, but those rates will drop to 75% for construction begun in 2034, 50% for construction begun in 2035, and 0% thereafter. The scope of the BOC Order is limited to the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar, so it is not clear to what extent any IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order might apply to other technologies or for other purposes of the ITC or PTC (including, for example, the domestic content or energy community adders).

D. Increased Domestic Content Requirement to Qualify for ITC Adder

Under prior law, the level of domestic content required to qualify for the domestic content adder for the ITC was permanently set at 40% (or 20% for offshore wind), while the percentage required to qualify for the PTC version of the adder increased over time. Under the BBBA, property that began construction before June 16, 2025 will continue to require 40% domestic content; however, projects beginning construction in 2025 after June 16, in 2026, or in a later year must consist of 45%, 50%, or 55% U.S. components, respectively, to qualify for the domestic content adder. These required percentages are lower (20%, 27.5%, and 35%) for offshore wind facilities beginning construction before 2027, then 55% thereafter.

E. PTC Adder for Nuclear Energy Communities

The BBBA expands the energy community credit adder to apply to certain advanced nuclear facilities that claim the PTC, but not to any such facilities that claim the ITC. An “advanced nuclear facility” is defined as any nuclear facility for which either the reactor design was approved after December 31, 1993, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and such a design or a substantially similar one was not approved before such date, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction and issued a site-specific construction permit or combined license. To qualify for the energy community bonus credit on this basis, the advanced nuclear facility must be located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or at any time after December 31, 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power.

F. Leased Systems Formerly Eligible for Section 25D Credit for Solar Water Heating or Wind

The BBBA disallows the ITC and PTC for solar heating property and wind property that qualifies for the homeowner’s credit under section 25D, as in effect prior to its repeal by the BBBA. This disallowance is limited to property that is leased to the homeowner. An earlier version of the BBBA would have extended this disallowance to leased rooftop solar systems, but that provision was not included in the bill as enacted.

G. ITC for Fuel Cells

The BBBA creates a 30% ITC specifically for qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after 2025. This credit is not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but it also does not benefit from other ITC adders. Fuel cells had previously struggled to qualify for the ITC after revisions in the IRA required property for which the credit is claimed to have an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate of no greater than zero. Under the BBBA, fuel cells qualify for the full 30% ITC regardless of technology, fuel type, or greenhouse gas emission profile.

2. Transferability (Sale) of Credits

Section 6418, allowing transfers (sales) of tax credits, has been revised to disallow the transfer of most clean energy tax credits to any entity that is a specified foreign entity (see the discussion of the FEOC rules below). This is an improvement over earlier versions of the bill that would have more broadly phased out the ability to transfer credits.

3. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

A. Phaseout of Credit for Applicable Critical Minerals

Under prior law, the section 45X manufacturing credit for applicable critical minerals had no expiration date. The BBBA adds a phaseout that starts one year later than the pre-existing phaseout for other section 45X eligible components. The full credit rate is available for applicable critical minerals sold before 2031. Applicable critical minerals sold in 2031, 2032, or 2033 will be eligible for 75%, 50%, or 25% respectively of the currently allowable credit. Applicable critical minerals sold after 2033 will not qualify for a credit.

B. New Applicable Critical Mineral Category: Metallurgical Coal

The BBBA creates a separate category of applicable critical minerals for metallurgical coal, defined as coal suitable for use in the production of steel within the meaning of guidance published by the Department of Energy. Metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030, will qualify for a credit of 2.5% of the relevant production costs.

C. Changes to Rules Regarding Other Eligible Components

The credit for production of wind energy components will not apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The phase-out for other eligible components is unchanged.

An additional requirement was added for a component to qualify for the $10 credit for battery modules. The module must be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and battery harnesses, or other essential energy collection equipment.”

D. Reduced Scope of Integrated Component Rule

The BBBA modifies the rule that deems one or more eligible components to be sold to an unrelated person (as required to qualify for the credit) if such eligible components are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into another eligible component that is produced and sold to an unrelated person. Under the BBBA, the integration, incorporation, or assembly into the second eligible component must occur in the same manufacturing facility, at least 65% of the direct materials costs for the second eligible component must be for components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and the credit is unavailable if the second component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a third component. This rule applies to components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

4. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

The credit for carbon capture and sequestration was largely untouched by the BBBA and, in one respect, was significantly enhanced: the credit amount per ton of captured carbon oxide that is used in enhanced oil or gas recovery or for other commercial purposes, such as food and beverage, was increased from the current rate of $60 per ton to $85 per ton, the rate that was previously available only for carbon oxide disposed of by sequestration. This increase in the credit amount is equally available to carbon oxide captured from industrial emissions or direct air capture. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025; carbon capture projects already placed in service would not be able to claim the higher credit amounts for these uses. The requirement that construction of carbon capture projects begin before January 1, 2033, is unchanged. The FEOC rules also apply to the Section 45Q credit as covered below.

5. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The BBBA extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z to fuel sold through December 31, 2029. However, qualifying fuels produced after December 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Under prior law, there had been a question as to whether certain production processes could be considered to have a negative emissions rate for most fuels by resulting in an enhanced credit amount. The BBBA explicitly rules out application of a negative emissions rate by providing that, for purposes of determining the emissions factor, qualifying fuels may not be treated as having an emissions rate of less than zero. However, the BBBA offers a significant exception to this prohibition in allowing biofuels derived from animal manure (which is the fuel category most commonly assigned a negative emissions rate) to have a negative emissions rate. In a blow to the sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) industry, the BBBA reduces the per gallon credit for SAF from $1.75 to the amount available to other transportation fuels of $1.00, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. As with other credits, these changes are in addition to the limitations under the FEOC rules covered below.

6. Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

The BBBA accelerates the date by which clean hydrogen production projects must begin construction to December 31, 2027. This is considered a win for the sector after earlier versions of the BBBA would have required a 2025 beginning of construction date. The sector also benefits from the continued availability of the investment tax credit for hydrogen storage, compression and liquefaction equipment under section 48E and, as discussed above, the investment tax credit for hydrogen fuel cell property.

7. Termination of Other Clean Energy Credits

The BBBA significantly accelerates the end date for various tax credits relating to the acquisition of clean energy-related property. These credits, and the new applicable end dates, are as follows:

Section 25E Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit—property must be placed in service by December 31, 2025;

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit—expenditures must be incurred by December 31, 2025;

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit—property must be placed in service by June 30, 2026;

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit—home must be purchased by June 30, 2026; and

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction—property must begin construction by June 30, 2026.

8. Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)

With the exception of the Section 45V credit for hydrogen production, all IRA tax credits that survive beyond 2026 are subject to disallowance under new FEOC rules if the taxpayer, facility, or product has impermissible connections to China or other disfavored countries or entities. The FEOC rules may disallow the relevant tax credit to a “specified foreign entity,” a “foreign-influenced entity,” or an entity that receives “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity.” Each of those terms has a complex definition, as described below. The particular rules that apply, and the effective date of those rules, varies from credit to credit, as set forth in the table below.

A. Prohibited Foreign Entities, Specified Foreign Entities, and Foreign-Influenced Entities

1. Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)

A “prohibited foreign entity” (“PFE”) is defined as either a “specified foreign entity” (“SFE”) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (“FIE”).

2. Specified Foreign Entities (SFE)

An SFE is defined as a “foreign-controlled entity” (“FCE”) or an entity designated as a bad actor under certain existing statutes, including designation as a “foreign entity of concern,” a “designated foreign terrorist organization,” or a “Chinese military company operating in the United States.” An FCE is defined as any of (i) the government of a covered nation (including any level of government below the national level and any agency or instrumentality thereof), (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs. A “covered nation” is any of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

3. Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIE)

An entity is an FIE if it satisfies either

a direct control test for the current tax year, or

with respect to the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit, an “effective control” test for the preceding tax year.

Under the direct control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if (i) a single SFE has the direct authority to appoint a board member, executive level officer, or person with similar powers or responsibilities, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs. Special rules apply for determining whether a publicly traded entity is an FIE.

Under the effective control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE pursuant to an agreement that entitles the SFE or a related party to exercise effective control over (i) a facility with respect to which the ITC or PTC may be available or (ii) the production of an “eligible component” under the section 45X manufacturing credit. The statute sets forth thirteen different powers, any one of which alone will constitute “effective control.” These powers generally relate to power over operations or output of a facility, including exclusive control over a critical system within the facility. Six of those specified powers are operative immediately; seven of those specified powers are only relevant to the extent provided in regulations to be issued in the future. The BOC Order directs that “within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

B. Material Assistance Rules for ITC, PTC, and Section 45X Manufacturing Credit

1. General Rules

A taxpayer is not entitled to claim the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit with respect to property with respect to which it receives “material assistance” from a PFE. Whether “material assistance” has been received is determined by comparing the “material assistance cost ratio” for such property to a “threshold percentage.”

The material assistance cost ratio (“Cost Ratio”) of a qualified facility (under the ITC or PTC) or energy storage technology (under the ITC) is the ratio of (i) the total costs attributable to manufactured products (as defined for purposes of the domestic content adder) incorporated upon completion of construction excluding costs of products that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total costs attributable to manufactured products incorporated upon completion of construction. The Cost Ratio for a facility that produces eligible components under the section 45X manufacturing credit is the ratio of (i) the total direct costs that are paid or incurred for the production of an eligible component excluding costs paid or incurred for production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total direct costs paid or incurred for the production of the eligible component.

Threshold percentages are established by statute and vary by the type of property with respect to which a credit is being claimed and the year in which such property begins construction or is sold. Generally, the threshold percentages range from 40% to 95% and increase over time.

The BBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026, which will identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or total direct material costs of any eligible component which are attributable to a PFE and provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s material assistance from a PFE. As noted above, the BOC Order directs Treasury to provide guidance regarding FEOC matters within 45 days of the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA. Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on tables issued in guidance on the domestic content adder (Notice 2025-08) and certifications provided by suppliers under penalty of perjury stating that property or direct material costs were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For purposes of the ITC and PTC, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, for use in a facility that begins construction before August 1, 2025 and is placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities), will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

For purposes of the section 45X manufacturing credit, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and used in a product sold before January 1, 2027 will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

2. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Within the definitions of a PFE and “material assistance,” the BBBA directly incorporates IRS Notice 2013-29 and subsequent related guidance addressing the beginning of construction of a project or facility for tax purposes, as in effect on January 1, 2025. The narrow context (PFE and material assistance) in which the BBBA adopts the BOC principles in effect on January 1, 2025, suggests that this “freeze” of BOC guidance as of January 1, 2025, does not apply in any other context. That appears to be the theory underlying the President’s direction to Treasury in the BOC Order to provide “new and revised” guidance regarding the meaning of “beginning of construction” for purposes of the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar.

3. Penalties and Statute of Limitations

The FEOC rules impose new or harsher penalties relating to the material assistance rule and a longer statute of limitations for IRS examination of material assistance issues.

A taxpayer that claims a credit which is later disallowed due to an IRS adjustment to the Cost Ratio of the underlying property may be liable for a substantial understatement penalty on understatements of tax greater than 1% of the true tax liability, as opposed to the normal 10%.

A supplier who makes a certification under the material assistance rules that it knows or reasonably should have known is false will generally be required to pay a penalty of 10% of the resulting underpayment of tax by its customer.

The period during which the IRS may assess additional tax for an error relating to material assistance from a PFE is extended to six years.

4. ITC Recapture Rule for FEOC Effective Control Payments

A taxpayer will be subject to recapture of 100% of the ITC claimed with respect to a property if within 10 years after the property is placed in service it makes a payment that would be deemed to provide an SFE with “effective control” over the taxpayer as described above. This rule applies to property placed in service in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

5. Summary of Application of FEOC Rules to Surviving Tax Credits

The table below summarizes the applicability of the FEOC rules disallowing tax credits to specified foreign entities, foreign-influenced entities and taxpayers who receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Credit Restrictions on SFEs Restrictions on FIEs Restrictions on Property with Material Assistance from a PFE Section 45Q—Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 45U—Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 45V—Clean Hydrogen Production Credit None None None Section 45X—Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

“Eligible components” do not include any property which includes material assistance from a PFE for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Section 45Y—Clean Electricity Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities do not include any facility the construction of which includes material assistance from a PFE, and which begins construction after December 31, 2025. Section 45Z—Clean Fuel Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 48E—Clean Electricity Investment Credit

No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology do not include property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025, if such construction includes material assistance from a PFE.

In addition to the time pressure to implement begun construction strategies and understand the implications of the FEOC rules, the BBBA creates a number of significant changes to existing tax credits, as well as adding new uncertainties for credit qualification, which may affect tax equity and transferability strategies. We at Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in these and other clean energy tax incentive matters.

The following is a summary of some of the key provisions from the BBBA:

BUSINESS TAX PROVISIONS

Some of the key provisions impacting businesses include the following:

1. Extension of Deduction for Qualified Business Income, REIT Dividends and MLP Income. Under pre-BBBA law, an individual generally may deduct 20 percent of qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship, as well as 20 percent of certain real estate investment trust dividends and publicly traded partnership income. For taxpayers with taxable income in excess of certain specified threshold amounts, the deduction for qualified business income is in most cases limited based on (1) the W-2 wages and unadjusted basis of tangible, depreciable property of each relevant business and (2) whether each relevant business is a specified service trade or business. This deduction was set to expire for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA makes the deduction permanent and makes relatively minor modifications to the manner in which the limitations are phased in for taxpayers with taxable income above the threshold amounts for such taxable years, as well as including a minimum deduction of $400 (plus inflation adjustments) for certain taxpayers.

2. Extension of “Bonus” Depreciation Allowance for Certain Property. The BBBA permanently extends the “bonus” depreciation provisions in the TCJA allowing taxpayers to immediately expense 100% of the cost of qualified property (including most equipment and machinery) acquired after January 19, 2025.

3. Increased Dollar Limitations for Expensing of Certain Depreciable Business Assets. Under pre-BBBA law (IRC section 179) a taxpayer may elect to expense the cost of qualifying property, rather than to recover such costs through depreciation deductions, up to a maximum amount of $1 million (plus inflation adjustments) for the taxable year. This $1 million limitation is reduced by the amount by which the cost of such property placed in service during the taxable year exceeds $2.5 million (plus inflation adjustments).

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, the BBBA increases the $1 million limitation and $2.5 million phase-out threshold to $2.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, adjusted for inflation.

4. Deduction of R&E Expenditures. Pre-BBBA law requires that qualifying domestic research and experimental expenditures be amortized over 5 years. The BBBA allows taxpayers to (1) immediately deduct domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 and (2) accelerate the deduction of remaining unamortized domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2025. Notably, however, there is a specific exclusion for and, thus, immediate deductibility does not apply to, any expenditure paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas). Additionally, certain small business taxpayers are permitted to apply these changes retroactively for domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.

5. Special Depreciation Allowance for Qualified Production Property. The BBBA provides for an immediate deduction for 100% of the cost of certain depreciable real property used as an integral part of a qualified production activity if, among other things, (i) the property is placed in service in the U.S. or any possession of the U.S., (ii) the original use of the property begins with the taxpayer, (iii) the construction of the property begins after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029 and (iv) the property is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031. A “qualified production activity” generally means the manufacturing, chemical or agricultural production, or refining of tangible personal property. An activity generally does not count as a qualified production activity unless it results in a substantial transformation of the property comprising a product.

6. Modified Calculation of Adjusted Taxable Income for Purposes of Business Interest Deduction. Under pre-BBBA law, the deduction for business interest expense for a taxable year is generally limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s ""adjusted taxable income” (plus the taxpayer’s business interest income and “floor plan financing interest”) for the taxable year. “Adjusted taxable income” generally corresponds to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

The BBBA modifies the “adjusted taxable income” definition for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 so that it (1) is computed without taking into account deductions for depreciation, amortization, or depletion (which generally corresponds to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)) and (2) excludes global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and income inclusions under IRC section 951(a) and IRC section 78 (and the portion of the deductions allowed under IRC sections 245A(a) (by reason of IRC section 964(e)(4)) and 250(a)(1)(B) by reason of such inclusions).

7. Renewal and Enhancement of Opportunity Zone Tax Benefits. Pre-BBBA law provides tax benefits for investments in qualified opportunity funds (“QOFs”), which generally are funds which invest in qualified opportunity zones. These tax benefits include temporary deferral of taxation of existing capital gains that are invested in a QOF, tax basis step-up, and exclusion of certain taxable gain ultimately realized on the QOF investment. These were set to expire at the end of 2026.

The BBBA provides for a second, permanent, round of QOFs beginning on January 1, 2027, with rolling ten-year qualified opportunity zone designations, subject to narrower eligibility requirements. The second round of QOFs would have similar but modified benefits, including temporary deferral of taxes on existing capital gains, tax basis step-up (including an increased basis step-up for investments in “qualified rural opportunity funds”) and exclusion of certain taxable gain ultimately realized on the QOF investment.

8. Expansion of Qualified Small Business Stock Gain Exclusion. Under pre-BBBA law, 100% of the gain from the sale of qualified small business stock (“QSBS”) by a noncorporate taxpayer is excluded from taxable income if certain conditions are satisfied, including that the QSBS was held for more than five years. A taxpayer’s QSBS exclusion for a taxable year with respect to a single corporate issuer is subject to a limit equal to the greater of (i) the remaining portion of a lifetime exclusion limit of $10 million ($5 million in the case of a separate return of a married individual) with respect to such corporate issuer and (ii) ten times the aggregate adjusted bases of QSBS issued by such corporate issuer and disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year. A corporation generally cannot qualify as a “qualified small business” when it issues stock if the corporation’s aggregate gross assets exceed $50 million at any time after 1993 through the moment immediately after the stock issuance.

The BBBA relaxes the holding period requirements that must be met in order for gain from QSBS to be excluded from taxable income. In particular, under the BBBA, 50% of the gain would be excluded for QSBS stock held at least three years, 75% for four years, and 100% for five years or more. The BBBA also increases the lifetime exclusion limit for QSBS gains from a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million (which is halved in the case of a separate return by a married individual) and raises the gross asset limit for a corporation to qualify as a ""qualified small business"" from $50 million to $75 million. Both thresholds are indexed for inflation beginning in 2027. These changes generally apply to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, with respect to QSBS issued or acquired after July 4, 2025.

9. Increase in Threshold for Requiring Information Reporting With Respect to Certain Payees. Under pre-BBBA law, the reporting threshold for payments by a business for services performed by an independent contractor or subcontractor and for certain other payments is generally $600.

The BBBA generally would increase the threshold to $2,000 for payments made after December 31, 2025, and adjust the threshold for inflation for calendar years after 2026.

10. Limitation on Individual Deductions for State and Local Taxes. Under pre-BBBA law, in the case of an individual, the itemized deduction for state and local taxes is capped at $10,000 ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) (the “SALT cap”) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026.

The BBBA increases the SALT cap to $40,000 ($20,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2030, subject to a phasedown in the case of taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income above specified thresholds (with the SALT cap not being reduced below $10,000, or $5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The BBBA also generally increases the SALT cap by 1% each year for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026, and before January 1, 2030. Finally, the BBBA provides for the SALT cap to permanently return to $10,000 ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2029. Notably, the BBBA does not include the provisions in prior versions of the bill which in some cases would have denied deductions for state and local taxes paid under pass-through entity tax, or “PTET”, regimes of states and localities.

11. Limitation on Excess Business Losses of Noncorporate Taxpayers. The BBBA makes permanent the limitations in effect under pre-BBBA law on deductions for “excess business losses” and continues to permit any excess business losses to be carried forward as NOLs in subsequent taxable years.

12. 1% Floor on Deduction of Charitable Contributions Made By Corporations. The BBBA limits the deduction of charitable contributions by corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025 to only that portion of such contributions which exceeds 1% of the corporation’s taxable income for the taxable year. If such contributions exceed 10% of the corporation’s taxable income for the taxable year, then any charitable contribution deductions disallowed by the 1% floor generally can be carried forward for 5 taxable years.

13. Substantial Changes to Clean Energy Tax Incentives. The BBBA makes substantial changes to the clean energy tax credits enacted, extended and expanded as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Please click here for a more detailed discussion of these BBBA provisions.

14. Payments from Partnerships to Partners for Property or Services. Under pre-BBBA law (IRC section 707(a)(2)), certain payments or transfers to partners from a partnership for property or services may be treated as transactions between the partnership and a non-partner “[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Secretary.” The BBBA makes IRC section 707(a)(2) self-effecting “[e]xcept as provided” by the Secretary for services performed by or property transfers to partners after July 4, 2025. The BBBA further provides that this change “shall [not] be construed to create any inference with respect to the proper treatment under section 707(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to payments from a partnership to a partner for services performed, or property transferred, on or before the date of the enactment of this Act.”

15. No Carried Interest Provisions. The BBBA does not include any provisions directly changing the taxation of carried interests.

16. Expansion of Publicly Traded Partnership Qualifying Income. The BBBA would expand the definition of “qualifying income” under IRC section 7704 for publicly traded partnerships to include certain income from an electricity generating facility that satisfies certain carbon capture requirements, as well as certain income from the production of electricity at certain nuclear facilities, the production of electricity or thermal energy from geothermal or hydropower facilities and the operation of geothermal or geothermal heat pump property, and would restore to “qualifying income” status the income from transportation or storage of two products that were inadvertently eliminated by TCJA.

INTERNATIONAL TAX PROVISIONS

Some of the key international tax provisions include the following:

1. Changes to FDII (now “FDDEI”) and GILTI (now “NCTI”) Rules. Under pre-BBBA law, a U.S. corporation was allowed a deduction equal to 37.5% of its foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and 50% of its inclusions with respect to GILTI. Each of FDII and GILTI were generally determined by reducing the income base by an amount equal to a deemed tangible income return of 10% (DTIR). The FDII and GILTI deductions were scheduled to be reduced to 21.875% and 37.5%, respectively, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA (1) renames the FDII and GILTI provisions as foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI) and net CFC tested income (NCTI), respectively, (2) eliminates the DTIR reduction utilized in determining a U.S. corporation’s FDII (now FDDEI) and a U.S. shareholder’s GILTI (now NCTI) inclusion, and (3) limits the allocation and apportionment of interest and other deductions to GILTI (now NCTI) for foreign tax credit purposes.

The BBBA also permanently sets the deduction amount for FDDEI and NCTI to 33.34% and 40%, respectively, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, resulting in effective tax rates of 14% and 12.6%, respectively. However, because the BBBA increases the allowed foreign tax credit for NCTI inclusions from 80% to 90% of foreign taxes, a local tax rate of 14% on NCTI is required to offset the effective U.S. tax rate of 12.6%.

2. Change in Base Erosion Minimum Tax (“BEAT”) Amount. Under pre-BBBA law, BEAT applies to corporations with annual gross receipts in excess of $500 million and base erosion payments above a certain threshold and imposes an additional tax to the extent that 10% of an applicable corporation’s modified taxable income exceeds its regular tax liability (reduced by certain specified tax credits). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, under pre-BBBA law, the 10% rate was scheduled to increase to 12.5% and the corporation’s regular tax liability would be reduced by all allowable credits (rather than just certain specified credits).

The BBBA permanently sets the BEAT rate at 10.5% and retains the pre-BBBA treatment of tax credits for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

3. Non-Enactment of Revenge Tax. The BBBA does not include the IRC section 899 “revenge tax” that was included in prior versions of the bill. Section 899 was removed from the bill in conjunction with the G7 countries announcing they will provide guidance on how the U.S. tax system and Pillar II will operate side-by-side in the coming months including to materially reduce compliance burdens for U.S. parented multinationals.

4. Section 954(c)(6) “Look Through Rule” Extension Made Permanent. The BBBA makes permanent the “look-through rule” in IRC section 954(c)(6) which exempts from foreign personal holding company of a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”) income dividends, interest, rents, and royalties between related CFCs to the extent that such items are not attributable to subpart F income or income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the payor.

5. Limitations on Downward Attribution of Stock for CFC Purposes. The BBBA (1) restores the limitation on downward attribution of stock ownership from a foreign person to a U.S. person, former IRC section 958(b)(4), when applying the constructive ownership rules for purposes of the CFC rules, but (2) adds a new IRC section 951B to allow for downward attribution from a foreign person to a U.S. person in more limited cases involving foreign-controlled U.S. shareholders. These rules apply to tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2025.

6. Deferral Election Repealed. The BBBA repeals the IRC section 898 one-month deferral election for taxable years of specified foreign corporations beginning after November 30, 2025. The election previously permitted a CFC to elect a taxable year beginning one month earlier than its majority U.S. shareholder.

7. Subpart F Treatment of Partial Year CFCs and U.S. Shareholders. The BBBA provides that, if a foreign corporation is a CFC at any time during its tax year, each US shareholder that owns stock in that corporation during such tax year is required to include in gross income such shareholder’s pro rata share of the corporation’s subpart F income for the CFC year. Similar modified pro rata share rules would apply in the calculation of a US shareholder’s GILTI inclusion. This rule would apply to tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2025.

TAXATION OF INDIVIDUALS

Some of the other key provisions impacting individuals include the following:

The BBBA makes permanent the reduction in the individual income tax rates made by the TCJA.

The BBBA increases the estate and lifetime gift tax exemption amount to $15 million (plus the unused exclusion amount of a deceased spouse), indexed for inflation going forward, for estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA makes permanent the increased individual alternative minimum tax exemption amounts and reverts the exemption phase-out thresholds to their original 2018 levels under the TCJA, while indexing them to inflation. Such exemption amounts and phase-out thresholds were otherwise set to expire for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA makes permanent the elimination of deductions for miscellaneous itemized deductions made by the TCJA and which currently exists.

The BBBA reduces other itemized deductions of individual taxpayers who have taxable incomes in excess of the dollar amount at which the 37% rate bracket begins ($751,600 for married couples filing jointly in 2025). The reduction equals 2/37ths of the lesser of:

(1) such amount of itemized deductions; or

(2) so much of the taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year (determined without regard to this section and increased by such amount of itemized deductions) as exceeds the dollar amount at which the 37 percent rate bracket under section 1 begins with respect to the taxpayer.

This reduction applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Like solar and wind power, this energy is clean and renewable. But unlike solar and wind, it is also “firm”: available day in and day out, no matter the weather.

Geothermal is one of the few mature energy technologies (along with nuclear and hydroelectricity) that can offer firm power without producing climate-warming greenhouse gases. Although geothermal provides a tiny fraction of the world’s energy today, new technologies are swiftly expanding where and how we can harness the Earth’s heat.

The heat beneath our feet

The Earth’s core contains radioactive metals that constantly give off heat. Where this heat reaches the surface, it can fuel roiling hot springs or erupt in explosive geysers.

The first geothermal power plants were built on these natural sources of steam. Steam from hot springs turned a turbine to power a generator, just like in a coal-fired power plant.1

Modern geothermal plants find or make steam deeper underground. A pair of wells is drilled into the Earth, up to around 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) deep, where the rock is boiling hot.2 Water is pumped into the first well to seep into pores and cracks in the rock below. As the water heats up, it emerges from the second well and becomes steam that turns a turbine. Water can be continuously recycled through this system, making electricity all the while.

These power plants must be built on a very specific geology, with permeable rock and high heat near the Earth’s surface. This has mostly limited geothermal power to regions with lots of tectonic activity, like California, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Central America.

Widening the map

In small countries with rich underground heat, geothermal can be an important part of the power mix. Kenya gets almost half its electricity from geothermal,3 and Iceland uses geothermal for 30% of its electricity and nearly all its home heating.4 But globally, only around 0.3% of electricity comes from geothermal.5

Modern drilling technology is pushing these limits. As the cost of drilling falls, several countries have explored building geothermal power outside tectonically active areas, in places where the high heat needed lies deeper underground.

“Enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS) are also tapping heat from new kinds of rock formations. Engineers use horizontal drilling, pressurized water, and perforation guns to create fissures in rock that would otherwise be too solid for water to seep through. While only a few EGS plants are running today, projects in the western United States have broken records for how quickly EGS wells can be drilled—at costs that suggest geothermal energy could soon compete with coal, gas, wind, and solar across much of the world.6

Geothermal technologyDescriptionDry steam plant

The simplest type of geothermal power plant, a dry steam plant is built over the porous rock of a natural underground reservoir. Steam from this reservoir rises through a producer well.

This steam turns a turbine to make electricity. After making power, the steam passes through a condenser where it becomes liquid water. Finally, the cooled water is piped back underground through an injection well to be used again.

Flash steam plantIn a flash steam plant, the water piped from underground is under such high pressure that, even at super-hot temperatures, some or all of it remains liquid. The mix of water and steam that reaches the surface must pass through a low-pressure separator (or be “flashed”) to send a pure stream of steam to the turbine. Afterwards, the water is condensed and reinjected, just as in a dry steam plant.Binary cycle plantA binary cycle plant can make power from only moderately hot water. Instead of going to a turbine, the water passes through a heat exchanger. Here, it heats up a second fluid with a lower boiling point than water. It is this second fluid that becomes a vapor and turns a turbine to make power, in a self-contained loop that allows it to be recycled.Enhanced geothermal systems

An enhanced geothermal system accesses geothermal energy in places where the rock is not naturally permeable.

During the drilling process, high-pressure water is injected into the wells, fracturing the surrounding rock. As water seeps through these cracks, it absorbs the underground heat of the rock. The fractures also let water pass between the injection and producer wells, just as it would in a natural reservoir.

An enhanced geothermal system can use either flash steam or binary cycle technology.

Beyond electricity

Geothermal heat can be used for more than turning turbines. Boise, Idaho, which sits on a geothermally heated underground river, has been piping its naturally hot water into buildings to heat them for over 100 years.7 This kind of geothermal district heating is also found in cities like Izmir, Turkey; Munich, Germany; and most of Iceland. It can even use the same hot water that circulates in a geothermal power plant, providing heat and electricity together.

Geothermal energy is also used in paper mills, milk pasteurization, greenhouse farming, and other industries that need steam or moderate heat.

Geothermal heat pumps

Most geothermal technologies rely on deep drilling and rich underground reservoirs. But ground-source heat pumps, the most efficient way to heat and cool buildings today, can be built almost anywhere.

A heat pump acts like a sponge for heat, capturing it from one place and moving it to another. The best-known type of heat pump is an air conditioner, which soaks up heat from indoor air and pumps it outside. Reversible heat pumps can also warm buildings, by shuttling in heat from the outside. Because they move heat, rather than make heat, heat pumps are more energy efficient than natural gas or heating oil, create far less climate pollution, and in most American homes, also lower heating costs.8

Geothermal energy makes heat pumps even more efficient. A ground-source heat pump takes its heat not from the air, but from the earth. Pipes are drilled into the ground, to a depth where there are steady temperatures all year—typically around 50 °F (10 °C).9 A liquid circulates through these pipes, exchanging heat with the ground. In the winter, the system absorbs the ground’s heat and brings it inside; in the summer, it moves heat the other way.

Thanks to the constant moderate temperature, ground-source heat pumps are almost twice as efficient as air-to-air systems. Most importantly, they use only about 25% as much power when it really counts—during the coldest or hottest hours of the year. This is crucial, because if all homes are heated with electricity, power grids could be overwhelmed during these extreme weather hours. Many utilities and state agencies offer financial incentives to help people install ground-source heat pumps that put much less strain on the grid.

While geothermal heating is still rare, it is growing, especially in municipal buildings such as schools. Home systems are also becoming more common, helped by drilling and efficiency improvements that continue to boost performance and lower cost.

Geothermal in your neighborhood

Adding a ground-source heat pump to a building requires land, and installing it is costly.

As an alternative, some communities are putting in geothermal networks: a network of pipes with the holes drilled in convenient locations, to bring everyone in the area the benefits of ground-source heat pumps. These systems have been built on several college campuses around the United States, and utilities have started building them for entire neighborhoods, including in Boston, Massachusetts, Brooklyn, New York, and Washington, D.C.

Geothermal networks offer fairer access to this clean source of heat, while sharing the costs of drilling across many buildings. Today’s pilot projects will help show whether, and where, geothermal networks can provide heat as cheaply as natural gas, giving utilities a clean way to heat whole neighborhoods or cities when gas pipes reach the end of their useful life.

Evergy Kansas Central customers will see bills increase about 8.6% to build the new plants, KCC filings said.

EKC, the subsidiary of Evergy Inc. that serves Kansas customers, will be 50% co-owner of the two 710-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plants and 100% owner of the Kansas Sky solar facility, to be built in Douglas County. The Viola gas plant will be built in Sumner County, and the McNew gas plant will be in Reno County.

Cost of construction is estimated to be $788.75 million for the Viola plant and $800.52 million for the McNew plant, according to EKC’s filings. The solar field is expected to cost $228.1 million.

The other half of the two natural gas plants will be owned by Evergy Missouri West, but only if the Missouri Public Service Commission — KCC’s Missouri counterpart — approves the construction.

The Missouri commission’s staff has recommended against pre-construction approval because too many costs in the proposal were uncertain, according to Missouri Public Service Commission filings.

Rate concerns

The decision to build the natural gas plants was opposed by the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, industrial consumers and environmental groups, among others. In general, most agreed with building the solar plant, according to documents filed at KCC.

Commissioners also made note of their concerns about Evergy rates.

“The commission is concerned and troubled by the frequency and magnitude of rate cases, and strongly encourages Evergy to focus on pacing its proposed investments to better align those investments with actual load growth and the mitigation of large rate increases,” said Commissioner Dwight Keen at Monday’s virtual hearing.

Keen said that while the commission approves the addition of generation capabilities to meet the needs of Kansans and ensure stability of the power grid, they remain concerned about rate increases. Evergy currently has a separate rate case at KCC, asking for as much as a 15% hike to residential rates, which would be on top of the increase from building the plants.

Evergy last received a $41 million rate hike in 2023.

“The commission understands that from time to time, new investment in electric capacity is needed to support reliability and economic development in Kansas,” he said. “However, affordability and genuine maximum capacity needs must be major priorities and proactively pursued as Evergy addresses a seemingly endless list of ostensibly justifiable projects and initiatives.”

His words were matched by opponents to building the natural gas plants.

Opponents

Jim Zakoura, president of the Kansas Industrial Consumers Group, said Evergy has enough generation to meet electricity demand if current electricity systems, such as coal plants, are not retired before the end of their useful manufacturing life.

“Evergy’s plans to retire coal facilities early, while those facilities continue to provide electric service at costs which are far lower than new gas-fired generation, is not related to increased electric demand,” Zakoura said in a statement. “It is simply trading low-cost generation for high-cost generation to serve the same level of demand. Retail ratepayers get no greater value for their money — only higher prices.”

KCC staff and commissioners don’t agree.

“The oldest of the Jeffries units was commissioned in 1978 and will be over 50 years old if the proposed Viola combined cycle gas generation plant comes online in 2029,” Keen said. “It is impossible to know the exact timing of when coal units will retire. Load growth may require their lifespan to be extended, or environmental policy changes or technological advances may shorten their lives.”

Keen said an October 2022 fire at the Jeffrey Energy Center in Pottawatomie County caused that unit to be out of service for more than a year.

Officials with the Sierra Club, which testified in the Missouri Public Service Commission case for Evergy’s proposed plants and not in the Kansas case, said ratepayers are being asked to take on costs and subsidize a billion-dollar industry.

“Governor Kelly and KCC Commissioners supported and approved these gas plants, and now they have the opportunity to ensure that utilities and data centers pay their fair share, because the alleged new demand for electricity is from data centers, not Kansas families or existing businesses,” said Zack Pistora, director of the Kansas chapter.

Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, expressed concerns that natural gas prices are difficult to predict.

“I am really worried that we are going to push ourselves into a really risky position with fossil fuels,” she said. “I obviously am concerned about the climate impacts of adding fossil fuels, right? But secondarily, gas prices are so volatile. We saw that with Winter Storm Uri. It’s supply and demand.”

Winter Storm Uri brought arctic weather to the Midwest in February 2021, resulting in increased utility prices for most customers after natural gas prices shot high because of production problems and high usage.

Costs of natural gas are a “straight pass-through” from the utilities, she said. She referred to Empire District Electric, which in 2007 served southeast Kansas.

“They were heavily invested in gas and people couldn’t pay their bills,” Barnett said. “They were one of the first utilities that began to invest in wind in Kansas.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) risks erasing earnings from carbon credit sales. Also, Elon Musk’s recent political endorsement rattles investors, and Canada has frozen $40 million in aid over environmental concerns tied to Tesla’s projects.

Together, these developments supersede typical market volatility and signal a potential turning point. Let’s examine each of these instances and consider their impact on Tesla.

OBBB Bill Could Erase Billions in Carbon Credit Profits

In 2024, Tesla generated a record $2.76 billion by selling regulatory credits (carbon credits), which is nearly 39% of its net income ($7.09 billion) that year. These credits allowed other automakers—unable to meet emissions standards—to avoid penalties by purchasing Tesla’s excess credits. Over time, Tesla has earned more than $10 billion from credits since 2017.

However, the OBBB threatens to overturn this revenue stream. The bill removes clean energy and EV tax credits. This includes credits linked to emissions performance. It also ends federal penalties for vehicles that do not comply.

With this policy shift, analysts warn Tesla could lose as much as 80–90% of its U.S. carbon credit income, which could result in a loss of more than $2 billion in annual revenue.

RELATED: Tesla’s Carbon Credits Crash in Q1 2025: Earnings Drop and EV Sales Fall

Tesla aims to close this gap by boosting vehicle production and cutting costs. However, the electric vehicle (EV) industry faces challenges. Global EV sales hit 17 million units in 2024, and they could exceed 20 million in 2025. However, growth might slow down due to changes in policy.

The global EV market is now valued at $1.33 trillion. It is expected to grow to $6.5 trillion by 2030, showing a 32.5% annual growth rate. However, some analysts predict a more conservative growth rate of 14.5%, estimating it will reach around $1.66 trillion by 2030.

Investor Concern Mounts After Musk’s Political Endorsement

Tesla’s stock fell sharply in early July following Elon Musk’s public endorsement of a conservative politician. While credit sales had buoyed Tesla’s earnings, market analysts say that “more backlash could affect demand among politically sensitive consumers”.

Market experts also warned that this move could threaten TSLA’s value. Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, noted:

“Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story.”

The stock dropped by ~15% since early 2025, partly due to OBBB concerns and Musk’s activism. Investors are now recalculating Tesla’s value without carbon credit income: P/E ratios may fall significantly.

Why Canada Hit Pause on $40M in Tesla Aid

This decision further comes from concerns about not consulting Indigenous groups and potential environmental risks. Canadian officials have tied funding release to Tesla’s compliance with strict environmental standards and local partnership agreements.

This move is more than financial; it signals stronger scrutiny of Tesla’s global operations. As Tesla plans new battery or vehicle manufacturing in Canada, this aid freeze raises potential execution risks and reputational exposure.

Global EV Landscape and Tesla’s Expanding Competition

Tesla, once the undisputed leader, is facing growing competition. China continues to dominate, accounting for two-thirds of EV sales and holding nearly 60% of global EV production.

Meanwhile, BYD overtook Tesla in global EV market share (16% vs. 14%). The Chinese carmaker continues to gain ground in international markets, including Europe and Southeast Asia.

Tesla’s competitive edge is being challenged not only by Chinese automakers but also by legacy carmakers. These include Volkswagen, Hyundai, and GM, which are accelerating their EV rollouts.

Hyundai-Kia, for example, now holds nearly 7% global EV share, and Volkswagen has committed to launching 30+ new EV models by 2030. Startups like Rivian and Lucid are also carving out niche segments.

Despite positive long-term trends, the U.S. EV market is slowing. The International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its forecast for U.S. EV market share to 41% by 2030. This is a drop from nearly 50%. They point to fading subsidies and rising EV prices as reasons for this change.

BloombergNEF agreed, saying that policy uncertainties might slow EV adoption. This could affect over $150 billion in planned battery investments.

Can Tesla Weather the Storm?

Given the various challenges Tesla is facing, can it surpass all these and regain investors’ trust once again? Here are the top concerns to watch out for in the EV leader’s future.

1. Will vehicle sales make up for lost credit revenue?

Tesla needs to significantly boost sales. However, its 2024 deliveries — 1.78 million EVs — marked the first decline year-over-year. Its path forward relies on a balanced mix of new models (Cybercab, affordable versions) and global rollout, but competition and policy delays remain risks.

2. Does Musk’s political play threaten brand appeal?

CEO visibility impacts Tesla’s brand. With a growing political rift among its consumer base and investors, Tesla may lose market traction unless it separates its business strategy from divisive rhetoric.

3. Will Canada’s compliance push stall expansion?

The Canadian aid freeze sets a precedent. Grant applications, potential program abuse, environmental oversight, and community engagement would be crucial to Tesla’s growth plans.

4. Can diversification maintain growth?

Tesla’s energy and AI segments suggest diversification. Its Powerwall and Megapack storage deployments reached 16.7 GWh in 2024, and its Supercharger network now exceeds 65,000 stalls. Expanding charging infrastructure, AI vehicle updates, and energy offerings could partially offset credit and auto earnings gaps.

Tesla faces a mix of policy, political, and operational pressures. These challenges threaten its profits from carbon credits. While the company has built resilience through innovation in energy, AI, and scale, reversing or adapting to policy reversals will be critical.

Success depends on Tesla’s ability to grow in volume, cut costs, and expand globally. In the meantime, the OBBB, Musk’s spotlight, and Canada’s freeze combine to make this a critical moment for the EV pioneer’s future.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2275471993.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 15:13:51.606317

While each household’s situation and energy consumption patterns are different, the findings show that deep energy bill reductions can be enabled through household energy upgrades.

As an additional benefit, household energy upgrades offer a particularly low-cost form of emissions abatement.
Recommendations Federal and state governments should commit to halve household energy bills over the next decade.","The rapid rise of abundant low-cost solar is driving Australian wholesale electricity costs to record low levels in the middle of the day. However, Australian households continue to see rising energy bills, due to factors including increasing coal and gas prices, outages at ageing power stations and network cost rises.

The policy debate on how to address rising energy costs has largely focused on the wrong solutions. This includes one-off power bill subsidies, and deliberation over whether to slow down the rollout of large-scale renewables in favour of alternatives (which more often than not would actually increase power prices).

These debates ignore the fact that energy bills are a product of not only the price of energy, but the amount of energy we consume. And reducing the energy that households consume from the grid (and using it more smartly) is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy costs.

Households that burn gas in their homes are wasting significant amounts of energy to meet their basic needs, as are those in poor thermally-performing homes, and those who rely on inefficient electric appliances.

Furthermore, while many Australian households now have rooftop solar, this can’t be put to its full potential when energy demand is concentrated in the evening, or met by burning gas.

This report presents the results of new IEEFA modelling, which finds that household energy upgrades including efficient electric appliances, rooftop solar and batteries could slash household energy bills by more than 90% in many regions.

These savings are based on a typical, representative household in each capital city. While each household’s situation and energy consumption patterns are different, the findings show that deep energy bill reductions can be enabled through household energy upgrades. These upgrades could form the core of a strategy to halve household energy bills.

Household energy upgrades also benefit other energy users, by cutting gas demand in constrained periods, and reducing peak electricity demand on the grid. This can result in lower generation costs and, in theory, lower network costs.

As an additional benefit, household energy upgrades offer a particularly low-cost form of emissions abatement. The upgrades modelled in this report would not only see overall energy consumption fall, but would shift electricity consumption to periods where solar is abundant, and the emissions intensity of electricity production is lowest.

In some regions such as Victoria, a poorly managed transition from gas to efficient electric appliances could result in a long-term increase in winter electricity demand. While shifting households off gas is highly beneficial in reducing expected gas supply gaps and greenhouse gas emissions, it also creates a need to consider how to manage peak demand in winter. Batteries, thermal shell upgrades and pre-heating are effective options to manage this.

Many household energy upgrades are highly cost-effective for households today – particularly where they are supported by federal or state rebates.

While residential batteries have longer payback periods than other upgrades, a combination of new federal rebates and expected future cost reductions will make them increasingly attractive. They will become even more cost-effective if their contributions to the grid during peak times are fairly valued.

Utilising the battery capacity in electric vehicles is a particularly significant untapped opportunity, if vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid capabilities are unlocked via the right standards and regulations.

Homes with thermally efficient building shells offer the lowest running costs and the greatest opportunities to reduce peak demand. This includes through pre-heating and pre-cooling their home, which delivers some of the benefits of a battery at a fraction of the cost.

Despite the financial attractiveness of household energy upgrades, many households including renters or those on low incomes have no ability to undertake upgrades. Furthermore, even consumers who can invest in household energy upgrades are subject to “bounded rationality”

– a barrier that is often overlooked by energy efficiency policies.

Increasing minimum energy performance standards to encourage a shift from gas or inefficient electric appliances to efficient electric alternatives is a compelling solution. New legislation to phase out gas hot water systems in Victoria presents one example of an approach to achieve this, and there is an opportunity to reinvigorate the federal Equipment Energy Efficiency programme.

In the near term, financial incentives play a critical role to reduce the upfront cost hurdle for consumers and scale up the industry capacity to deliver upgrades. However, the current approach to incentives is piecemeal.

Victoria and New South Wales have implemented broad-based incentives for household energy upgrades, but there is a case for more comprehensive national versions of these schemes to be rolled out, which could be complemented with specific state government schemes where they would bring further benefits.

Pricing reform is not the sole solution, but it is nonetheless critical to ensure consumers have access to fair electricity plans that reward their contributions to the grid, without imposing unrealistic expectations on consumers to become energy traders.

Finally, household energy upgrades will have material consequences for gas and electricity distribution networks – potentially reducing the overall reliance on both networks, while presenting opportunities to use electricity distribution networks more efficiently.

This offers an opportunity to reduce network costs for consumers. However, a first-principles review of electricity network regulation is necessary to ensure those benefits can translate to better consumer outcomes.

Recommendations

Federal and state governments should commit to halve household energy bills over the next decade.

This should be based on a roadmap to roll out the technologies discussed in this report, accompanied by a policy pathway to deliver them.

Minimum energy performance standards should be expanded and increased to discourage installation of gas or inefficient electric appliances, and encourage installation of efficient and flexible electric appliances.

A comprehensive, national incentive scheme for energy upgrades should be implemented.

This could involve expanding the Victorian and/or New South Wales incentive schemes nation-wide, or by expanding and extending the federal Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme.

The scheme should support demand flexibility measures, extend beyond 2030, and consider the wide range of equitable funding approaches.

Fairer electricity pricing structures should be provided for consumers that offer reasonable rewards for efforts to reduce peak demand.

This should include improved tariffs, and well-designed, well-regulated Virtual Power Plants that support the interests of consumers and the grid. This should be considered as central to the Australian Energy Market Commission’s ongoing electricity pricing review.

A first-principles review of the economic regulation of gas and electricity networks should be undertaken.

This should be led by an independent panel with expertise in economic regulation, competition policy and consumer energy resources.

The review should re-evaluate the cost recovery approach for energy networks to fairly reflect the diminishing value of some assets (such as the gas distribution network asset base), while providing the right incentives to support wider uptake of consumer energy resources.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/aus-solar-shutterstock_1015544242.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 15:14:06.404808

Now is not the time to take a break from advocating for renewable energy tax credits.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) has a significant impact on the renewable energy sector, particularly with changes in the phase-out schedules for wind and solar projects under Section 45Y and 48E, as well as the nuances between the “beginning of construction” and “placed in service” language. Yesterday, the Trump administration issued an Executive Order on the renewable energy provisions established in the OBBB. Among other things, the order requires the Secretary of Treasury to:

take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

The Executive Order shouldn’t come as a surprise. Last week, it was reported that House conservatives were assured by the Trump administration that it would crack down on renewable energy tax credits and projects in exchange for their vote.

Renewable energy companies face a crucial question: What comes next? Are renewable energy tax credits doomed? Will there be another reconciliation bill next year, and if so, will Congress attempt to delay the phase-out schedules for wind and solar projects? Will they seek to extend the “beginning of construction” language that barely made it into the last package?

If a reconciliation bill does materialize next year, it’ll be much closer to midterm elections. That means, House and Senate leadership will be eager to provide vulnerable Republican members with “wins,” potentially bringing the renewable energy sector back onto center stage. It’s a good thing that moderate Republicans were able to get a phased-out approach and “beginning of construction” language in the reconciliation package – bringing back such measures from the grave would have been significantly more challenging.
