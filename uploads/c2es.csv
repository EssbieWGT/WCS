CID Gulf LLC, an Omani-Moroccan engineering consultancy firm, has announced that it has secured a prestigious contract to provide design consultancy services for the establishment of Oman’s first wind turbine manufacturing project at Duqm SEZ. The client is Mawarid Turbines — a subsidiary of Oman’s integrated energy powerhouse, OQ Group.

Muscat-based CID Gulf is a joint venture established by Khonji Engineering Consultancy, a member of Mohamed & Ahmed Alkhonji LLC (MAK), a leading Omani tech-based products and services holding company and Conseil, Ingénierie et Développement (CID), a Moroccan consultancy engineering firm operating across the African continent and the Middle East.

“This project represents a cornerstone in the Sultanate of Oman’s move towards clean energy, local industrialisation and long-term sustainability. We are honoured to contribute to this national initiative alongside key government and private sector stakeholders”, CID Gulf noted in a post on Friday.

The award underscores a fast-track approach to the implementation of Mawarid Turbines — a landmark bid to localise wind turbine manufacturing to cater to the large domestic market as well as regional demand. Oman’s requirement for wind turbines to support the country’s energy transition — spanning grid-connected clean energy generation and the ambitious green hydrogen sector — is estimated in the thousands over the next couple of decades.

Phase 1 of the facility, to be developed on a sprawling 550,000 m² site in the SEZ, entails an investment of around RO 70 million. The wind turbine manufacturing capacity of this phase is projected at around 1,100 MW per year, focusing on the production of two turbine models — the 6.25 MW and the 9.6 MW. Technology for the project will be licensed from Shanghai Electric Group, a major player in China’s clean energy equipment manufacturing sector.

Among the first recipients of the turbines — covering not only nacelle hubs housing the generators but potentially other components as well — are grid —connected, wind-based Independent Power Projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah. While these projects will be developed by international developers (supported by their local consortium partners) selected through a competitive tender managed by Nama Power & Water Procurement (Nama PWP), OQ Alternative Energy (OQAE) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of OQ Group — has been assured a stake in them. This stake commitment, consistent with OQAE’s mandate as the national champion for renewable energy, covers an equity share of up to 25 per cent in all future renewable energy projects procured by Nama PWP, starting with the Ibri III Solar PV project — a 500 MW scheme slated for implementation in Al Dhahirah Governorate. In the case of the wind projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah, OQAE’s investment — in the form of locally manufactured wind turbines and potentially other contributions — will correspond to an equivalent stake in the respective project companies, it is learnt.

Phase 1 of Mawarid Turbines is expected to come on stream by late 2026 or early 2027.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/09/21/thumbs/600x600/3135108.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 13:00:34.929370

The Trump administration has signed into law several executive orders aimed at reducing the standing of renewable energies in the United States. The Trump administration has implemented a new approach to the energy sector that sees the traditional gas and coal sectors being favored instead of the wind and solar power sectors that have become more popular in recent years.

U.S. Wind alleges federal officials were under pressure from the Trump administration

A recent court filing has revealed that the Trump administration filed a request to a federal court to vacate a permit approved for US Wind’s proposed Maryland Offshore Wind project. The project could have a significant impact on the energy sector in the United States and has the capacity to provide enough electricity to power 718,000 homes. So why the filing from the Trump administration, you ask?

That filing states that US Wind’s project could create issues with search and rescue operations and commercial fisheries. If that sounds like a stretch to you, you are not alone. Several key players in the energy sector have come out to state their disapproval with the court filing by the Trump administration, claiming the only reason the current administration made the filing was because the project gained approval from the Biden administration.

The action was filed in the US District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore, and the Trump administration has been hard at work trying to find a feasible reason for asking the court to cease the approval process. The filing stated that the previous administration misinterpreted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which enabled the government to manage several key projects in federal waters across the country.

US Wind fights back against the recent action taken by the Trump administration

US Wind is not going to sit by and watch one of its most promising projects being taken away by the Trump administration, and has filed motions to dismiss parts of the suit and requested extensions for responses to the amended complaint.

“Political pressure was applied to the Federal Defendants’ decisionmakers, and the pressure caused those decisionmakers to rely on improper factors,” U.S. Wind alleged in the filing.

The company has claimed that the suit is a part of the Trump administration’s coordinated efforts to repeal any and all projects set up during the previous administration. U.S. Wind received approval to begin construction for the Maryland project in December 2024 and took pride in the fact that the project was the 10th commercial-scale wind project approved in the U.S. The evidence suggests that Trump has a personal vendetta against large wind farms.

The suit has local politicians split as to whether this is the right move for the energy sector in the United States. In August of this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced it was pulling $679 million from offshore wind projects nationwide. Maryland House Republicans praised the administration’s decision to revoke the permit and stated the project was “a bad idea that was never going to come to fruition.”

Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table.","A consensus is emerging across the political spectrum around the need for industrial policy. Whether in the form of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act under Joe Biden in 2022 or the haphazard tariff policy of Donald Trump implemented earlier this year, political leaders on both sides of the aisle are clearly searching for answers regarding how to revive the United States’s flagging manufacturing base.

While the Trump administration places a lot of rhetorical emphasis on bringing back industrial jobs, its policies so far have displayed a profound lack of seriousness or coherence. Trump’s tariffs have not been focused on strategic industries or paired with the investment and planning required to make jobs actually materialize. Attacks on agencies like the Department of Energy will make it difficult to build out even those energy sources that Trump claims to favor, like nuclear.

At the same time, the “abundance” debate, kicked off by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book of the same name, has drawn additional attention to the need for increased state capacity to make things and deliver improvements for ordinary people. This, the book’s authors argue, is the way to revive both the American economy and the Democratic Party. The discussion, fraught and flawed as it is, has captured the attention and imagination of liberals who don’t usually make a habit of thinking about industrial policy.

But there’s one constituency whose voice is missing and sorely needed in that debate: industrial workers and their unions. A new report from the United Auto Workers (UAW) Region 6 titled “Organize, Industrialize, Decarbonize: A Pro-Worker, Green Industrial Policy for California” takes up the challenge, providing a compelling example of how labor can weigh in on the reindustrialization conversation.

The report presents a vision for how the state can deploy a range of industrial policy tools to expand clean energy industries like offshore wind, electric vehicle batteries, and heat pumps. The same strategies would ensure that jobs created in this build-out become high-quality union careers. It’s precisely the kind of forward-thinking approach labor needs to take on industrial policy.

Trump’s return to office has effectively killed the momentum behind pro-labor clean energy investment that built up under Biden. Even while the current administration has expressed support for nuclear and geothermal development, its lack of appetite for competent state capacity throws serious doubt on its ability to follow through on a build-out.

In this bleak federal context, states can partner with trade unions to lead on industrial policies that show how a clean energy transition can create good jobs. The more progress is made on forming these coalitions now, the better positioned they’ll be when a more favorable national political climate emerges.

The Industrial Policy Tool Kit

The UAW Region 6 report begins by outlining the dilemmas that presently make carrying out a clean energy transition so challenging, especially if left up to private industry and markets. While working-class families are already reeling from inflation, private utilities are paying for climate investments by raising rates for consumers. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry remains a rare source of good blue-collar union jobs, and workers are rightfully concerned about their disappearance.

But the UAW believes that California’s rich research ecosystem and advanced manufacturing experience puts it in a strong position to be able to build out clean energy technologies. The report helpfully breaks down a range of industrial policy tools, from public procurement to enabling institutions, that the state can employ to favor union labor.

California already uses many of these tools successfully in different contexts. For example, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority has a public procurement provision that gives preference to bidders who create jobs within the county. The PowerForward ZEV Battery Manufacturing grant program incentivizes grant recipients to enter a card check neutrality agreement, have a collective bargaining agreement, and offer comprehensive benefits to their workers.

Enabling institutions, a designation that refers to government entities that carry out research and coordination between public and private institutions, are on the more ambitious side of the policy menu. These represent the building of actual state capacity instead of mere regulation. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is an example of such an enabling institution and played a crucial role in crafting Japan’s postwar economic boom.

UAW Region 6 is focusing its legislative campaigning on Senate Bill 787, which would create a state-level enabling institution in California to facilitate the growth of zero-emission vehicles and batteries (ZEVs), offshore wind, and heat pump manufacturing. It would require state agencies to coordinate funding in line with the goals of supply chain development and energy affordability.

A Pro-Worker Abundance

California contains the natural wealth to make this vision possible. The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has estimated that up to eighteen million metric tons of lithium exist in the state’s Salton Sea Region in the Imperial Valley. This is enough to build 375 million EV batteries. The report advocates expanding EV battery recycling capacity in order to create a fully self-sufficient supply chain.

Two hundred gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind potential exists off California’s coast, and the state already has the highest density of non-aircraft turbine manufacturing in the country. Just last year, voters approved a bond measure that earmarked $475 million for offshore wind port infrastructure. The UAW believes these conditions make the industry ripe for expansion in the state with the right level of planning. The report recommends that California seek to round out the supply chain by also producing component parts like generators, cells, and power converters.

With the Trump administration launching an all-out attack on offshore wind, it’s even more important for states like California to develop their own capacities to build out the industry and integrate the supply chain. Public projects can be financed over a longer term and better withstand the volatility of national energy policy than strictly private alternatives. For example, Golden State Wind is a joint venture between Ocean Winds and Reventus Power, which is owned by the national public pension plan in Canada. They plan to deploy 2 GW of wind capacity in the state.

Heat pumps are HVAC systems that use electricity instead of gas to heat and cool buildings. They get less attention as a clean energy technology, but they will play a vital role in reducing building emissions. Demand for heat pumps is projected to grow, and California has set a goal of six million installations over the next five years. UAW Region 6 argues that this is a perfect opportunity to use public procurement to create local, unionized employment.

Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table. While other important clean energy sources like nuclear power and geothermal are left out, the policy proposals play to California’s natural strengths and build on already existing successful initiatives.

Many on the Left have wholly dismissed the abundance concept as repackaged neoliberalism. But others have begun to thoughtfully argue that a chief concern of the Left should be increased state capacity to create good jobs and deliver improved lives. If we don’t offer a compelling vision for how to do this, others will.

The authors of the UAW report conclude by stating that they “wholeheartedly agree with authors Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein” on the need for “increased state capacity, empowered public authorities, and investments in innovation.” The UAW’s fight for SB 707 could be an important first step towards a pro-union abundance agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20114054/uaw-green.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:03:56.716048

The European Union has taken another major step towards cleaner skies with the announcement of €945 million in funding for a new wave of research and demonstration projects under its Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking.

Approved on 9 September, the investment will support 12 projects that promise to push the boundaries of propulsion, systems, and aircraft design.

This third call for proposals represents the largest single package to date under the Clean Aviation programme, which falls within Horizon Europe. It is designed to accelerate the development of next-generation regional and short-medium range aircraft capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% compared with 2020 technology.

Work on the projects is due to start at the beginning of 2026, with first flight tests expected in the 2028–2029 timeframe. By laying the groundwork for new aircraft entering service around 2035, the initiative is a central pillar of Europe’s aviation decarbonisation roadmap.

The €945 million pot combines EU grants with industry contributions and in-kind support. It has been divided between large demonstration programmes for regional and short-medium range aircraft, a set of “Fast Track” enabler projects, and transversal studies into aircraft concept integration and environmental impact.

“The results of Call 3 show the variety of innovative technological concepts to boost the entry-into-service of highly efficient aircraft by 2035,” says Axel Krein, Executive Director of the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking. “These projects have high potential to make major advancements towards climate neutrality and sustainability.”

Collectively, the 12 winners represent a blend of established OEMs, engine makers, electrical specialists, and smaller innovators, all aligned behind the EU’s climate ambitions.

The EU Clean Aviation chosen dozen

TAKE OFF

Led by Safran Aircraft Engines, TAKE OFF – Technology And Knowledge for European Open Fan Flight – will push forward open fan architecture engines. This disruptive engine design promises significant improvements in propulsive efficiency and is one of the most visible bets on how the next generation of single-aisle aircraft might take shape.

LEIA

Airbus Operations GmbH is coordinating LEIA, the Large scalE Integration demonstrator of hybrid electrical Architecture. The programme will explore how large-scale hybrid-electric power architectures can be integrated into commercial aircraft, bringing together multiple propulsion and energy systems in a single demonstrator.

UNIFIED

Rolls-Royce plc is taking forward UNIFIED, or Ultra Novel and Innovative Fully Integrated Engine Demonstrations. The project will develop and integrate advanced propulsion technologies into a next-generation powerplant concept, paving the way for more efficient and lower-emission short-medium range aircraft.

PHARES

PHARES – Powerplant Hybrid Application for Regional Segment – is coordinated by Pratt & Whitney Canada. It combines a turboprop engine derived from the PW127XT with a powerful electric motor and optimised gearbox. The ambition is to cut regional aircraft fuel burn by around 20%, with a consortium that also includes ATR and Collins Aerospace.

DEMETRA

ATR leads DEMETRA, the Demonstrator of an Electrified Modern Efficient Transport Regional Aircraft. The project will create a flight demonstrator as part of ATR’s broader Evo programme, advancing its ambition to deliver hybrid-electric aircraft to the market in the next decade.

OSYRYS

Safran Electrical & Power is behind OSYRYS – On-board SYstems Relevant for hYbridization of Regional aircraftS. The project will focus on developing and testing the electrical systems required to make hybridisation feasible on regional aircraft, from power distribution to thermal management.

CRYOSTAR

CRYOSTAR, led by the Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, will concentrate on the certification roadmap for cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks. By investigating crashworthiness and safety methodologies, it aims to clear a critical regulatory hurdle for hydrogen-powered aviation.

MODABAT

Germany’s Fraunhofer Gesellschaft will run MODABAT – Modular, scalable and technology-Open Design for future Aviation BATteries. This fast-track project will look at ways of designing modular and scalable battery systems that can be adapted for different aviation applications.

POWER4AIR

Spanish SME Skylife Engineering leads POWER4AIR, which targets the challenges of arc fault detection, electromagnetic interference and reliability in high-voltage power electronics. These are essential elements for making electric and hybrid-electric propulsion safe and certifiable.

LIME

French start-up Ascendance Flight Technologies will coordinate LIME – Lithium based Innovation for Modular Energy. The project is expected to explore lithium-based modular energy systems that can be scaled and integrated into aircraft designs.

HERACLES

HERACLES – Hybrid Electric Regional Aircraft Concept for Low EmissionS – is another ATR-led project. Unlike DEMETRA, which is demonstrator-focused, HERACLES will concentrate on conceptual design and environmental assessment of hybrid-electric regional aircraft, providing the analytical foundation for future models.

ACI&I

Finally, Airbus is also responsible for ACI&I, or Short Medium Range – Aircraft Configuration Integration and Impact. This project will examine how various new propulsion and airframe technologies integrate in short- to medium-range aircraft, evaluating the performance and environmental impact of different configurations.

What happens next

Although the projects have been selected, their official launch depends on finalising grant agreements, expected by the end of 2025. Work will formally begin in early 2026, with development efforts running into the latter part of the decade.

The most ambitious undertakings, including PHARES, DEMETRA and TAKE OFF, are aiming for flight testing between 2028 and 2029.

The road ahead is steep. Hybrid-electric propulsion introduces complex systems integration and certification questions, hydrogen storage requires entirely new safety standards, and advanced batteries must meet aviation’s uncompromising performance and reliability demands. By pooling public funding, industrial expertise and fresh thinking from smaller players, Clean Aviation hopes to overcome these hurdles.

If the programme delivers on its ambitions, Europe could see the first genuinely climate-friendly regional and short-medium range aircraft entering service by 2035. That would not only bring the sector closer to its net-zero targets but also help secure Europe’s place at the forefront of global aerospace innovation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/plane-flight-sky-travel-aircraft-sunset-1575625-pxhere.com_.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:04:00.778600

And who’s going to be there to combat those voices and those negotiating influences?” said Tilvawala, founder and executive director of the global organization Youth Climate Collaborative. “So I was like, ‘We need to be here.’”

With less than two months before this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP30, only about 36% of the 196 participating countries have confirmed attendance and paid for accommodations, according to a spokesperson for the conference presidency.

Activists and poorer nations are feeling the crunch as hotel prices have skyrocketed and even private homes, love motels and other makeshift accommodation options are charging a minimum of several hundred dollars a night.

The Brazilian government chose Belem because it’s part of the Amazon and to underscore the problems common to growing cities in the developing world, but some prospective attendees are raising questions about how productive the talks will be if they are overshadowed by a big drop in attendance.

Many haven’t confirmed housing yet, and the pressure is on

The Brazilian government has taken steps to address the problem. Climate Minister Marina Silva said 10 to 20 rooms have been made available “at accessible prices” for vulnerable countries. The government has also brought in two large cruise ships that can house as many as 6,000 people.

“Everybody will have access to participate in COP30,” Silva said at a recent press briefing. “Facing climate change must be done by all of us, by all the parties of the convention and especially by those who are already living the consequences of climate change.”

But U.N. Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell sent a letter on Sept. 9 asking that agencies in the U.N. system, and related organizations, review how many people they’re sending to COP30 and reduce it where possible.

To add to the pressure, a construction workers’ strike started Sept. 15 and includes areas being worked on for COP30.

A challenge for a city chosen to illustrate climate realities

Belem was initially excited to host the conference, said Arnaldo Vaz Neto, a Brazilian financial adviser who has been working with an organization called the Young Scholars Initiative as an intermediary between locals and COP30 visitors seeking housing. “It’s kind of taught in our childhood to have this behavior of hospitality,” he said.

But that was followed by the realization that the United Nations had high international standards for its guests. It was difficult to manage expectations on both sides, Vaz Neto said.

Belem isn’t the only city hosting a U.N. climate conference where lodging rates have gone far higher than usual. Silva said it’s happened at nearly all such conferences, with prices three or even four times market rates.

“A lot of people here are expecting to charge $1,000 a night but that’s beyond the average,” Hugo Pinheiro, a secretary who works for K Pine Mobile in Belem, and has worked to match delegations with housing and to negotiate on prices.

The “accessible” rooms made available by the Brazilian government will rent for between $200 and $600 a night, according to a COP30 presidency spokesperson.

Brazilian officials have expressed confidence that all 196 nations will find housing and come to Belem. In a statement, the presidency said it expects 50,000 participants and Belem currently offers 53,000 beds. That’s fewer people than recent COPs, even though the Brazil meeting is considered one of the most important negotiations in years because countries have to update and strengthen their carbon pollution plans.

Hard decisions

Still, housing is making it more difficult for people from some poorer countries and Indigenous groups to attend, as well as for those that traditionally attend COP outside of a country delegation, including activists, NGO and nonprofit groups and youth observers. Some organizations that represent them expect to send fewer people.

Hailey Campbell leads Care About Climate, a youth-oriented NGO that was one of the first of its kind to be accredited to attend COP over 10 years ago. Campbell said her group has “never faced such difficulties with access to accommodation.” The group posted about the issue on Instagram with the hashtag “#DontPriceUsOut.”

Many individual attendees have already decided they can’t come. Others are on the fence. Some who will attend are considering options like camping in a tent.

This year Hikaru Hayakawa said he’s heard from more people who have decided not to go than he remembers at this time in years past — already maybe 30 or 40 people, by his estimate.

That’s worrisome because many activists from other countries will now miss out on experiencing the strong civil society culture in Brazil, said Hayakawa, executive director of Climate Cardinals, which translates climate information and trains young people.

“It could potentially be lost opportunity to build these global networks,” he said.

As the energy sector grapples with shifting regulatory frameworks, surging demand for clean power, and the electrification of industries like data centers, NRG's pivot to renewables and

raises a critical question: Is the company's stock undervalued relative to its growth potential?

Financial Resilience Amid Transition

NRG's Q2 2025 financial results underscore its operational resilience. Despite a GAAP net loss of $104 million, the company reported Adjusted Net Income of $339 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $909 million, reaffirming its 2025 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA ($3.875–$4.025 billion) and Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments (FCFbG) of $2.1–$2.25 billion NRG Energy, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results and Reaffirms 2025 Financial Guidance[ 1 ]. This performance reflects NRG's ability to balance near-term challenges—such as market volatility and operational costs—with long-term strategic gains.

The company's capital allocation strategy further strengthens its financial profile. Through $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $345 million in dividends in 2025,

As of July 31, 2025, it had already repurchased $768 million in shares and distributed $173 million in dividends NRG Energy, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results and Reaffirms 2025 Financial Guidance[ 1 ]. This dual focus on returns and reinvestment positions NRG to navigate the capital-intensive nature of the energy transition.

Strategic Moves in Renewables and Grid Services

NRG's most transformative initiative is the $12 billion acquisition of LS Power's generation portfolio, which nearly doubled its capacity to 50 GW and diversified its energy mix with wind, solar, and storage assets NRG Energy: Strategic Capacity Doubling & Emerging Market Focus[ 2 ]. This move aligns with the projected 15% CAGR in data center energy demand through 2030, a sector where NRG has secured a 500 MW multi-year contract in Texas, set to begin operations in Q4 2026 NRG Energy: Strategic Capacity Doubling & Emerging Market Focus[ 2 ].

These initiatives not only diversify revenue streams but also position NRG as a critical infrastructure provider for a decarbonizing economy.

Valuation Metrics: Undervalued or Overpriced?

NRG's valuation metrics present a nuanced picture. The stock trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 74.86 and a forward P/E of 20.95, significantly higher than the U.S. renewable energy industry's average P/E of 41.4x U.S. Renewable Energy Industry Analysis - Simply Wall St[ 4 ]. Meanwhile, its EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.92 exceeds the sector's 11.1x average Key Valuation Multiples in Renewable Energy Deals[ 5 ]. At first glance, these multiples suggest the stock is overvalued. However, analysts argue that NRG's growth trajectory justifies the premium.

A consensus of 20 analyst estimates, as of September 2025, assigns a 12-month price target of $173.06—7.03% above the current price of $164.36—with a “Strong Buy” rating NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) Stock Valuation, Peer Comparison[ 6 ]. The wide range of targets ($92–$203) reflects diverging views on macroeconomic risks, such as interest rate volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Yet, NRG's 5-year EPS growth forecast of 21.02% and its recent guidance raises (e.g., $100 million midpoint increase in Adjusted Net Income) suggest strong earnings momentum NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) Stock Valuation, Peer Comparison[ 6 ].

Industry Context and Risks

The broader renewable energy sector has seen valuation normalization since 2020, with EV/EBITDA multiples declining from 18.2x to 11.1x Key Valuation Multiples in Renewable Energy Deals[ 5 ]. This trend reflects higher capital costs and policy shifts, such as the Trump administration's reversal of Biden-era clean energy incentives. However, NRG's diversified portfolio—spanning generation, storage, and grid services—offers resilience against sector-specific headwinds.

Key risks include its debt-to-equity ratio of 4.86, which could constrain flexibility during economic downturns NRG Energy (NRG) Statistics & Valuation - Stock Analysis[ 7 ]. Additionally, the success of its data center contracts and VPP initiatives hinges on execution risks, such as permitting delays or technological bottlenecks.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Bet

NRG Energy's strategic pivot to renewables and energy services positions it to capitalize on the U.S. energy transition's structural tailwinds. While its valuation metrics appear elevated relative to industry averages, the company's earnings growth, capital discipline, and innovative grid solutions justify a premium.

There is a vast farmland here in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), with each farmer specializing in crops they’ve been growing and harvesting for generations. Whether its leafy greens, exotic fruits, sweet corn, green beans, sugarcane or rice, there is one thing all farmers in the EAA share in common — our commitment to being mindful stewards of the land and water.

Last month, the South Florida Water Management District announced EAA farmers this year achieved a 62% annual phosphorus reduction, which is more than double the 25% reduction required under Florida’s 1996 Everglades Forever Act.

EAA farmers are among the most regulated in the country. With the EAA being one of the most fertile farmlands in the United States, farmers make sure to treat the land and water with great care so it stays this way. We want to protect our way of life and preserve family legacies for generations to come.

Since the program began three decades ago, EAA farmers’ clean water efforts have averaged a 57% annual reduction. We accomplish this by implementing best management practices (BMPs) and cutting-edge innovation to promote healthier water and soil.

On our farm in Belle Glade, we have worked to feed our family, local community and customers around the country for over 40 years. We grow a variety of wholesome foods including sweet corn, rice, lettuce and other leafy greens, including parsley and cilantro.

We practice sustainability every day at our farm. We’ve integrated a number of practices, including employing a balanced crop rotation program, which is a foundational piece of the BMP program, along with soil preservation techniques such as sediment control to promote regenerative soil, and regular soil testing to ensure nutritional inputs are appropriate for our crops. To preserve water quality and minimize water use, we use strategies such as ditch bank stabilization, land leveling, and water retention systems to capture and reuse rainfall effectively.

I believe that when food is grown with real dedication, care and a commitment to the land, you can taste the difference.

EAA farmers are proud to celebrate this milestone, demonstrating a 30-year commitment to sustainability, which has resulted in the removal of thousands of metric tons of phosphorus in the water since the program began.

We look forward to extending this commitment to our soil, our water and our land, for many decades to come.

Similar debates are underway in Virginia and other states where data centers have multiplied.","America's largest tech companies are transforming the country's power grid at breakneck speed — and everyday people may be paying the price.

As tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google race to build energy-hungry data centers, utilities are saying that the billions needed for new power plants and grid upgrades could drive up bills for residents and small businesses.

What's happening?

Driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, the number of massive data centers across the country is soaring. These facilities now consume more than 4% of the nation's electricity, with analysts warning that figure could triple to 12% in just three years.

To keep pace, utilities are being asked to spend billions on new power plants and grid upgrades. Those costs are traditionally passed on to everyone, meaning residents and small businesses could see higher bills even if they aren't using more energy, according to a report from The New York Times. In Ohio, households are already paying about $15 more per month because of data centers.

Why are data centers concerning?

Nationally, electricity rates for residents have already jumped more than 30% since 2020, and experts say data center demand could supercharge those increases. A joint study from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State projects that average household power bills could rise by another 8% by 2030 — and even more than 25% in states like Virginia, where data centers are proliferating.

Regulators warn that utilities are being pushed into ""extremely new territory,"" with projects being greenlit faster and on a larger scale than ever before. Consumer advocates are worried that homes and small businesses will be stuck paying for Big Tech's massive expansion. ""Our wallets cannot be strained anymore,"" wrote one resident to state regulators, per the Times. ""Make them pay their own bills like we do!""

What's being done to protect everyday consumers?

Some regulators are pushing back. Ohio recently ruled unanimously against a proposal from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that would have shifted more costs onto regular folks, instead requiring data centers to cover a larger share of their own expenses. Similar debates are underway in Virginia and other states where data centers have multiplied.

At the same time, companies like Amazon argue they are investing in renewable power and efficiency, including electric delivery vans and wind and solar farms. Still, those efforts may be overshadowed by the immense energy demand.

For consumers, watchdog groups recommend staying engaged with local authorities and supporting policies that ensure large corporate users pay their fair share. On a personal level, adopting energy-efficiency upgrades at home could help offset rising costs. Even so, the larger battle will depend on whether regulators hold Big Tech accountable for the true cost of its growth.

But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".","GOTO, Japan: Close to a small fishing port in southwestern Japan, the slim white turbines of the country's first commercial-scale floating wind farm glimmer offshore, months before a key project in Tokyo's green-energy strategy begins.

Still heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels, Japan has declared offshore wind energy a ""trump card"" in its drive to make renewables its top power source by 2040, and reach carbon neutrality a decade later.

That's despite rising project costs and fears over inadequate infrastructure to produce turbines en masse.

Floating turbines are particularly well suited to Japan as its deep coastal waters make fixing them to seabeds tricky, while the country is also prone to natural disasters.

""Floating structures are relatively stable even in the case of earthquakes or typhoons,"" said Kei Ushigami, head of marine renewable energy for construction company Toda, a key player in the project.

The eight turbines, sitting 5km off the coast of the Goto Islands in waters up to 140m deep, will officially start turning in January.

It's hoped they'll aid the archipelago in reaching ambitious new targets laid out this year that should see wind's contribution to the energy mix soar to between four and eight per cent by 2040, up from around one per cent today.

But it's a long, hard road ahead for resource-scarce Japan - the world's fifth-largest carbon dioxide emitter - to wean itself off fossil fuels.

In 2024, 65 percent of its electricity needs were met by coal and hydrocarbon-powered thermal plants, while just over a quarter came from renewables, according to Japan's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies.

HERCULEAN TASK

Costs are also rising sharply, and at the end of August Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi pulled out of three key wind power projects deemed no longer profitable.

Other project operators have asked for better support from the government.

""It is important for the government to address shortcomings in the current bidding system, which failed to anticipate rapid global inflation after bids were awarded,"" said Yoko Mulholland from the think tank E3G.

The streamlining of regulatory processes and easing construction restrictions would ""shorten lead times and also lower capital expenditure"", she told AFP.

Hidenori Yonekura, from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, sees the nascent floating wind energy as a path to eventually lower costs, by installing more turbines in Japan's vast Exclusive Economic Zone of 4.5 million square kilometres.

The task, however, appears Herculean: to meet the 2040 wind target, around 200 15-megawatt turbines a year need to go up.

But ""the infrastructure is not yet in place"", warned Yonekura. ""Japan lacks turbine manufacturers and large production sites.""

FISHERS' LIVELIHOODS

Construction companies also face technical challenges with these still-novel systems: defects discovered in the floating structure of a wind turbine at Goto meant Toda had to make replacements, delaying the project by two years.

Coexistence with local industries, especially fishing, is also crucial.

Toda said it had conducted an environmental assessment and found a pilot project had ""no negative impact on fish"".

Fishermen also receive part of the revenue from electricity sales and some of the property taxes generated by the project, while some have been hired to monitor the construction site with their vessels.

But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".

Nevertheless, ""fishermen understand the importance of such a project for Japan"", he said.

The National Federation of Fisheries Co-operative Associations protested to the government after Mitsubishi withdrew, reminding them that fishermen had worked with these projects, hoping for positive economic impacts.

As fishing becomes less viable owing to warming sea temperatures, ""some hope their children or grandchildren will find jobs in wind turbine maintenance"", said Eashiro.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--0i4eQ_EP--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/09/21/000_68xh3x3.jpg?itok=N8haSEgM",N,,2025-09-21 10:59:11.574696

Key Takeaway Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger.","A Nuclear Surge Ignites Investor Frenzy

On Friday, shares of Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) and NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) blasted over 20% higher, electrified by the U.S.-U.K. Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, signed ahead of President Trump’s recent London visit.

This game-changing deal aligns the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the U.K.’s regulator, reducing SMR licensing timelines from about three to four years to roughly two years. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright — a former fossil fuels executive — called it a “nuclear renaissance” and plans similar pacts with Poland, Romania, and others to power AI data centers and end Russian nuclear material reliance by 2028.

The agreement unlocks billions of dollars for SMR projects, like U.K. data centers in Nottinghamshire. With Oklo skyrocketing 537% year-to-date and NuScale up 160% in 2025, investors are wondering if these nuclear stocks are still a buy, or has the uranium train left the station?

Oklo (OKLO)

Oklo is a Santa Clara startup founded in 2013 by MIT alumni Jacob and Caroline DeWitte that is redefining nuclear power with its Aurora microreactors. These 15 to 50 megawatt electrical (MWe) fast-fission units — that are scalable to 100 MWe — run on recycled nuclear waste, offering meltdown-proof safety, passive cooling, and a 10-year fuel cycle.

Targeting off-grid clients such as data centers, military bases, and remote communities, Oklo sells power via long-term contracts, not reactors, and produces radioisotopes as a bonus. Backed by Sam Altman, Oklo has secured strategic partnerships with companies like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) for data center power and is prepping a 2027 debut in Idaho.

The U.S.-U.K. deal easing licensing requirements sparked Friday’s 28.8% surge to $135.23 per share by promising faster Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval — Oklo was denied a combined license for its Aurora microreactor in 2022 — and European pilots. Oklo’s 537% YTD gain reflects AI energy demand, its February Atomic Alchemy acquisition for isotope tech, and Trump’s May executive orders to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Yet, because Oklo is pre-revenue with a $30.7 million cash burn against guidance for $65 million to $80 million in annual cash use, Oklo’s $20 billion market valuation is a bet on execution. Because it is trading on its potential rather than operational performance, it is best-suited for risk-tolerant investors. Dips below $100 per share could yield 50% to 100% upside if global SMR deals materialize, but expect a volatile ride getting there.

NuScale Power (SMR)

NuScale Power leads the SMR race with its VOYGR plants that are 77 MWe modules scalable up to 924 MWe per plant. As the only NRC-certified SMR design since 2022, NuScale’s factory-built approach cuts costs for utilities, industrials, and hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google.

NuScale’s compact reactors are just 65 feet tall and use simplified pressurized water systems, reducing construction timelines and risks compared to traditional plants. Its 2025 wins include Romania’s Doicesti plant, where it will help deliver 462 MW of installed capacity, a 6 gigawatt (GW) Tennessee Valley Authority deal, partnering with ENTRA1 to commercialize its SMR technology inside ENTRA1’s power plants, and talks for a Polish project by 2029.

The U.S.-U.K. pact drove Friday’s 22% jump to $46.77 per share, bringing it within 12% of its all-time high of $53.50 per share hit in July. Its 160% YTD surge ties to revenue in Q2 that surged to $8.1 million from $1 million a year ago, DOE’s $400 million SMR funding, and AI hype.

Because NuScale is the only NRC-certified SMR operator and has a global pipeline, it provides the nuclear stock with a wide competitive moat, making SMR a strong buy. At almost $47 per share, it’s undervalued with 30% to 50% upside on international deployments, meaning you haven’t missed out on the opportunity to have your portfolio radiate stellar gains.

Key Takeaway

Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger. Supply chain risks and fuel costs linger, but Secretary Wright’s global push signals a trillion-dollar SMR market. These stocks still have room to glow for bold investors.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OKLO-Reactor.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:32.293276

The brand avoids price increases on its electric SUVs and strengthens its presence in the United States.","Toyota surprised by announcing a strategic decision in the U.S. automotive market. The Japanese manufacturer will produce two new electric vehicle models in the country. This move aims to reduce costs and avoid the effects of tariffs.

This move takes place in a context of trade tensions. Donald Trump's policies imposed a 25% tax on cars manufactured abroad. Now Toyota is speeding up the production transition within the United States.

Two new electric vehicles will be manufactured in the United States

The stars of this announcement will be the electric versions of the RAV4 and Land Cruiser. Both models are brand benchmarks and will have three rows of seats, reinforcing their profile as family vehicles. The strategy aims to keep the essence of the best-selling SUVs, but with a sustainable focus.

The production of these models will be concentrated at the Georgetown, Kentucky plant. In addition, Toyota is strategically reorganizing its capacity at the Kentucky and Indiana plants. This opens the door to more future announcements about new vehicles manufactured in the United States.

The decision also secures jobs in Kentucky. The factory had lost workload after the next-generation Lexus ES returned to Japan in 2021. With these new models, Toyota strengthens its commitment to local employment and to an increasingly competitive market.

A direct response to tariffs

The strategy is part of a broader move among manufacturers. The Trump administration imposed tariffs with the intention of forcing brands to produce on U.S. soil. General Motors, Honda, and BMW had already announced similar plans to strengthen their domestic manufacturing.

Those who didn't adapt passed the costs on to consumers. In fact, Ford raised prices by two thousand euros on vehicles produced in Mexico. Meanwhile, Volkswagen and Subaru also applied considerable percentage increases to several of their models.

The effect on the market has multiplied. Used car prices remain high after the semiconductor crisis between 2020 and 2023. The shortage of new models reduced the supply of second-hand vehicles and raised repair costs, with an 8.5% (8.5%) increase in September.

Consumers bear the bill

Analysts warn that tariffs will keep pushing prices up. Michael DeLong, from the U.S. Consumers Federation, pointed out that the taxes don't benefit the buyer. According to him, costs are rising in all segments, including cars imported by individuals.

There is no shortage of examples. An Arizona resident had to pay six thousand euros just to re-enter the country with his own car. In addition, insurers project a nationwide increase of at least 8% in premiums for 2025, reaching up to 13% in some states.

In this context, Toyota's strategy is not only industrial but also competitive. The brand avoids price increases on its electric SUVs and strengthens its presence in the United States. The move aims to secure customers who increasingly value cost stability in a volatile market.",https://estoesatleti.es/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/toyota-coche-estados-unidos_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-09-21 10:59:50.279020

The partnership merges Emobi’s patented JustPlug technology with ElectricFish’s microgrid-scale energy storage and fast charging systems. Together, they address two of the biggest barriers to EV adoption — charging speed and grid infrastructure limitations.

Emobi’s JustPlug technology enables 80% of existing EVs and chargers—lacking native Plug & Charge features—to access seamless automatic charging. It also strengthens security with encryption and certificate authentication.

ElectricFish’s 350Squared system delivers 133% faster charging than traditional hardware while reducing grid upgrade costs by up to 90% through advanced power electronics and battery integration.

Traditional EV charger installations often face delays of up to two years and costs exceeding $100,000 due to required grid upgrades. The Emobi and ElectricFish partnership removes these barriers by enabling grid-independent fast charging. Operators gain interoperability, enhanced security, and the ability to offer Plug & Charge capabilities without costly hardware replacement, the companies said.

Leaders Emphasize the Future of EV Charging

“This partnership exemplifies our commitment to future-proofing EV infrastructure as we expand beyond public charging into fleet charging depots,” said Lin Sun Fa, CEO of Emobi. “ElectricFish’s approach to solving grid constraints complements our JustPlug technology’s ability to eliminate compatibility barriers across both public and fleet use cases. The same protocols we use today for JustPlug will also power Vehicle-to-Grid communication.”

“ElectricFish is transforming the EV charging experience by delivering the speed, reliability, and convenience drivers expect. Without the delays and costs of grid upgrades,” said Anurag Kamal, CEO of ElectricFish. “By partnering with Emobi, we’re enabling public and fleet drivers to plug in and power up in minutes.”

So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

""There is still time, but the clock is ticking,"" said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

WHAT ARE THESE TAX INCENTIVES?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

WHEN ARE THE CREDITS EXPIRING?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that ""as soon as you hear this message.""

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. ""You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,"" she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

WHAT SHOULD I PRIORITIZE FOR MY HOME?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

""That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,"" she said. ""Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.""

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

""We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn't mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,"" Pierce said.

""Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that's quick,"" said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. ""You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it's even possible.""

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

WHAT IF TAX CREDITS EXCEED WHAT I OWE?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects -- think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage -- could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

The PUC could also facilitate rate assistance programs requiring companies to help low-income residents afford their energy bills, Marx said.","When Pennsylvania state Sen. Katie Muth toured a small data center in her suburban Philadelphia district this May, she was mostly impressed by what she found. It was quiet and impeccably clean–a largely unintrusive presence even in a wealthy enclave where some of the closest neighbors live in million-dollar homes. But in one corner of the facility, Muth found the source of growing concern in the state.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

""The engineer that worked there showed us this cabinet farm that was kind of lightly shaking. It was very warm,"" Muth said. ""And he said it was an AI cabinet farm and that at certain times of the day, this sucker is just revving up.""

The copious amounts of power such AI servers require are already driving up energy bills for consumers in the state. Since her visit, Muth has announced plans to introduce the ""Pennsylvania Ratepayer Protection Act,"" just one of at least a dozen proposed or planned bills in Pennsylvania's legislature addressing the hottest industrial issue in the commonwealth.

Some of the bills aim to further ramp up data center development by modifying permitting and zoning procedures. Other legislation, including a package of bills under the banner of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's ""Lightning Plan,"" seeks to combine permitting reform with policies focused on clean energy and consumer costs.

Whether any of them will find their way through the morass of Pennsylvania's divided government remains to be seen.

Proponents of AI development view the technology's arrival as the dawn of a new industrial era in this resource-rich state, following booms of iron, coal, natural gas and, more recently, e-commerce warehouses. Speaking at a Pennsylvania Senate hearing in August, Merle Madrid, senior manager of public policy for Amazon Web Services, said his company's $20 billion investment in the state would create at least 1,250 new ""high-skilled"" jobs, support thousands of others and provide other benefits to host communities.

""Our investment in the commonwealth isn't just financial, it's also in the people and future of Pennsylvania,"" Madrid said.

Others–such as John Quigley, a former secretary of the state's Department of Environmental Protection and now senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania–view likening AI to major industries of the past as a cautionary tale. The state has a long legacy of unresolved industrial pollution, and some of the economic promises have fallen short.

""Pennsylvania's history is, we roll out the red carpet for every industry, regardless of whether its impacts are known or unknown,"" Quigley said. ""Then we find out later we made a mistake. … I don't see too much indication we're not on the same track.""

Muth is most interested in addressing the state's swiftly rising energy costs, a dynamic playing out across a 13-state territory overseen by electric grid operator PJM Interconnection. Stretching from Chicago to Jersey to eastern North Carolina, it's the nation's largest grid and includes all of Virginia and Pennsylvania, which consulting firm Wood Mackenzie ranks second and third among all states for announced data center development.

On June 1, many Pennsylvanians saw their electricity rates increase between 5 and 12 percent–and some as much as 40 percent–according to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. And more is on the way. Each year, PJM holds ""capacity auctions"" for energy generation, which influence consumer costs by effectively balancing electricity supply against projected demand. Quigley notes that this summer's auction was a record-setting $16 billion, more than seven times the total from just two years ago.

PJM predicts the latest auction will cause energy bills to rise by another 1.5 to 5 percent next year. While the organization says costs are increasing for several reasons, including electrification and regular economic growth, its independent market monitor cites data centers as the primary and ""unprecedented"" cause, accounting for about $9.3 billion of this year's prices.

Muth's upcoming legislation is focused on yet another factor in costs: transmission. New industrial facilities that use copious amounts of electricity, like data centers, often require new power lines and other energy infrastructure to operate. In Pennsylvania, that's the domain of transmission companies like PECO and PPL, which pass along the costs of building new distribution lines to customers.

Muth said her bill is modeled on existing policies in Oregon that require ""high-load"" customers to fully cover the costs of infrastructure created for their benefit.

""I think the general public, all party affiliations, don't want to pay these increased utility bills. They can't afford them,"" Muth said. ""I can remember my own grandmother saying, 'I don't want to turn on the air conditioner because I don't want my electricity bill to go up.' And I hate to think that people have to make those decisions and sit there and suffer.""

But garnering the support of her colleagues will likely prove difficult. The state's politics are increasingly acrimonious: The Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-occupied House and governor's office have butted heads, most recently over a state budget that is now more than two months overdue. Some in the state capital of Harrisburg, such as Elizabeth Marx, executive director of the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, doubt there's much room for compromise.

""I do not see the Pennsylvania General Assembly breaking gridlock on any energy issues anytime soon,"" Marx said. ""While there are some common threads of agreement that we need to protect consumers from increased rates as a result of data centers, there is not agreement on the 'how.'""

Still, others say AI-related legislation is important to track, as it shapes the policy landscape in which a future deal may be forged. And some kind of action may become unavoidable as consumer costs–and anger–rises, said Katie Blume, political and legislative director of the nonprofit advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania.

""We need to socialize these ideas with the legislature, with the public, and we need to make sure that people are brought into conversations who are going to be impacted by these things,"" Blume said. ""And I think the Senate Republicans who always say, 'We don't want to do anything on energy right now,' are going to be in between a rock and a hard place before too long.""

Power Plays

On the surface, there does appear to be at least some common ground among Pennsylvania lawmakers on AI data center development: getting more of it.

In Pittsburgh in early July, U.S. Senator Dave McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, convened an Energy and Innovation Summit that drew both President Donald Trump and Shapiro. All three expressed excitement over what McCormick says is more than $90 billion in investments announced by tech companies in the state.

The legislature has previously found its way to a deal in the space. In 2021, a tax bill that included a measure to strengthen an existing tax credit for purchasing servers and other equipment for large data centers in the state passed with wide bipartisan support. The incentive currently costs the state about $43 million in tax revenue a year, and Shapiro's office projects it will eclipse $50 million annually by the end of the decade. But politicians, including Shapiro himself, have cited it as key to growing the industry in the state, with a spokesperson for the governor telling Spotlight PA that it will ""generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenue for state and local governments.""

Shapiro's Lightning Plan is a package of six bills that, altogether, seek to create a new ""streamlined"" permitting process for key energy projects, create new tax incentives for diverse energy sources, create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, bolster renewable energy and attempt to address energy costs in rural and low-income communities. Although the package does not directly address the buildout of AI data centers, it focuses on spurring new energy generation needed by the power-hungry sector and is similar to some other bills specifically addressing AI.

Many of the Lightning Plan measures, such as the carbon program, are supported by Democratic rank-and-file members seeking effective climate policy. But those focused on permitting reform bear similarities to AI bills introduced by Republicans. Senate Bill 939, introduced by Republican state Sen. Greg Rothman with at least one Democratic co-sponsor, proposes creating a ""Commonwealth Opportunity Zone"" that would create a fast-track permitting process for data centers, as well as a ""regulatory sandbox"" encouraging deregulation.

""This innovative, collaborative framework will enable industry leaders to work directly with state agencies to identify and remove unnecessary and outdated regulations, thereby streamlining the development process and accelerating innovation,"" Rothman's office, which did not respond to inquiries from Inside Climate News, stated in a press release announcing the proposal.

A Republican colleague in the House, Rep. Jason Ortitay, introduced a bill to create a ""Keystone Artificial Intelligence Authority"" to similarly ""streamline and coordinate"" permitting through a new, centralized process. Other Republicans say they are preparing to introduce measures also designed to accelerate data-center permitting and create new tax incentives, with some bipartisan support.

Asked to comment for this story, Shapiro's office touted a focus on permit reform, noting the governor already established an Office of Transformation and Opportunity ""as a one-stop-shop for businesses looking to grow in the Commonwealth."" In 2024, his administration also launched the PA Permit Fast Track Program, which it calls an innovative permitting system to ""expedite major economic development and infrastructure projects,"" including a data center campus in Northeast Pennsylvania.

""Governor Shapiro is laser-focused on getting stuff done and taking real action to lower Pennsylvanians' energy costs through his commonsense, all-of-the-above energy plan to build more power in the Commonwealth, create a more reliable, affordable energy grid, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come,"" his office said in a prepared statement.

Among the points of conflict: Several Harrisburg insiders say Shapiro and Republican Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman are at loggerheads on energy policy over the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program spanning 10 neighboring states. Shapiro's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, joined the program in 2022, but Pennsylvania's participation is tied up in the commonwealth's courts.

Shapiro's administration has defended the initiative in court but has floated PACER–the bill in the Lightning Plan that would create a state-run ""cap-and-invest"" program–as a preferred alternative.

Pittman's office did not respond to requests for comment. But the senator previously told Spotlight PA the pending RGGI case leaves his caucus ""very limited"" in considering energy-related legislation, a dynamic that others say remains the status quo.

A Call From Inside the House

Some of Shapiro's policies also face opposition from members of his own party, particularly RESET, another Lightning Plan bill. The legislation's primary sponsor, state Rep. Mandy Steele, says it would create a ""central cohesive authority"" to approve siting applications for large energy-generating facilities.

Muth said that opposition to the bill from some southeast Pennsylvania Democrats crystallized in June when the House Energy Committee held a hearing on the legislation. A bevy of environmental groups came out against it for fear the new state board could support new fossil fuel infrastructure while local officials objected to losing authority over siting.

The bill has the support of several Democratic committee members, labor organizations and environmental groups. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Nature Conservancy think the board will boost clean energy buildouts.

Muth says she's seen some potential Republican support percolating for the bill, which leads her to believe that deals could be coming, perhaps in next year's budget negotiations, if not in the one still ongoing.

""My fear is we're going to have this dumped into something,"" Muth said. ""It could happen tomorrow.""

Quigley, the energy expert and former DEP secretary, believes that if something does emerge from the legislature, it will likely focus primarily on deregulation and industry incentives, rather than consumer costs or environmental protection. Both the state's powerful natural gas lobby and trade unions support AI development, he notes.

""There's this rush to deregulate, to accommodate this industry that no one is prepared for,"" Quigley said.

State Rep. Greg Vitali, another Southeast Pennsylvania Democrat and chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, is also concerned environmental considerations could be overlooked in the push for more AI and energy to feed it.

He notes that both the cap-and-trade bill PACER, as well as a PRESS bill that would require more renewables to be added to the state's energy mix, have stalled even in the Democratically controlled chamber. The latter bill, he believes, has been held up after fossil fuel lobbyists convinced some House Democrats that a measure diminishing waste coal's status in the energy mix would be harmful.

Vitali adds there's also little to no activity in the House grappling with any climate or environmental harms directly generated by AI data center development. Natural gas may end up powering much of the nation's data-center growth, and many of the tech promises to the contrary are short on details.

""When the governor announces his $20 billion deal with Amazon, you don't hear any discussion of climate impacts. … It just seems to be one of the things people forget about,"" Vitali said. ""I think legislators are discouraged from talking about any issue in terms of climate because it's almost become like a poison pill in anything you want to get through the Senate.""

Quigley says history has shown that ""legislators always play catch-up"" to new industries, and believes that will be the case with AI as well.

""These data centers can potentially use millions of gallons of water a day … and nobody's raised the issue, nobody's planned for it,"" Quigley said, adding that millions of Pennsylvanians rely on groundwater wells for drinking water.

In an email, Amazon Web Services says its company is focused on efficiency and sustainability, with ongoing plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and be ""water positive"" by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses.

""Amazon is continually improving water efficiency, using advanced cloud services, such as internet of things technologies, to analyze real time water use, identify and fix leaks, and gain other efficiencies,"" the company said in its statement. ""Amazon is further improving operational efficiency to reduce cooling water use in many facilities for most of the year, instead by relying on outside air.""

Mind Your Ps and Queues

In the absence of legislative action, policies set by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and PJM could have an outsize effect.

The PUC is a quasi-independent state agency whose directors are appointed to terms by the governor. In April, the commission held a hearing about a potential ""model tariff"" on AI data center development, which Marx said could help ensure ""large load"" customers like data centers pay for any transmission costs they generate. The PUC could also facilitate rate assistance programs requiring companies to help low-income residents afford their energy bills, Marx said.

The release of a model tariff is expected soon: PUC spokesperson Dave Hixson told Inside Climate News that the commission is drafting a proposal with a goal to issue it ""in the near future.""

Quigley adds that PJM is also taking steps to consider new policies, including measures that would require data centers to ""bring their own power"" to the grid instead of eating into existing capacity.

""So there's two positive things,"" Quigley said.

Jackson Morris, director of state power sector policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, notes that, like the Pennsylvania legislature, PJM has also been subject to criticism over gridlock. Its new power generation queue remains backed up and renewable energy projects buried. He thinks something will have to give way to the pressures of the new AI paradigm.

""You've literally got governors running for office talking about PJM capacity, market reforms. Two, three years ago, you never heard a governor say the letters PJM,"" Morris said. ""We're not living in that world anymore.""",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/AI_data_centers_PA.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:48.044597

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land.
Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple.
Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike.
""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields.","In 2023, world leaders pledged to triple global renewable energy capacity by the end of this decade at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai. Meeting this goal will require an unprecedented buildout of renewable energy projects, both in speed and in scale. And all of those projects are going to require a whole lot of land, presenting serious challenges for land use strategies.

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land. “Utility-scale solar and wind farms require at least ten times as much space per unit of power as coal- or natural gas–fired power plants, including the land used to produce and transport the fossil fuels,” says a 2022 report from global consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Company. “Wind turbines are often placed half a mile apart, while large solar farms span thousands of acres.”

And, while the vast land tracts that these projects are targeting are undeveloped, it doesn’t mean that they are unused or unpopulated. “These developments often intersect with agricultural zones, conservation areas and Indigenous territories,” explains Renewable Energy Magazine in an article released earlier this year. Plus, the rural areas that have the most undeveloped land are often the most resistant to large-scale renewable energy projects, leading to tense political flare-ups and litigious gridlock that can keep projects tied up in court for years.

Finding land-use agreements that allow for mixed-use plots will be essential to achieving the renewable energy buildout we need without compromising agricultural production, rural livelihoods, and food security. Some farmers have rented out their land to solar developers, but this practice can be risky, with grave consequences for the topsoil. Solar farms, if they clear the land of all vegetation, can create prime conditions for erosion, making that land unsuitable for agriculture more or less permanently. “The reality is that it takes thousands of years to create an inch of fertile topsoil,” warns National Geographic, “but it can be destroyed in minutes.”

But marrying solar power and agriculture on the same land at the same time could provide a win-win for both sectors. The practice, called agrivoltaics, is not a new concept, but it hasn’t reached a commercial scale since its conception in the 1980s. Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple. “A pressing question is how AV technology can maximize crop productivity and energy generation while minimizing plant water loss and irrigation needs,” Phys.org wrote in a 2023 report. “That's a lot to ask for on a piece of land.”

But a new pilot project in Denmark seems to have cracked the code. Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike. ""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields. At the same time, the panels produce electricity in a daily pattern that better matches energy demand. It's a win-win,"" Marta Victoria, lead author of the study and Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering, Aarhus University, told Tech Xplore.

Critically, the solar panels only took up about 10% of the land, allowing for successful metrics from both the agricultural and the photovoltaic sides of the agrivoltaic model. The study, recently published in the scientific journal Energy Nexus, yielded excellent results in full sun as well as with conditions of some shade. ""Even with some shade, the yield per square meter is almost the same. The crops don't seem to mind the presence of solar panels and they like the wind protection that they provide,"" explains Professor Uffe Jørgensen from the Department of Agroecology.

The main reasons behind setting up these facilities are aimed at strengthening the global supply chain for battery manufacturing and storage for electric vehicles (EVs) and supporting emission reduction goals under the Paris Climate Accord.

As per this plan, the giga factories will be located in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Texas, Florida, Kuala Lumpur, Oman, Brazil, UAE, Cambodia, Australia and Nigeria.

They have selected these sites based on renewable energy potential, supportive policies, and market demand.

Each of these facilities will span around 500 acres having an employment potential of up to 100,000 people.

In this deal, the Tesla Group is slated to lead the design, engineering and construction of the plants, while SRAM & MRAM Group will be responsible for securing approvals, subsidies, tax incentives and local partnerships.

A Game-changer For Global Clean Energy Transition

The President of Tesla Group, Nanda K. Bhagi said, “This partnership is a game-changer for the global clean energy transition. By combining our advanced BESS technology with SRAM’s global expertise, we are not only building factories but also fostering vibrant communities that will drive the future of sustainable energy.”

This collaboration would catalyse renewable energy development across multiple markets, said Sailesh L. Hiranandani, the Chairman of SRAM & MRAM Group.

Further adding, “Our expertise in technology, healthcare, and global operations will catalyse innovation in renewable energy and biotechnology, creating jobs, advancing technology, and delivering economic benefits across 20 nations.”

These upcoming five giga factories will align with the country’s net-zero target for 2070 and the government’s focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency and hydrogen-based initiatives.

The group, which released a framework for infrastructure that eventually became law under the Biden Administration, has released a new policy plan — this time an approach to permitting reform that they think has a chance of getting through Congress.

“One of the things that we've been trying to get rolling in our group is the generation of two-party solutions on some key areas that we think are going to determine the success or failure of our country over the next decade,” said co-chair Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania. “Energy and permitting reform is at the top of that list.”

Colorado GOP Rep. Gabe Evans co-led the working group that developed the framework with California Rep. Scott Peters.

Evans said they had one goal in mind: to streamline the process to get new energy projects — from fossil fuels to renewables — up and running faster.

“We have to make sure that we can navigate our own regulatory environment to be able to build these things here in the United States with some of the best and most environmentally and socially responsible guidelines, really anywhere on the planet,” said Evans.

The framework includes five key goals, starting with cutting red tape and depoliticizing the permitting process. It also seeks to meet the nation’s fast-growing energy demand, reform NEPA requirements, set clear and enforceable permitting deadlines and strengthen domestic supply chains.

Peters noted that other legislators have been introducing bills aimed at many of these goals, including one from the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee called the SPEED Act, which reforms NEPA. “I think ultimately this probably all comes together as a big package, because everyone wants to make sure they’re covered.”

Evans added that having a framework, as opposed to lawmakers introducing specific bills, allows for “greater flexibility to be able to work with all the different stakeholder groups to make sure that we’re getting that input early, that we’re getting that buy-in earlier on.”

This approach, he added, also helps ensure there is a large coalition to support getting the permitting reform package through Congress, where it will need backing from members in both parties to garner the minimum 60 votes to pass the Senate.

The Problem Solvers Caucus pointed out that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law started out just like this.

“Started as a framework, then became a bill. Got endorsed by the group, and it was ultimately a bipartisan coalition that got it over the finish line,” said Fitzpatrick. “And our country is better for that bill. We hope this can be following in those footsteps.”

The group has an aggressive timeline. The SPEED Act could hit the House floor by the end of the year and the group is hopeful they can get a package together by then. One bill they mentioned for inclusion in the package, and that meets the guidelines of the framework, is a Senate permitting reform bill introduced in the last Congress by Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.

Among other things, that bill, the Energy Permitting Reform Act, proposed shortening timelines on litigation for projects, provided two pathways for transmission development and accelerated leasing and permitting decisions for all types of energy projects.

Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.
Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms.
So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.
The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.","Dust storms have always swirled through parts of North America, but they are becoming more unexpected and destructive and landing in places unfamiliar with the danger, scientists warn.

In May 2023, a dust storm stalled over parts of central Illinois, disorienting more than 80 motorists on Interstate 55 who crashed into each other, leaving eight people dead and 37 hospitalized. In March this year, Kansas found itself swallowed in a dusty rush of wind that covered Interstate 70, killing eight people in a 71-car pileup. A few months later, Chicago was engulfed by its first torrent of throat-choking dust since 1985. No one was injured in that May storm but visibility was near zero for hours.

In all these cases, the dustups followed a similar script. Thunderstorm winds churned up soil from plowed-open fields and carried it for a short distance. Dust billowed violently, giving people little warning. Scientists from the region are now reviewing and pursuing research to consider whether the ruptures are the start of a new normal for parts of the Midwest.

Agriculture practices have been slow to adapt or anticipate the risks of climate change and particularly droughts, some studies have shown. Dry-tilled fields, notably before spring plantings, are vulnerable to more intense seasonal winds. Kansas knows from history the wreckage of harsh and relentless gusts. A hundred years ago, parts of the Plains states lived through the disastrous Dust Bowl before agricultural irrigation and adaptations were in place.

Will this generation, across the Midwest, have to reckon with a new dust risk rooted in climate change?

Drivers of Dust

Both 2023 and 2025 storms in Illinois happened early in the growing season. In 2023, the winds swept up dust from open fields, just south of Springfield. As it moved eastward, the wind speed rose to roughly 60 mph. Nearby Interstate 55 was in its path.

Eliot Clay, director of the Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts, lives near Interstate 55. He was worried shortly before the disaster. “I remember a couple days prior noticing how much dust was in the air, like you could see it,” Clay said. “I remember thinking if this wind shifts and it goes from west to east, there is a major interstate right there. And sure enough, all of that happened a couple days later.”

Complex factors caused the Interstate 55 storm, said Jonathan Coppess, director of the Gardner Agriculture Policy Program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and former administrator of the Farm Service Agency at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A cold spring season coincided with drought, creating a lot of dust in the fields. The planting season started late and high winds descended. Then there was a bit of bad luck.

Coppess and a team of researchers from the University of Illinois, Texas A&M University and Cornell University studied the 2023 incident and described how the dust storm crossed I-55 and collided with a tree line—a defense often planted close to highways to prevent dust storms and blizzards.

But there was only one tree line along this part of the highway and it, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of the road for this storm.

“If the wind had come from the other direction, there would have been no accident simply because that windbreak would have worked,” Coppess said. “The most interesting to me is how that clump of trees, which is designed basically as a windbreak, ended up concentrating dust right in the accident spot.”

Thomas E. Gill and a team of colleagues in Texas have calculated that the economic risk of such storms is rising and that the U.S. could be losing around $154.4 billion annually due to wind erosion and dust, according to a review of data from 2017.

That number, which includes losses in agriculture and renewable energy, health costs, car accidents and other factors, was based on the limited data they could gather. Gill, an environmental scientist at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the real toll is likely higher.

Gill is one of the leaders at the Dust Alliance for North America, an inter-university partnership that aims to promote more dust-related research and its practical application across the United States and other countries. The accident in Illinois isn’t the only recent dust storm that caused blinding loss of visibility and car crashes, Gill said.

Accidents increasingly have been recorded across the Great Plains and the Pacific Northwest.

Growing dust storms aren’t necessarily warning of a repeat of the Depression-era tragedy, he said. “Rather than seeing a large wholesale dust bowl over a lot of the plains like happened in the 1930s, you might see a bunch of mini dust bowls here and there in various different states and regions,” said Gill, who has published several studies on atmospheric dust.

The United States has better soil and water protection efforts than a century ago. But, he said, “there’s no question that climate change is one of the major drivers of dust.”

Drought and Gusts

So how does a dust storm erupt?

Air is constantly filled with soil and sand particles that move around, playing a key role in spreading minerals. Plants in North and South America are partly dependent on the dust carried all the way from the Sahara Desert by Atlantic winds. But droughts and strong winds can complicate dust movements, leading to serious harm.

A dust storm is an occurrence that reduces visibility to less than one kilometer, according to the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency that promotes international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics. Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.

Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms. With this initiative, U.N. officials are trying to raise awareness of dust threats and urge more international cooperation.

Dust formation is a mechanical process. It usually happens in two ways, said Barry Baker, a physical research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Air Resources Laboratory.

Wind can make a large dust particle roll on the ground, forming the particles into larger masses. That formation is called a creep.

The other process is called impaction, where the wind is high enough to raise particles off the ground until they fall to earth with calamity. “Whenever it crashes, it throws a bunch of other particles up in the air,” Baker said, “and that then basically cascades more and more and more.”

The increased unpredictable heavy rains and extreme droughts create potential for more dust events, Baker said. These events happen in spring and fall, when the soil is often barren, but now they have started to “even out” throughout the year, he added. So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away.”

— Eliot Clay, Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts

U.S. farmers have protected their soil with cover crops over the years, notably after the 1930s and in recent decades. But strong spring winds have arrived before planting in the past couple of years, not just confusing drivers on Illinois’ interstate but confounding farmers. The quality of soil is at risk.

“The soil is so good [in Illinois] because it had thousands of years of perennial tall grass prairie on it,” said Clay, who represents the 97 soil and water conservation districts in Illinois. “And that system that existed naturally meant we had root systems that were going deep into the ground.”

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away,” Clay said.

Altering the Landscape

Anna Gannet Hallar, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, was part of a research team that in 2020 examined space satellite data of expanded farmland within the Midwest/Great Plains region. They explored how climate change and land use has been “altering the landscape, producing increases in windblown dust.”

Hallar said most observed dust increases were significant, linked to land being tilled more often. The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.

“We saw doubling [of dust in the air] over 20 years, and we were able to show that that doubling was associated with changes in land use,” Hallar said.

Evan Thaler, a soil health researcher at Oregon State University, said 30 percent of the top-level soil in the Midwest has been lost. “What’s driving the majority of erosion across the landscape is just the mechanical movement of soil by people plowing over and over and over,” Thaler said. “If we’re tilling a lot, it makes the soil susceptible to any type of erosion.”

As the climate crisis accelerates across the planet, it creates conditions for multiyear droughts in many regions, including the United States. Such droughts endanger both plants and soil—which simply doesn’t have enough time to regenerate. Some multiyear droughts turn into megadroughts—among the most severe in centuries.

The U.S. Southwest is currently going through its most intense megadrought in 1,200 years.

Zack Leasor, director of the Missouri Climate Center at the University of Missouri and the state climatologist, said multiyear droughts can lead to much more devastating effects than a one-time event. It takes time for water reservoirs, plants and industry to recover. With a year-after-year drought, they get no break, he explained.

After the Dust Bowl, the Great Plains agriculture industry recovered and relies now on irrigation from underground water sources, Leasor said. That irrigation system helps confront droughts, but the increasing number of megadroughts as climate change worsens will test that adaptation, Leasor warned.

“While groundwater can be kind of a Band-Aid to get you through a drought, it can also turn into a long-term water supply problem,” Leasor said. Groundwater is used up much faster than it can be replenished, he said, and repetitive drought lets less and less moisture from rain reach down into natural underground reservoirs.

While existing irrigation technologies can help, they aren’t going to solve the growing drought problems, Leasor said.

Gill and his research colleagues, meanwhile, found that human casualties from dust storms are roughly on the same level as casualties from hurricanes, thunderstorms or wildfires. Frequently that’s happened in deserts and farm country—places that don’t receive a lot of press coverage.

“A lot of the deleterious effects of dust, of the casualties, as you say, caused by dust, are out of sight, out of mind,” Gill said. “I don’t think we yet really understand or realize as a society in the United States the full risks that dust poses.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/WFO-Chicago.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 08:00:06.675962

Wind farms are becoming more common in Indiana. The state already boasts the fourth largest ""farm"" in the U.S. and produces more than 3,500 megawatts of wind energy.

The towering windmills reaching up to the sky produced 10% of all the electricity used in the state in 2023. That's enough to power more than 1 million homes, according to the American Clean Power Association.

With more projects in the works, wind power is likely to continue to grow across the state. And with the increasing presence of the conspicuous energy generators comes some curiosity.

So, for this edition of Scrub Hub, we chose a question from Teresa, who asked: Why are the wind turbines not turning right now?

It’s possible for the blades on wind turbines to reach up to speeds of 200 mph, so it may seem odd when some are spinning very quickly while the blades on others nearby are not moving.

We dug around in some state, federal and industry reports and reached out to academic experts in energy technology to determine why some turbines in a wind farm spin while others remain still.

Short Answer: The turbine is down for maintenance

Wind turbines, like all machines, need both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. In some instances that explains why some are operating but not others.

The basic components of a wind turbine are the visible tower and rotor blades, as well as the gearbox and generator located at the top of the tower.

Scheduled maintenance helps prevent wear and tear from breaking parts and unscheduled maintenance occurs when the turbine experiences any of a number of failures.

Regular preventative maintenance can include periodic equipment inspection, oil and filter changes, calibration and adjustment of various parts, as well as replacing brake pads and seals. General housekeeping and blade cleaning can also temporarily keep a turbine from spinning.

In larger wind farms, several turbines on a circuit can be inoperable and not spinning because they are all down for maintenance, said John Roudebush, program chair of Ivy Tech College’s Energy Technology program.

Long answer: Curtailment, congestion and wind speed

Energy transmission in Indiana is run through the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, commonly known as MISO. The group manages the flow of electricity by balancing demand versus what’s being generated, which means there are times where excess electricity is being produced.

“(Sometimes) we don’t need the power as demand is down or another power plant is selling power to the customers instead,” Roudebush wrote in an email. “Power plants compete on the grid. A coal plant, a natural gas plant, or a wind farm will all bid to sell power during some part of the day and MISO will pick the cheapest bid for the day. Generally, wind is the cheapest but not always.”

John Hall, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo’s Engineering and Applied Sciences, focuses his research on the technical aspects of wind energy. While some wind turbines will operate normally, he said others may be stopped to match production with grid demand.

“Basically, you have the utility company distributing power and buying and selling in real time,” Hall said. “Based on how much they need, wind farms would turn turbines off accordingly.”

The industry calls a wind turbine that is not spinning “parked,” Hall said, and this is done with a braking system that holds the rotor in place. Once energy demand rises, the brake is released and almost immediately the turbine starts delivering electricity to the grid again.

Another obvious answer to why the turbines may not be spinning is that the wind speed is not high enough.

Generally, turbines can generate power with wind speeds as low as 5 mph. If speeds fall below that, there just isn’t enough to turn the sometimes massive blades.

On the other hand, wind that is too fast can cause damage to the turbines, so operators of wind farms will park the rotors until the wind calms down. Turbines generally shut down when wind speeds hit about 55 mph.

“The system is not designed for that, so they shut it down,” Hall said. “That’s OK because we rarely get winds over that speed, and it would not be worthwhile to design for that for the few instances.”

To help improve the efficiency of wind farms, Hall said banking excess power is a huge research area right now.

“There are studies on new battery technology and super capacitors and different ways to get around that issue,” Hall said.

Another solution for storing excess electricity is by making hydrogen, Hall said. Wind farm operators would be able to create hydrogen and store it for use later when the grid demand increases.

While fossil fuel plants may be more responsive to the constantly moving supply and demand for electricity, Hall said the future depends on renewables.

""If folks are concerned about climate and want a better future for the next generation and everything, renewable energy like wind and hydro-electric and tidal power are all really not just sources of energy but vital to perhaps our existence,"" Hall said.

The Nevada Independent is continuing to report on the state’s battery industry.
What Tesla got changed Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan.","Tesla successfully fended off proposed environmental regulations in Nevada late last year that would have applied more stringent rules on its battery production operations, according to records obtained by The Nevada Independent.

As the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) sought to create a new regulatory framework governing an array of hazardous materials, the company pushed back — and quickly got its way.

Tesla, which builds battery packs and energy-storage products at its massive Gigafactory east of Reno, argued that regulations proposed by NDEP staff would threaten Nevada’s leading position in a nascent industry that is crucial to diversifying the state’s economy beyond gaming and tourism. The proposed rules would put Nevada “at a disadvantage when competing with other states to grow the lithium-ion battery recycling industry,” a Tesla executive wrote to NDEP in a late October letter.

The proposals would have required companies including Tesla to obtain more onerous permits (which require ongoing compliance reports and could lead to federally mandated spill cleanups but are generally not required for recycling facilities) for certain operations. It also would have required companies to continue following more stringent federal waste regulations related to the handling of hazardous materials, which include scrap metals or sludges that can be ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic.

Two days after Tesla wrote NDEP, the company’s lobbyist sent the same letter to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office, which four days later participated in a meeting with officials from NDEP, Tesla and Redwood Materials, a Northern Nevada battery recycling company started by a co-founder of Tesla. One day after the meeting, held in the governor’s chief of staff’s office and on Microsoft Teams, an updated version of the regulation was sent by NDEP to participants with everything Tesla had asked for in the letter.

“Thank you very much for actioning the industry feedback so swiftly,” a Tesla official emailed the day after receiving the updated regulation.

A panel of state lawmakers later adopted the new rules without controversy.

The previously unreported series of events, revealed in documents obtained from the governor’s office through a public records request, brings into question the role battery companies should have in developing environmental regulations that are designed to keep workers, the public and the environment safe.

Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Its Nevada lobbyist told The Indy in an email that the company does not comment on media inquiries “as a general rule.”

The governor’s office said in a statement that it “has focused on streamlining regulations and implementing regulations that simultaneously support industry safety standards and pro-business policies,” and that it “regularly works” with industry associations and state agencies to shape regulations.

In an interview with The Indy, NDEP officials said that the governor’s office has no defined role in the regulatory process, but it sometimes is involved.

“Because of the growth of this economic sector, they’re interested in what’s going on,” NDEP Administrator Jennifer Carr said. “The governor’s office did not get involved in our process. … We never feel pressure to do anything from the governor's office.”

State agencies typically oversee the regulatory process, but on rare occasions, the process can involve the governor’s office, according to a former high-ranking state official granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal state regulatory dynamics. However, the source noted it is uncommon for a company to immediately get what it wanted from state officials, and that more back-and-forth could have occurred outside of what the public records revealed.

The governor’s office declined to make Lombardo’s chief of staff or its liaison to NDEP available for an interview, but it did respond to The Indy’s written request for comment.

NDEP received almost 70 comments regarding the proposed regulations, which the agency replied to as part of the normal regulation process. Agency officials told The Indy that it did not intend to make its rules more stringent than federal ones, but realized it had done so after meeting with industry officials.

Similar to many other businesses, Tesla has contracted with a lobbying firm in Nevada (Rowe Law Group) and has also engaged in lobbying efforts in other states, such as when CEO Elon Musk hired a dozen lobbyists in Texas this year to pass legislation advantageous to Tesla and another one of his companies, SpaceX.

Nevada officials across the political spectrum have embraced Tesla and the broader battery industry as a surefire way to expand the state’s tourism-dependent economy. State legislators approved a $1.25 billion tax incentive package for Tesla in 2014 — an unprecedented deal in the Silver State — and in 2023, state officials approved $330 million in additional tax breaks for a corporation valued at more than $1 trillion.

These investments are part of the state’s efforts to create a “lithium loop,” with the goal of encompassing all aspects of the process, from lithium extraction to its processing and eventual recycling.

“Our state has the components to be world leaders in battery development,” Lombardo said last year.

The newly crafted regulation will likely lead to a system where fewer types of hazardous materials in Nevada are designated as waste, meaning there will be fewer requirements for certain companies that deal with hazardous materials.

The regulation was part of a broader effort to create a new framework in Nevada governing “hazardous secondary materials,” which are manufacturing byproducts that are not subject to certain federal waste regulations if they are legitimately recycled and meet other federal criteria. The state must validate that a company is meeting this criteria. .

Corrado DeGasperis, CEO at Comstock Inc., a Northern Nevada-based company that was involved in the battery recycling industry but has since pivoted to solar panel recycling, said under the new framework, companies will be incentivized to recycle their products. Disposing them as waste triggers more government oversight.

“Nevada’s way, way, way better off with these materials being recycled,” DeGasperis said.

In an interview, NDEP Deputy Administrator Jeffrey Kinder said the agency did not intend for the state’s hazardous secondary materials rules to be more stringent than the federal ones. It was only after input from industry officials that the agency recognized its proposed regulation would have been overly restrictive.

“We do sometimes ask for more stringent regulations through our own state process if we think there's a gap in what the federal program does,” he said. “But … that didn't exist. [It] is a fairly robust federal program that's been operating for a number of years in a number of states.”

Six facilities, including Redwood and Tesla, have notified the state they have applied to handle these secondary materials, according to NDEP.

Discarded lithium batteries are typically designated as hazardous waste because of their ignitability and reactivity, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But because the industry is still in its infancy, the recycling chain for lithium ion batteries is still being developed, according to Nevada lithium experts.

Top NDEP officials said, during their tenure, they have never been tasked with drafting regulations for a sector as large and rapidly evolving as the lithium recycling industry.

What Tesla got changed

Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan. These permits require ongoing compliance reports, and the EPA is able to issue orders or file lawsuits to these permitted facilities to require cleanups of spills.

These requirements, according to Tesla’s letter last year to state environmental regulators, could lead some lithium recyclers to “be forced to choose between losing ground to competitors in other states” or “ceasing business altogether.” Battery facilities have long eyed Nevada for its business-friendly environment, particularly the lack of state income tax.

Additionally, under the initial regulation, some materials would have still been classified as hazardous waste — and subject to stricter oversight — because the state did not intend to adopt certain federal rules. However, Tesla said in its letter to regulators that the decision to not adopt these rules “effectively advantages select recyclers, while disadvantaging others.”

Under the revised regulations, NDEP will now be solely responsible for validating whether battery facilities are meeting the requirements for legitimate recycling.

The agency has seven employees overseeing all hazardous waste compliance and enforcement for the entire state — not just for the battery factories.

“Why are the concerns of the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar regarding this project being ignored?","Ramesh stated on X that highlighting an impending ecological and humanitarian disaster is not ‘negative politics,’ but rather a serious expression of concern.

NEW DELHI — Hitting back at Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav for criticising the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, party leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said drawing the nation’s attention to an imminent “ecological and humanitarian disaster” is not “negative politics” but an expression of grave concern.

Ramesh said, the minister is simply unable to answer basic questions that Congress has been repeatedly raising on the project, PTI reported.

“The Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav has accused the Indian National Congress of doing what he calls ‘negative politics’ on the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project.

Drawing the nation’s attention to an imminent ecological and humanitarian disaster is NOT ‘negative politics’. It is an expression of grave concern,” Ramesh said on X.

The minister is simply unable to answer basic questions that the INC has been repeatedly raising on the project, he said and asked whether the Great Nicobar Mega Infra Project, which requires the diversion of lakhs of trees, violate the National Forest Policy, 1988 which states that “tropical rain/moist forests, particularly in areas Andaman & Nicobar Islands should be totally safeguarded?”

“Compensatory afforestation is always a poor substitute for old-growth forests but the afforestation planned in this project is farcical.

How can afforestation in distant Haryana, with a completely different ecosystem, be considered a genuine offset for the loss of old-growth rainforest unique to Great Nicobar? Why has the Government of Haryana already freed up 25 per cent of this land for mining instead of reserving it for the afforestation?” Ramesh said.

Why was the National Commission on Scheduled Tribes not consulted before the Nicobar project was approved, he asked.

“Why are the concerns of the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar regarding this project being ignored? Why is the Shompen Policy of the Islands, which explicitly calls for the integrity of the community to be prioritised in all projects, being disregarded?” Ramesh said.

Why does the “Social Impact Assessment” conducted as part of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR) ignore the existence of the Shompen and the Nicobarese, the Congress leader further asked.

“The Forest Rights Act (2006) holds the Shompen as the sole legally empowered authority to protect, preserve, regulate, and manage the tribal reserve.

Why does the Project’s approval process fail to recognize the same?” Ramesh said.

He pointed out that the island harbours endangered species, including leatherback turtles, megapodes, saltwater crocodiles, and rich coral systems. Won’t this project drive these species closer to extinction, he asked.

“Why are critical documents relating to this project, including the reports of the ground-truthing exercise conducted to reclassify the location of the planned transshipment port from CRZ1-A, not being published in the open?” Ramesh said.

Given the island’s history of severe subsidence during the 2004 tsunami and its location in a high-seismic zone, can the sustainability of this project be assured, he further asked.

“Over twenty years ago, a valuable book was published.

It was called ‘Supreme Court on Forest Conservation’ and it was authored by Ritwick Dutta and Bhupender Yadav.

Sadly the first author has had investigative agencies unleashed against him for his environmental activism – but happily the second author has had a much better fate. When will that Bhupender Yadav awake?” he said.

Yadav last Thursday hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in “negative politics”.

Speaking at an event organised by The Public Affairs Forum of India here, Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region.

Yadav said only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar’s forest area will be used for the project.

His remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the Rs 72,000 crore project a “planned misadventure” that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world’s most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by “making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes”.

“The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project’s proposed land area.

The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami.

This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,” Gandhi had said.

She had also argued that the Shompen face an even greater threat as the project denotifies a significant part of their reserve and will bring a large influx of people and tourists to the island.

In response, Yadav recently authored a column in the same newspaper, defending the project as one of strategic, defence and national importance.

He had said the plan is designed to transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region, with an international container transhipment terminal, a greenfield international airport, a 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant and a township over 16 sq km.",https://clarionindia.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-20-at-2.16.10-AM-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-21 06:57:55.232397

Stating that it will host public hearings on the matter following an influx of requests to extend the deadline for comments. The EPA has been through a tough few years recently, with the Trump administration stating that the agency is essentially not needed and even going so far as to suggest closing the agency altogether. Regardless, the public hearings are set to take place on 12 September 2025.

The EPA recently published one direct rule and one proposed rule for the sector

On July 22, the Environmental Protection Agency published a direct final rule (90 FR 34358) and a proposed rule (90 FR 34409) entitled “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule.” And the backlash from those new rules, both direct and proposed, has seen several requests for an extension to make comments on the rules.

The original deadline to submit comments was August 21, 2025; however, since then, the EPA has been overwhelmed by several requests to extend that initial deadline, and it appears that they have heard the calls, as they have now stated that an online public hearing will take place to offer people and companies a chance at making their voices heard.

One must commend the EPA for doing its job and fulfilling its purpose. Despite the overwhelming negative relationship with the current administration. The hearing will allow oral statements that are limited to 5 minutes per person, as well as pose initial questions to the statements made by the parties in attendance. Although it will not make any formal statements at the hearing.

The EPA will receive written comments until September 15 on the matter

The EPA has stated that they will accept any and all written comments on the proposed rules right up until the hearing takes place. It provided a 30-day notice of the hearings to the relevant stakeholders, so there is ample time for the parties involved to consider their comments and how to submit them to the agency. Expectations are that the agency will take every comment seriously and submit formal responses once the hearings have concluded.

“The scope of the proposed rule is limited to establishing an additional option for owners or operators of active CCR facilities or inactive CCR facilities with a legacy CCR surface impoundment to comply with the facility evaluation report (FER) Part 1 requirements and to extending compliance deadlines for the remaining CCRMU provisions published in the Federal Register on May 8, 2024.” – Environmental Protection Agency

Whether or not there will be any changes to the direct and proposed rules is yet to be determined. As to how this might affect the downstream sector is anyone’s guess. But that would be speculative at best at the moment. With several major refineries closing their doors, the sector is facing an uncertain future. Once the hearings have been completed, we expect to see formal responses from the EPA as they need time to assess the concerns of all affected by the rule changes.

What might the outcome of the online public hearings be, and how will it affect the rules

The public hearings are designed to offer the relevant stakeholders the chance to voice their concerns as to how the rules might affect their bottom line. While some parts of the world are seeing several companies expanding their downstream projects, this might force the companies in the region to reevaluate their long-term plans. With the United States aiming to revitalize its energy sector, thanks to several executive orders by the President, the impact of the hearings will only be felt after the 15 September date.

TVA and Type One Energy to Build 350 MW Fusion Plant

TVA has issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Type One Energy regarding the utility’s interest in the potential deployment of Type One Energy’s fusion power plant technology at its former Bull Run Fossil site once it is commercially ready. The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Type One Energy have expanded their cooperative agreement to develop a 350 MWe fusion pilot power plant called “Infinity Two” at TVA’s former Bull Run Fossil Plant near Oak Ridge, TN, targeting deployment by the mid-2030s. The partnership represents the first commercial contracts signed for a utility-scale fusion power project in the US

It will utilize Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology to provide baseload generation capacity. This collaboration positions TVA as the leading U.S. utility in advanced nuclear innovation, addressing growing energy demands from AI and data centers while advancing fusion commercialization timelines.

Infinity Two is a first-generation 350 MWe baseload power plant utilizing Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology. According to the press statement by Type One, the stellarator has demonstrated stable, steady-state operation with high efficiency, characteristics which are important for TVA and others in the industry who need to reliably generate on-demand power at competitive prices.

Type One Energy is developing Infinity Two using existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support near-term deployment of the technology.

Final decisions and definitive agreements regarding the funding and construction of Infinity Two, as well as any agreements to purchase the energy output, are subject to TVA Board approval, regulatory review, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes.

Type One leaders told local news media at the announcement event they hope to start constructing Infinity One, the prototype stellarator, in 2026. The prototype is designed to verify aspects of the design and serve as a training platform.

Type One’s lead scientist told Knox News in March that company won’t need a scientific revelation to move the stellarator design forward. As CEO Chris Mowry put it, “This is not a science project.”

“This is an actual commercial fusion power plant that we are embarking on here.”

The Knoxville News reports that TVA’s role as a partner will include development of machining and fabricating some of the components of the stellarator.

TVA CEO Don Moul said the collaboration between the utility and Type One will be educational.

“We have a lot of learning to do. I think that’s the value of being able to have the stellarator here, having our power services shop provide some of the fabrication capabilities and, quite frankly, having some of our staff here help with the operational input with some of the designers so that we make this practical, but also as forward moving as possible.”

Executives from Type One and TVA made the announcement alongside state and local officials at the former Bull Run Fossil Plant site in Clinton, which TVA retired in 2023.

Proxima Fusion Extends Series A to €200M Total Funding

Proxima Fusion announced an extension to its Series A round with new funding from CDP Venture Capital (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Group), Italy’s largest venture capital operator, the European Innovation Council Fund (EICF), and Brevan Howard Macro Venture Fund, associated with one of the world’s leading asset managers known for investing in global economic shifts.

The €15 million Series A extension brings the company’s total funding to €200 million ($230M). The EICF equity investment is the latest European public fund to back Proxima, following earlier investments from the DeepTech & Climate Fonds (DTCF) and High–Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF) – both backed by the German Ministry of Economics and Energy – as well as Bayern Kapital, owned by LfA Förderbank Bayern, and the non-profit Max Planck Foundation, which exclusively supports research across the institutes of the Max Planck Society. The new investment from the EICF follows a €2.5 million grant previously awarded to Proxima.

“CDP Venture Capital believes firmly that Europe’s deep tech ecosystem has a key role to play in developing future energy solutions” said Alessandro Scortecci, Chief Investment Officer, Direct Investments at CDP Venture Capital.

Just three months after announcing Europe’s largest-ever fusion round, Proxima has already grown by another 20% to 100 employees and is rapidly converting its new capital into industrial action to anchor its long-term roadmap. With the new capital in the bag, Proxima placed large-scale purchase orders for:

High-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape to secure long-term supply for the mission-critical HTS magnet program;

The manufacturing of structural support plates for its first HTS non-planar magnet, the Stellarator Model Coil (SMC);

Its own in-house cable manufacturing line to accelerate R&D capabilities and produce its first long length SMC cables;

Full size and weight dummy coils and prototype vacuum vessel sections to demonstrate hardware design, manufacturing capability and development of assembly processes for stellarators.

This latest funding will accelerate the company’s engineering progress toward the SMC, which will de-risk major elements of HTS magnet technology for stellarators. Proxima’s ambitious target: bring SMC to life in 2027. In addition, the team is simultaneously completing the design of its net energy gain demo stellarator, Alpha, while evaluating potential building sites across Europe.

About Proxima Fusion

About Kyoto Fusioneering

Kyoto Fusioneering launched the FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) project in November 2024, taking on the role of project leader. FAST represents a private-sector-driven, industry–academia collaboration with the ambitious aim of proving fusion electricity generation within the 2030s in Japan. The initiative brings together leading researchers and companies, both in Japan and worldwide, to tackle the critical engineering challenges of fusion and to accelerate the transition from experimental reactors to practical, commercial-scale energy systems.

FAST’s mission is to prove that a complete fusion power generation system is possible by integrating plasma generation and control through D-T*3 fusion reactions, energy conversion, and fuel systems.

UNITY-1: At the core of this effort is the “UNITY-1” project, which aims to demonstrate how a fusion heat cycle system harnesses and utilizes energy produced by fusion reactions. UNITY-1 has now reached the final stage of validating its power generation technology through a liquid metal loop. The project is on track to achieve a world first: successfully demonstrating power generation technology using a simulated fusion plant*2.

UNITY-2: In addition, the fusion fuel cycle system, which continuously supplies fuel, is undergoing performance testing of individual devices and systems at the company’s new R&D facility, established adjacent to its headquarters in January this year. In 2026, Fusion Fuel Cycles Inc., a joint venture between Kyoto Fusioneering and Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, will begin an integrated demonstration of a fuel cycle system in Canada, under the project “UNITY-2.”

Gyrotron Systems: Kyoto Fusioneering’s plasma heating system—the gyrotron system—has recently been adopted by Tokamak Energy Ltd. in the UK*4, further expanding its footprint in global fusion initiatives.

Oxford Spin-out First Light Fusion Seeks Backing for Inertial Fusion Demonstrator

First Light Fusion believes it can drive down the costs of nuclear fusion but it needs £150m for a demonstration facility.

First Light Fusion (FLF) has outlined plans for an inertial fusion energy test facility, a £150 million project pitched as a faster, cheaper route to commercial fusion power. The University of Oxford spin-out outlined the company’s concept for high-gain fusion, known as fusion via low-power assembly and rapid excitation, or FLARE.

Gain refers to a process where more energy is converted from the fusion reaction than energy delivered to the fuel, and has long been a barrier to commercial fusion. FLF said its modelling shows the FLARE concept could produce an energy gain of up to 1,000, far higher than the current experimental levels achieved.

Founded in 2011, FLF has attracted more than £78 million in backing from a consortium including IP Group, Oxford Science Enterprises, Salica and Host Plus.

And as the UK prepares to invest £2.5bn into a different kind of fusion reactor, FLF urged the government “not to put all its eggs in one basket”.

Professor Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said the FLARE concept combines well-established and extensively studied concepts.

“What makes First Light’s approach different is the way in which these concepts have been combined. In addition, the adaptation of First Light’s proven amplifier technology to cylindrical implosions means that the required fusion conditions can be realised using low voltage pulsed power, significantly reducing the cost of both the driver and the fusion targets.”

FLF said its approach differs from the conventional approach to inertial fusion energy (IFE), which is to compress and heat fuel at the same time to achieve ignition. By contrast, FLF’s approach splits this process into two parts. First, it compresses the fuel in a controlled manner and then uses a separate process to ignite it. This generates a “massive surplus of energy”, FLF said, in a process known as a ‘fast fusion’.

The company said this method has “long been researched”, but that it is “now made practical for the first time” using its technology. FLF claims its approach would underpin the design for future commercial reactors, allowing partners to build the systems using FLF technology as the fuel.

FLF said an experimental gain facility using its technology would cost between $100-$200 million, or just 5% of the $5.3 billion (£3.9bn) NIF in California.

The company said it expects to achieve gains above today’s records by the early 2030s, with the demonstrator facility not required for “several years”.

While the company is not seeking funding from the UK government at this stage, FLF said “any government support would be welcomed”.

With the UK government committing £2.5bn towards the STEP fusion project, which uses a process known as magnetic confinement fusion, FLF said the country should “not put all its eggs in one basket” when it comes to fusion energy.

General Atomics to Build a National Data Ecosystem Aimed at Accelerating Commercial Fusion Power

The multi-institutional project secures four-year DOE funding to unify fusion data and workflows into an accessible nationwide resource

Scientists at General Atomics (GA) announced this month that they will be leading a multi-institutional initiative to create a unified data system for fusion energy research in the United States—called the Fusion Energy Data Ecosystem and Repository (FEDER).

The project will be funded through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) Collaborative, a multimillion-dollar initiative designed to fast-track fusion development, support American innovation and bolster U.S. leadership in the energy sector.

Researchers plan to use FEDER to create a shared, standardized platform that links experimental results, simulation outputs and workflows from national laboratories, universities and private companies, turning today’s disconnected datasets and workflows into a unified community resource that speeds up discovery and brings commercial fusion power closer to reality.

“Fusion research advances fastest when data flows freely and securely rather than remain trapped in isolated silos, proprietary formats, and disconnected analysis tools,” said Dr. Raffi Nazikian, director of Fusion Data Science at General Atomics.

“FEDER will break down barriers between institutions and disciplines, integrating datasets, computational models and research workflows. We will be able to capture new data in FEDER’s living commons and make them available for immediate reuse in the next experiment or simulation.”

GA is joined in the FEDER initiative by a coalition of leading institutions: the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Idaho National Laboratory; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Plasma Science and Fusion Center; Hewlett Packard Enterprise; UCLA; and West Virginia University.

ogether, their experts in plasma physics, fusion engineering, materials science and high-performance computing will collaborate with other FIRE Collaboratives and research teams nationwide to build the community-driven platform.

Fact-checkers at Carbon Brief debunked some of the most common myths about solar that can negatively influence public perception and hinder the adoption of renewable energy.

One of the most prominent claims about solar is that it doesn't produce reliable energy since it only generates power when the sun shines, and therefore, reduces grid stability and safety.

While that might be a valid concern if solar were the only form of energy produced, that isn't the case, as solar complements other clean sources of electricity such as wind, nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower.

Moreover, with more battery storage systems being installed both commercially and residentially, they provide backup power during outages and reduce energy costs by storing cheap power for later use at night or during peak hours.

The International Energy Agency estimated that global electricity generated by solar will quadruple by 2030 and surpass coal, gas, nuclear, wind, and hydro to become the world's leading source of energy by 2033, revealing that solar is indeed capable of powering societies on a large scale.

Another popular critique of solar and wind energy is that they're expensive, but according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, more than 90% of renewable energy projects are now cheaper than comparable dirty fuel alternatives.

According to EnergySage, solar is still a great investment for homeowners, even though tax credits are expiring at the end of the year. Prices per watt are at all-time lows, and since systems last at least 30 years, that translates to decades of reduced electric bills and more energy independence.

Using EnergySage's free tools, you can access solar installation estimates and compare quotes, making it a convenient way to go solar while finding a system to suit your budget.

The company's free services, which include a mapping tool that allows users to view the average cost of a system and available tax incentives in their state, can help you secure the best price for rooftop solar panels and even save an average of $10,000 on installations.

By pairing solar energy with other energy-efficient appliances, such as heat pumps, you can further reduce your energy bills. EnergySage also offers a free heat pump quotes comparison tool, allowing you to find the right installer and model for your needs and making it easy to take care of multiple home improvement projects in one place.

Make sure to act fast to take advantage of the 30% federal tax credit for home solar and heat pump installations; they will expire by the end of 2025.

As Carbon Brief explained, misinformation about solar power can be incredibly harmful, and some of ""these narratives are having real-world consequences."" Some online anti-wind and solar groups even encourage local opposition to clean energy projects in rural communities across the U.S.

Armed with the right information, it's much easier for citizens to make informed decisions about home solar and for policymakers to pass laws that will continue promoting safe, affordable energy for all.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/solar-powerimage-recCs8TXbww9RNaNI.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 04:00:23.059907

Ramesh questioned the minister’s inability to answer basic queries repeatedly raised by the Congress, highlighting potential violations of the National Forest Policy, 1988, which calls for the protection of tropical rainforests, especially in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He also criticised the project’s compensatory afforestation plan, noting that planting trees in Haryana cannot offset the destruction of Great Nicobar’s unique old-growth forests.

The Congress leader further asked why the National Commission on Scheduled Tribes and the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar were not consulted, why the Shompen Policy — which safeguards the tribal community — was being ignored, and why the Social Impact Assessment failed to account for the Shompen and Nicobarese populations.

""The Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav has accused the Indian National Congress of doing what he calls 'negative politics' on the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project. Drawing the nation's attention to an imminent ecological and humanitarian disaster is NOT 'negative politics'. It is an expression of grave concern,"" Ramesh said on X.

Ramesh raised concerns over the project’s impact on endangered species such as leatherback turtles, megapodes, saltwater crocodiles, and the island’s coral ecosystems. He also questioned the sustainability of the project in a high-seismic zone with a history of severe tsunami subsidence. He called for transparency, asking why critical documents, including the ground-truthing exercise reports for the proposed transshipment port, were not publicly available.

Yadav had accused Congress of indulging in “negative politics”, asserting that only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar’s forest area would be used for the Rs 72,000 crore project, which he described as essential for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region. He defended the plan as a transformative initiative, featuring an international container transshipment terminal, greenfield airport, 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant, and a township spanning 16 sq km.

Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi had earlier described the project as a “planned misadventure”, warning it threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys a unique ecosystem, and risks natural disasters. She highlighted that ancestral villages of the Nicobarese, evacuated after the 2004 tsunami, would face permanent displacement, while the Shompen reserve would be denotified and subjected to large-scale human influx.

Ramesh concluded by urging the government to heed environmental and tribal safeguards, emphasising that ecological integrity and community rights cannot be sidelined in the pursuit of infrastructure and strategic goals.

Editorial | ​Nicobar triangle: on the ₹72,000-crore project on Great Nicobar Island

Mr. Yadav last Thursday (September 18, 2025) hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in ""negative politics.""

Speaking at an event organised by The Public Affairs Forum of India in New Delhi, Mr. Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region. Mr. Yadav said only 1.78% of Great Nicobar's forest area will be used for the project.

His remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the ₹72,000 crore project a ""planned misadventure"" that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world's most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Confusion over clearances for Great Nicobar project persists

Ms. Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by ""making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes.""

""The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project's proposed land area. The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami. This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,"" Ms. Gandhi had said.

She had also argued that the Shompen face an even greater threat as the project denotifies a significant part of their reserve and will bring a large influx of people and tourists to the island. In response, Mr. Yadav recently authored a column in the same newspaper, defending the project as one of strategic, defence and national importance.

He had said the plan is designed to transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region, with an international container transhipment terminal, a greenfield international airport, a 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant and a township over 16 sq km.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/id8taw/article70051985.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/27_JAIRAM_RAMESH_01_05_DELHI.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 04:58:15.014236

The decision to shut down coal mines has emerged as a critical issue shaping the future of energy, economy, and environment globally. As we approach 2025, coal mine closures mark a pivotal reflection of shifting energy paradigms. However, these closures bring not only environmental benefits but also complex economic and social challenges—issues that are particularly significant in regions heavily dependent on mining for their livelihoods and local development.

This comprehensive article explores the multifaceted impacts of coal mine closures in 2025, focusing on economic and social transitions, environmental restoration and reclamation, government and policy strategies, and the vital role of technology-enabled transition—offering actionable, future-oriented insights for communities, regions, and stakeholders.

“Over 200 coal mines worldwide are scheduled for closure by 2025, affecting millions in surrounding communities.”

Why Coal Mine Closure in 2025? Shifting Paradigms Explained

As global urgency to address climate change intensifies, coal—the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel—faces declining demand and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In 2025, the movement to close coal mines is propelled by several key factors:

Stringent regulations on emissions and air quality driving policy-led transitions.

Rapid advancement and cost-competitiveness of renewable energy systems.

An urgent need for environmental restoration of degraded lands and ecosystems.

Financial firms and national governments divesting from carbon-heavy industries.

Changing expectations of investors and communities towards sustainable development.

Together, these shifting paradigms create both immense challenges and transformative opportunities. Understanding the full scope requires examining the economic, environmental, and social implications of coal mine closure.

Economic Impact of Coal Mine Closure on Communities

Coal mines have historically served as economic pillars in many regions, providing direct employment to tens of thousands of workers—while supporting ancillary industries such as transport, equipment manufacturing, and local businesses. The loss of this economic engine through mine closures can be devastating:

Increased unemployment: Tens of thousands face job loss, with ripple effects across local economies.

Business decline: Ancillary businesses (repair shops, equipment suppliers, restaurants) suffer reduced demand.

Regional GDP impacts: Drops in income, spending, and investment.

Uncertainty and poverty: Communities may witness population decline and deeper poverty levels.

In 2025, these challenges grow more acute, especially in regions and communities heavily dependent on coal mining. Governments and industry stakeholders are thus increasingly focusing on “just transition” frameworks. Such frameworks are aimed at cushioning the social impact of coal mine closure through re-skilling programs, economic diversification, and comprehensive social welfare measures.

Community Livelihoods: From Mining Pillars to Diversification

The future of community livelihoods in a post-coal world depends on the success of diversified transitions. Coal mine closure disrupts not only workers but entire local economies. In response, progressive policy and community strategies are:

Investing in alternative industries: Green energy manufacturing, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly tourism offer viable opportunities for new employment.

Supporting re-skilling programs: Training for workers to adapt to new, in-demand sectors.

Developing local entrepreneurship: Initiatives to support small businesses and innovation.

Leveraging satellite solutions for transition monitoring.

For instance, advanced fleet management can help local logistics businesses optimize remaining resources and adapt to changing infrastructure usage after mine closure.

However, the success of such transitions varies widely. Areas lacking infrastructure or investment can struggle to sustain economic recovery and may experience population decline and poverty. Therefore, coordinated interventions at local, national, and international levels remain crucial, ensuring that the costs of transition do not deepen disparities.

The Challenge of Just Transition Frameworks After Coal Mine Closure

“Just transition” refers to policies that prioritize social welfare, equity, and economic opportunity as societies move from coal-based industries toward sustainable alternatives. In 2025, examples of just transition challenges include:

Uneven readiness: Some communities lack access to resources or support, exacerbating disparities.

Intergenerational impacts: Family and cultural ties to coal mining increase the psychological impacts of closure.

Financing gaps: Without adequate investment in education, infrastructure, and new industries, transitions stall.

Long-term planning: Ensuring that short-term welfare programs evolve into sustainable, future-proof solutions.

The ability to create new employment and develop alternative industries hinges not simply on funding, but on proactive policy coordination, community engagement, and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of interventions.

Environmental Restoration & Land Reclamation Following Coal Mine Closure

Coal mining is long associated with widespread environmental degradation: deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, and habitat destruction. The closure of mines presents a unique opportunity for environmental restoration and land reclamation. In 2025, this opportunity is more urgent—and technologically advanced—than ever.

Key Environmental Implications & Opportunities

Restoring degraded land: Stabilizing and enriching soil using native plant cover and bioengineering.

Improving water quality: Treating mine tailings and contaminated runoff to protect local waterways.

Mitigating carbon emissions: Through carbon sequestration in reclaimed land and new forestry projects.

Rebuilding biodiversity: Reforestation and habitat recreation support wildlife and ecosystem recovery.

Many decommissioned mine sites are now transformed into renewable energy projects, including large-scale solar farms and wind energy installations—turning the liability of former mines into productive assets that directly contribute to regional energy needs.

“Coal mine closures in 2025 could reduce regional CO2 emissions by up to 350 million tons annually.”

Best Practices in Mine Land Reclamation for 2025

Active community involvement: Local input ensures culturally relevant land use and long-term stewardship.

Real-time monitoring: Using satellite-based technologies—like those provided by Farmonaut’s remote sensing platform—to track land healing progress, soil health, and water quality.

Adaptive management: Reclamation plans are iteratively improved based on on-the-ground and satellite data, maximizing ecosystem restoration.

Transparency: Traceability and reporting (powered by modern blockchain technology—see Farmonaut Product Traceability) assure stakeholders of environmental compliance and progress

With these practices, environmental restoration after coal mine closure becomes a vehicle for climate action, sustainable land use, and regional economic regeneration.

Renewable Energy & Repurposing Decommissioned Sites After Coal Mine Closure

With coal mine closure, there is an unprecedented chance to repurpose land and existing infrastructure toward sustainable energy systems and new industries:

Solar and wind energy “upcycling”: Many decommissioned open-cast mines are well suited for large-scale solar or wind power installations.

Eco-industrial development:

Repurposing transport corridors, equipment facilities, and mine housing for green manufacturing, advanced material recycling, or logistics hubs.

Urban renewal and tourism: Converted mines in some regions foster recreational parks, biodiversity conservation areas, and eco-tourism, revitalizing regional socio-economic life.

Continuous environmental monitoring: Tools like Farmonaut’s carbon footprinting solutions allow authorities and companies to measure and optimize project sustainability over time—key for compliance and climate impact verification.

Repurposed infrastructure thus not only restores landscapes after closure, but also helps ensure regions remain future-ready and economically viable.

Policy, Security & Strategy in Coal Mine Closures

The movement toward coal mine closure is inherently political and strategic. Governments and policy-makers face the formidable task of balancing energy security, national interests, social welfare, and climate imperatives. Some of the central issues and challenges include:

Strategic decommissioning: Ensuring mines located near critical infrastructure or defense sites are safely closed without jeopardizing national security.

Coordinated infrastructure transition: Repurposing or safely dismantling transport, equipment handling, and processing infrastructure to minimize risk and maximize future utility.

Dynamic policy frameworks: Adapting to rapid technological, market, and environmental shifts with flexible policies that support effective transitions.

International cooperation: Harmonizing closure approaches across countries and supporting transnational climate targets.

Ongoing monitoring & compliance: Leveraging satellite-based oversight and real-time environmental tracking for transparent reporting and enforcement.

Stakeholders increasingly recognize that the path toward successful coal mine closure rests on integration, transparency, and readiness for new energy, industry and environmental realities.

Momentum builds momentum.
Good opportunities attract talent, which helps businesses expand and create yet more opportunities.","A large, growing, and well-qualified workforce is essential to ongoing economic expansion. Texas has an advantage over many areas in that our population is younger and, hence, has more people in childbearing age ranges. Additionally, the state has long been attracting workers from other parts of the country (and, indeed, the world). A recent report by Lightcast, a global labor market intelligence firm, illustrates just how well Texas is doing.

Lightcast’s Talent Attraction Scorecard ranks states on seven components. The analysis looks at overall job growth over the past five years at an occupational level, then becomes more specific by delving into the numbers in high-earnings categories and blue-collar categories. Growth in the college-educated population and prime-age (25-54) population is considered, as well as people arriving with incomes above $25,000 per year. How an area is performing as a result of competitive advantages rather than overall national trends is also part of the ranking.

Texas had three of the top 10 large (250,000+ residents) metropolitan areas. Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington topped the list by a very large margin. Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos was second, and Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands was sixth. All other metro areas on the list were in Florida (which led Texas slightly on an overall statewide basis). At the other end of the spectrum were the greater Los Angeles (ranked last at 196), New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Boston areas.

A variety of factors influence in-migration. One is a dynamic economy. Texas has been a growth leader for a number of years, generating jobs across a broad spectrum of industries. These opportunities attract skilled workers, and the state’s sustained economic momentum is clearly a factor. Another advantage is the cost of living. It’s no coincidence, for example, that the states where people are attracted have no state income tax. In some of the areas losing talent in greatest numbers, there are not only state income taxes, but also substantial local taxes and particularly hefty levies on high-income individuals. When combined with higher costs for housing and other necessities, the financially rational decision can quickly shift toward Texas, Florida, and other less expensive places to live.

Momentum builds momentum. Good opportunities attract talent, which helps businesses expand and create yet more opportunities. Texas has been dominating major locations and expansions for well over a decade. The state is also attracting workers needed for continued growth. There are daunting challenges going forward, including providing adequate educational opportunities, electric power, water, and other infrastructure to facilitate further expansion, and overcoming perceptions discouraging some knowledge workers from coming to or remaining in the state. For now, however, Texas is well positioned to remain one of the most dynamic economies in the nation.

Louise CullenAgriculture and environment correspondent, BBC News NI

People living near renewable energy projects may get a discount on their electricity bills in future, under a proposal in a new Stormont scheme.

Known as the Renewable Energy Price Guarantee (REPG) scheme, it could also lead to lower electricity bills for all.

The REPG is designed to encourage investment in wind, solar and energy storage projects to help meet the goal of generating 80% of our energy from renewable sources by 2030.

Renewable sector leaders welcomed the announcement but added that ""ambition must now be matched by delivery"".

'Deliver lower costs'

Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald said the scheme would ""boost renewable generation and deliver lower electricity costs to households than they are paying today"".

She added that it would ensure local communities benefit from the transition to net zero.

The final scheme design, published by the Department for the Economy, acknowledges that the success of the 2030 target ""will depend on the availability of a sufficient pipeline of renewable projects and the development of electricity infrastructure to support additional generation"".

Capacity limits in the electricity grid have led to wind power having to be switched off – known as ""dispatching down"" – to protect infrastructure.

Scheme will 'power economic growth'

The chair of RenewableNI said the announcement would create jobs and attract investment, creating ""stability"" for consumers.

""It is one of, if not the, most directly beneficial actions the executive has taken to power economic growth here, particularly in rural areas,"" said Tamasin Fraser.

""We've seen over the last numbers of years the impact that the war in Russia/Ukraine has had on bills by relying on imported fossil fuels.

""We can harness our own clean, green, indigenous resources and that will help hedge against that volatility.""

She added that reaching the 80% renewable generation target would deliver ""approximately £110 million net benefit annually to the consumer"".

Under the Programme for Government (2024-27), the Northern Ireland Executive has committed to supporting industry to increase renewable generation by another 40%.

The first auction to award generation contracts under the scheme will be held in early 2027.

It will aim to secure from 750 gigawatt hours per year to 1,250Gwh/year of power.

The price for that power will be agreed at the auction.

To fund the scheme, a fixed levy will be added to electricity bills under a new two-way payments' system.

When prices drop below the agreed contract level, renewable energy generators will receive a payment from the electricity companies.

Conversely, when prices rise, excess payments will be collected from the generators, returned to the electricity companies and then passed on to consumers.

Over time, as renewable generation increases and fossil fuel dependence declines, this will result in lower and more stable electricity prices.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3ace/live/75c536d0-9595-11f0-b72b-7959ebab31f0.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 02:58:04.700756

Stellantis is successfully testing a revolutionary approach to electric vehicle battery design that could reshape its EV architecture. The Intelligent Battery Integrated System (IBIS) integrates the inverter and charger functions directly into battery modules, eliminating the need for separate charging hardware that typically adds weight and complexity to electric vehicles.

The IBIS system uses software control to manage these integrated functions, reducing vehicle weight by 88 lbs on average, freeing up space and reducing charging time by 15%. The innovative battery technology is also 10% more efficient than conventional EV systems with the same-sized battery pack, potentially extending range without increasing battery capacity. Each battery module operates independently through sophisticated software, creating a more flexible and responsive power management system.

Game-Changing Benefits for Stellantis Brands

The integrated battery system represents a significant advancement in EV technology that could benefit multiple Stellantis brands across North America. Jeep's current 4xe lineup, including the Grand Cherokee 4xe with its 26-mile electric range and Wrangler 4xe offering 21 miles of electric-only driving, could see meaningful improvements with IBIS technology implementation.

A 10% efficiency boost would translate to approximately 2.6 additional miles of electric range for the Grand Cherokee 4xe and over 2 miles for the Wrangler 4xe. While these gains might seem modest, they represent meaningful improvements where every mile of electric range reduces reliance on gasoline. The weight reduction of 88 pounds also improves overall efficiency. Dodge's Charger EVs could also benefit from up to 30 miles of additional range and space savings, while Ram's recently shelved electric pickup truck could have leveraged the faster charging capabilities and reduced complexity.

Too Little, Too Late?

Traditional EVs use separate onboard chargers that convert grid AC power to DC for battery storage, while onboard inverters convert battery DC power to AC for electric motors. By consolidating these functions into the battery pack itself, Stellantis creates opportunities for simplified vehicle assembly, reduced manufacturing costs, and improved reliability. The technology also improves Stellantis' position against Tesla and Ford in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The IBIS technology could prove valuable as Stellantis accelerates its electrification timeline across brands like Dodge, which plans to transition its performance lineup to electric power. The system's ability to provide faster charging and higher efficiency while maintaining smaller packaging requirements addresses two critical consumer concerns about EV adoption. Stellantis says the technology should see production before 2030, but really, it can’t come soon enough.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/ca6b1986e2fcd5473ee29a8863c258a9,N,,2025-09-21 12:04:30.455845

The organization is stifling the development of clean energy, setting the rules for the capacity market, forcing energy prices up and continuing to marginalize the voice of the very states it serves.

Find out the exact measure of injustice and wrong that will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted.” Paul G. Pinsky is the director of the Maryland Energy Administration, to which he was appointed by Gov.","“Turn the lights off” is a common refrain in homes across America. But keeping the lights on is what PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization, attempts to do. PJM (standing for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) is the Mid-Atlantic states’ regional transmission organization. It acts like a traffic cop to facilitate the transfer of electricity across state borders.

Why should this organization and its actions matter? Because the prices of energy are rapidly rising for most of the 65 million people it serves. And, unfortunately, PJM’s role is growing — in the wrong direction. The organization is stifling the development of clean energy, setting the rules for the capacity market, forcing energy prices up and continuing to marginalize the voice of the very states it serves.

PJM serves 13 adjoining states and Washington, D.C., covering over 65 million people. It directs electrons from power plants to end users, like us, who use the electricity necessary for everyday life. Currently, the key stakeholders in the organization are the entrenched power industry insiders, including generators, transmission developers and utilities — and herein lies the rub. Even though PJM was created to organize energy transfers among states, these very same states feel they have little voice in the structure and policy-setting of the operation.

Case in point: PJM has closed the queue to bring new, additional energy onto the grid for the last two and a half years. During this period of limited supply, not surprisingly, energy costs have risen. Not so ironically, much of the energy awaiting approval is solar and battery storage. While fossil fuels make up most of the current PJM mix, the organization declares itself “energy-source neutral.” Its policy? Block new, clean energy and keep the current fossil fuels, major contributors to climate change, running at full blast.

Recently, the governors of nine states, including my own Maryland Governor Wes Moore, wrote to PJM with a complaint: The states being served have little or no voice in it. This leaves the interests of ratepayers — the residents they serve — out in the proverbial cold.

When two board seats recently opened, the states’ governors formally asked for representatives who might be sympathetic to states’ ratepayers, the vast number of whom are working families.

The governors recommended two candidates. One was the outgoing chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), who previously served as chair of Virginia’s Public Service Commission. The second was another former FERC commissioner. Both had been originally nominated for their positions by a U.S. president and subsequently received approval by the U.S. Senate.

The PJM nominating committee rejected both of these outstanding candidates, ignoring the governors’ plea for a voice and, for all intents and purposes, told the governors to go pound sand.

Unfortunately, virtually all of the members of the PJM Members Committee are energy insiders who get to decide who leads them and what their policy should be. So, of the eight members of the committee directed to fill the vacancies, none represented ratepayers. What a surprise!

Sadly, neither of the proposed candidates suggested by the governors to give a voice to consumers appears to have been seriously considered.

As a follow-up, on Aug. 21, 2025, PJM explained that if the governors wanted to pursue any changes to the nominating process, it would require a change in PJM’s Operating Agreement.

And how would states do that? You guessed it: It requires the support of the very same Members Committee that shaped the nominations committee. It appears the process was built to make states chase their tails. Until states have a real voice at PJM, the threat of ever-rising energy prices and distribution costs will continue ravaging families across the 13 states and D.C.

Mark Christie, the outgoing chair of FERC, said it best at a recent national conference. He ended his speech with this exhortation: “The two most important questions in utility regulation are: ‘Who pays?’ and ‘Who profits?’”

Until states have a significant voice at the PJM table, ratepayers will be at the mercy of the companies generating, supplying and distributing this important resource.

While Frederick Douglass was not referring to energy when he discussed power, his posit stands just as appropriate today: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it never will. Find out the exact measure of injustice and wrong that will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted.”

""We're facing lower snowpack in the Mountain West, where, every year, we're seeing a few less days of skiing,"" said Pitkin County Commissioner Jeffrey Woodruff.

""It's our community that has dealt with issues of cancer because they've been forced to drink the water and lead pipes and so many other pollutants,"" said Commerce City Council Member Renee Chacon.

""I am the wife of a firefighter, and since I've been here and with my husband, the number of fires has increased exponentially. And it's not just, 'Oh, it's on a mountain. Oh, it's out and some bushland.' It's in our neighborhoods. It's in our communities. We see the smoke every day. I have a four-year-old who can't go outside and play on certain days because of the wildfire smoke,"" said Danielle Abrams with the Sierra Club.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires reporting of greenhouse gas data from large greenhouse gas emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites. The EPA says the GHGRP costs companies money they could use to improve environmental controls at their facilities.

In a press release issued by the EPA back on September 12, they said, ""Unlike mandatory information collections under the Clean Air Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is not directly related to a potential regulation. It has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.""

The EPA under the Trump administration also says that if it gets rid of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, it could save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs.

Environmentalists who oppose the measures say that corporate profits should not be made on the backs of America's citizens.

Chacon says if regulations like the GHGRP are repealed, it's people like those in her community who will pay the price because they will see the negative health effects first, like they are now.

""They're paying even higher health costs when it comes to inhalers or even missing school,"" said Chacon.

Abrams is urging all of Colorado to reach out to the EPA through public comment and tell them what they think.

By marrying nuclear reliability with strategic investments, policy advocacy, and partnerships with energy-hungry industries, the company is redefining what clean infrastructure can achieve.","The energy transition is no longer a distant aspiration but an urgent imperative, driven by climate policy, technological innovation, and shifting demand from energy-intensive industries. At the heart of this transformation lies a critical question: How can renewable infrastructure balance decarbonization goals with the reliability required to power a modern economy?

Energy's performance in 2025 offers a compelling case study. The company's nuclear fleet achieved a staggering 98.8% capacity factor during the summer of 2025—despite extreme heatwaves and record humidity—demonstrating that nuclear energy remains a cornerstone of grid stability in an era of climate volatilityConstellation's Clean Energy Centers Deliver Near-Perfect Summer Reliability[ 1 ]. This reliability, paired with strategic investments and policy tailwinds, positions Constellation as a bellwether for the future of renewable infrastructure.

Nuclear as the Backbone of Decarbonization

Constellation's summer 2025 results underscore nuclear power's unique value proposition. While solar and wind energy face inherent intermittency, nuclear plants operate at near-constant output, providing baseload power that complements variable renewables. Constellation's 21 reactors generated enough electricity to power 16 million homes during the summer, a feat achieved through $7 billion in decade-long investments to modernize equipment and extend reactor lifespansConstellation's Clean Energy Centers Deliver Near-Perfect Summer Reliability[ 1 ]. This operational excellence is not accidental. The company's focus on plant uprates—such as the 160 MW increase planned for Byron and Braidwood by 2029—and the restart of retired facilities like the Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania (adding 835 MW) highlight a disciplined approach to scaling capacity without the long lead times of greenfield projectsConstellation Energy Corporation (CEG) Growth and Financial …[ 2 ].

The financial rationale for these investments is robust. Constellation allocated $3 billion to nuclear infrastructure in 2025, with $3.5 billion planned for 2026, including 35% for nuclear fuel procurement to secure supply chainsConstellation Energy Corporation (CEG) Growth and Financial …[ 2 ]. These expenditures are already yielding returns: Q2 2025 earnings hit $2.67 per share (GAAP) and $1.91 per share (adjusted), driven by favorable wholesale markets and long-term PPAsEarnings call transcript: Constellation Energy’s Q2 2025 …[ 3 ]. The company's 10% dividend increase and $400 million accelerated share repurchase program further signal confidence in its capital structure.

Strategic Partnerships and the AI-Driven Energy Demand

These deals are not merely commercial wins—they reflect the urgent need for low-carbon, reliable power to fuel data centers and AI development, sectors projected to dominate global energy demand growth.

The strategic alignment between Constellation and high-energy industries is further reinforced by policy. The Inflation Reduction Act's nuclear production tax credit and the ADVANCE Act's regulatory reforms are accelerating the deployment of advanced reactors, including small modular reactors (SMRs), which Constellation is poised to integrate with its existing fleet2025 U.S. Nuclear Energy Revival: Policy, Innovation & Investment[ 5 ]. As

notes, global nuclear investments could reach $2.2 trillion by 2050, with capacity doubling to 860 gigawatts—a trajectory Constellation is well-positioned to influenceInvesting in Nuclear Energy Renaissance: $2.2 trillion[ 6 ].

A High-Conviction Play in a Shifting Energy Landscape

For long-term capital allocators, Constellation represents a rare combination of proven operational excellence, strategic foresight, and policy alignment. Its recent acquisition of Calpine—a $2.6 billion deal expected to close by year-end—adds nearly 60 GW of low-emission capacity, including geothermal and gas-fired assets, to diversify its portfolio while maintaining a clean energy focusEarnings call transcript: Constellation Energy’s Q2 2025 …[ 3 ]. This acquisition, coupled with its nuclear-centric strategy, strengthens Constellation's role as a “backbone” for the grid during the transition away from coal.

Critically, Constellation's success hinges on its ability to navigate regulatory and market risks. However, its 98.8% capacity factor in 2025—a record even by its own standards—demonstrates operational resilience that few peers can match. As CEO Joe Dominguez stated in Q2 2025 earnings calls, “Clean and reliable megawatts are the most important energy commodity in the world today”Earnings call transcript: Constellation Energy’s Q2 2025 …[ 3 ]. For investors, this underscores a simple truth: in a world grappling with climate extremes and energy insecurity, reliability is no longer a differentiator—it is a necessity.

Conclusion

Constellation Energy's 2025 performance is more than a corporate milestone—it is a microcosm of the energy transition's next phase. By marrying nuclear reliability with strategic investments, policy advocacy, and partnerships with energy-hungry industries, the company is redefining what clean infrastructure can achieve. For investors seeking high-conviction plays, Constellation's trajectory offers a clear signal: the future of renewable infrastructure will be built on the bedrock of technologies that deliver both sustainability and stability.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd4189e70bc002.png,N,,2025-09-21 00:59:15.503989

ENTEK is recognized as a leading global manufacturer of battery separators, which are essential components in various battery technologies.

The agreement includes I Squared’s significant investment of $800 million, which will be complemented by a substantial loan of up to $1.3 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program. This partnership underscores the vital importance of robust public-private collaborations in bolstering the U.S. domestic manufacturing capabilities of strategic technologies, particularly in light of the growing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions. Initial funding has already been provided, emphasizing the swift movement towards this essential project.

The primary focus of this investment is to finance the construction of a state-of-the-art gigafactory located in Terre Haute, Indiana. This facility will be the first and only of its kind within the United States to produce wet-process lithium-ion battery separators at scale. These separators are not only vital for electric vehicles but also play a crucial role in energy storage systems, defense equipment, and various components of digital infrastructure. Once the facility is fully operational, it is projected to create approximately 763 construction jobs and 635 permanent operational positions, thus significantly contributing to the local economy and job market.

Over the past four decades, ENTEK has developed a resilient and vertically integrated business model, leveraging its core competencies in energy storage, advanced materials development, and specialized equipment manufacturing. The firm has expanded its global footprint, operating in eight countries, and has pioneered the application of advanced materials to cover all battery separator types, including lead-acid, lithium-ion, and other emerging energy storage technologies.

In a conversation with WIBC’s Tony Katz, Braun responded to growing concerns about the cost and environmental impact of large-scale data centers, including a proposed Google facility on the east side of Indianapolis.

“There’s a ton of capital investment and a construction multiplier effect,” Braun said. “But those jobs dissipate once it’s done. After that, it uses a ton of electricity and a decent amount of water to boot.”

He pointed out that in rural counties, where assessed value is often limited, data centers can help expand the tax base. Still, Braun said Indiana isn’t handing out automatic approvals.

“I’m going to measure it based upon what I told you. It’s not a categorical yes or no,” he said. “We want to be open for business, anyone that wants to come here and invest, but if it’s going to have impact, and it’s not along with high-paying jobs, you’ve got to abate many of these out of the gate to where they don’t even get the benefit of local property tax revenue.”

Braun highlighted a new law that requires data centers to pay for 80 percent of the cost of new electricity generation if they haven’t already started construction. He said that’s meant to protect ratepayers from covering the cost of infrastructure needed by energy-hungry facilities.

“That’s where we start,” Braun said. “Then it’s going to be up to the data centers and the utility companies to make the case that it’s going to be neutral in terms of impacting the cost of electricity for everyone else.”

He also weighed in on public frustration over rising utility bills. AES Indiana recently asked for a rate hike, but the state’s consumer counselor pushed back with a recommendation to lower rates instead.

“That rate hike has been too commonplace without taking the other side of the equation into consideration,” Braun said. “It’s mostly to show that you’re not a juggernaut that gets everything you want without discussion.”

Indiana currently generates around 20 gigawatts of electricity, which Braun said is barely enough to keep up with demand. Some data centers, he noted, can consume up to one gigawatt each.

“Demand for electricity was flat as a pancake, and now one of these centers can use up to a gig,” he said. “We’ve got to be careful, especially when it takes four to five years to bring any new generation online.”

Braun also expressed doubts about wind and solar, calling them unreliable and saying grid operators don’t count them as baseload power. Instead, he’s pushing for small modular nuclear reactors and wants to delay shutting down existing fossil fuel plants.

“They check off so many things that make sense in terms of baseload,” Braun said. “That’s going to be there whether the sun’s shining or not, or the wind’s blowing.”

While major cities across the United States embrace “cool roof” standards to combat rising urban temperatures, the Pacific Northwest has yet to implement any policies that could reduce local temperatures, and one woman is trying to change that.

Studies show lighter-colored roofing materials reflect more sunlight compared to dark surfaces, which absorb more heat and contribute to what scientists call an urban heat island.

Katie Kaku is the senior technical director for Global Heat Reductions and is trying to bring awareness to this process and encourage meaningful change in the Pacific Northwest.

“We all know, we’ve all experienced black asphalt on hot summer days and we know it’s hot to the touch. And this is because it’s absorbing the incoming sunlight and rereleasing it as heat,” said Kaku.

Cities can experience as much as 15 degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas due to their built environments, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect.

Katie uses Seattle neighborhoods as an example.

“You can see the temperature differences from neighborhood to neighborhood. A city with lots of trees by the water, such as Ballard or Magnolia, you find that on a hot summer day, if that temperature hits 80 degrees, an area such as Renton or Auburn or Kent within the industrial corridor that has fewer trees and much more black surfaces, those regions can be 11 degrees warmer,” she said.

A “cool roof” can lower the temperature both inside and outside a home, reducing cooling bills for entire communities and cities.

Research from the Environmental Protection Agency shows if “cool roof” standards are implemented, the temperature inside a home can be lowered anywhere from about 2 to 6 degrees.

While many major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, have cool roof standards in place for flat (typically industrial) roofs, Atlanta passed a bold city-wide ordinance in June of 2025 requiring all roofs, both industrial and residential, to comply with these standards.

The city-wide temperature in Atlanta is expected to be lower by 2.4 to 6.3 degrees because of these changes.

As summers get hotter in the Pacific Northwest, Katie would like to see similar standards or guidance from officials.

""To the best of my knowledge, neither Washington nor Oregon have any cool roof ordinances or guidelines in their building code,” she said.

The Cool Roof Rating Council is a nonprofit that aims to bring information related to cool surfaces to critical discussions, and when asked about any cool roof standards in the PNW, a spokesperson shared that:

“The Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard (ESDS), which is the building performance standard that governs affordable housing projects funded through the Washington State Housing Trust Fund program, includes cool roof provisions as part of its heat island reduction credit. This is currently the only standard in the PNW that includes cool roof provisions, though cool roofs are included for heat island mitigation in nation-wide and global voluntary green building programs such as LEED and Green Globes.”

Katie believes the only con to a lighter colored roof would be the aesthetic.

We asked roofing expert Mike Tappert, who owns Upper West Exteriors.

“Black is the most popular I think due to the aesthetic,” said Tappert, adding that if someone wanted to choose a lighter colored roof, “They’re generally all within a couple dollars of each other.”

He said that simply choosing a lighter colored shingle in the northwest would help lower the temperature of your home and community, but an even more powerful “cool roof” shingle has been developed and is sold in warmer climates, which can double those temperature impacts.

“It’s a logical conclusion to come to that if you’re wearing a black t-shirt and you feel warmer versus wearing a nice light white t-shirt in the sun, you’re going to feel a little cooler. It makes sense it would apply to rooftops also which are going to be a huge square footage impact from that heat absorption from the sun,” said Tappert.

Owens Corning, the company that produces the cool roof shingle, could transport to the northwest, there just might be a shipping fee or slight delay for shipping.

Tappert said the only con to using those cool roof shingles in the northwest is that those shingles to not have any built-in algae resistance, which most shingles he sells in Washington have, and that would be the only trade for the cool roof shingles.

However, he said the algae-resistant shingles do have lighter shades that would be beneficial for lower temperatures.

For Kaku, the solution is both homeowners stepping up to choose lighter colors when redoing a roof or building a new home, plus asking city leaders to issue guidance.

""By changing the color choices slightly, we can make meaningful action and address urban heat island effects and reduce temperatures of cities by as much as 2 degrees,"" she said. ""This is a change we can implement right now. Simply by mandating more reflective surfaces, higher albedo building materials, we can make meaningful action right now.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/1187d8ab-58a2-44de-9a61-b3ab04c42e21/20250920T023239/1187d8ab-58a2-44de-9a61-b3ab04c42e21_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 20:59:45.498952

It is expected to last 80 years or more, based on an independent analysis of the West Union network conducted in 2021.
The grants covered the majority of the streetscape project and the entire cost of the $2.2 million geothermal system.
In addition to geothermal heating and cooling, deep, hot-rock geothermal projects that generate steam for electricity production are also seeing increased interest.
“It was years ahead of its time,” said Larry Leliefeld, former president of the Iowa Geothermal Association, an industry group, and the current service provider for the West Union geothermal system.","WEST UNION, Iowa—From the billboard on the edge of town to the limestone monument on Vine Street, the signs are hard to miss: “West Union, Deeply Connected.” It’s a motto that could apply to many tight-knit farm towns across the Midwest where families date back generations.

But in this town of 2,500, the words have additional meaning.

Buried beneath the front lawn of the county courthouse and town square are 132 boreholes, each 300 feet deep. Pipes connected to the bores run below the surrounding blocks, providing downtown businesses with year-round geothermal energy. The high-efficiency, fossil-fuel-free heating and cooling system owned by the town was one of the first municipal thermal networks in the country when it began operating in 2014.

For Steve Fate, the president of West Union District Energy, which oversees the system, its appeal is simple.

“It saves us money, and will continue to save us money,” Fate said, emphasizing the financial benefits of the geothermal system.

In 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy highlighted West Union as having one of the highest-performing geothermal networks among a small but growing number of similar systems in operation nationwide.

“It’s sort of a celebrity among thermal energy networks because it was constructed very early,” said Jessica Silber-Byrne, the thermal energy networks research and communications manager for the Building Decarbonization Coalition, a nonprofit organization working to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in buildings.

The library, county courthouse, a law office, two banks, an insurance company and a shoe store are among the twelve buildings connected to the geothermal system. Each user is part of the energy district, the group that oversees its operation.

The system has underground boreholes that serve as a thermal equalizer. A mixture of water and glycol circulates through pipes in each hole, where underground temperatures remain at approximately 50°Fahrenheit year round. As the water travels through the vertical bores, it is warmed or cooled by the surrounding rock and sediment until it stabilizes at 50 degrees, a temperature well-suited for cooling on hot summer days and a great starting point for heating buildings in the winter months.

A loop of horizontal pipe running beneath six blocks of West Union’s downtown then circulates the ground-temperature water to buildings connected to the system. Heat pumps in each building use compressors and fans to further warm or cool the buildings, depending on the time of year. These water-source heat pumps work the same way as air-source heat pumps that draw on outdoor air for heating and cooling, but are more efficient.

The high-density polyethylene pipe used in the bores and distribution loop is the same type of pipe used by water, sewer and gas utilities. It is expected to last 80 years or more, based on an independent analysis of the West Union network conducted in 2021. The heat pumps located in each building have a life expectancy of up to 24 years according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

In community spaces like the library, the heating and cooling is a public service, Fate said.

“It’s going to be warm today and humid, and we’re going to have community members just coming in here for the day,” said Fate, who is also the president of the West Union Community Library Board of Trustees, during a visit in late June when temperatures would reach 89° Fahrenheit outside. “On our winter days, when it’s 20 below zero, we have people that come in, off and on all day long, because there’s a warm spot to be.”

Perfect Timing

Geothermal heating and cooling is just one of several sustainability projects that West Union completed in the early 2010s as part of a revitalization project that included a complete reconstruction of its downtown streets. Other initiatives included replacing the existing asphalt with porous pavement that lets water seep into the ground and bioswales or rain gardens that slow and filter stormwater runoff. The city worked closely with the Iowa Economic Development Authority, which was looking to fund sustainable pilot projects in towns across the state. The state agency brought outside experts to West Union to discuss options with residents.

“We just basically brainstormed ideas—even if they were off the wall and seemed ridiculous,” said Jon Biederman, a civil engineer who was part of the town’s redevelopment planning team. “Some of those were taken off the table right away, but one that kind of hung on was geothermal.”

Biederman and others in town were familiar with small-scale geothermal energy. Some had ground-source heat pumps connected to one or two boreholes that provided heating and cooling for their homes. Another small-scale system, completed in 2007, provided heating and cooling for the high school’s performing arts center.

During the brainstorming sessions, someone mentioned a much larger thermal energy network in Holland, Michigan, that used waste heat from a nearby power plant to fuel a snowmelt system for streets and sidewalks across much of the city’s downtown.

West Union didn’t have a power plant and the waste heat that comes with it, but its residents decided to pursue geothermal on a similar scale to provide heating and cooling to the town’s business district. The decision was made easier in part by plans to rip up and replace most of the streets downtown. With the ground already exposed, it would be less costly and disruptive to bury water pipes connecting the borefield to nearby buildings.

The town was able to secure state and federal grants driven by stimulus funding following the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The grants covered the majority of the streetscape project and the entire cost of the $2.2 million geothermal system.

“The timing was just right for making the geothermal happen,” Biederman said. “I don’t know that it would have ever happened before that, or probably since. It was just absolutely perfect for timing.”

For the buildings connected to the system, the savings are significant.

Biederman estimated that his engineering firm’s office building saves a few hundred dollars a month with geothermal energy compared to what they would otherwise pay today if they kept their prior heating and cooling systems.

Fate, the library board president, calculated that the building’s costs for heating and cooling have decreased by 25 percent per square foot since the geothermal system was first installed.

Pat Dillon, a local attorney who connected his West Union office building to the town’s geothermal network several years ago, saw his winter heating bill drop nearly in half from $350 to $180 per month.

“It provides consistent, nice heat in the wintertime, and it’s cool in the summertime,” Dillon said. “It’s meeting all of our objectives.”

Learning Curve

As one of the first communities in the country to own and operate such a system, there were challenges early on.

“There weren’t good examples to fall back on, like ‘How do we bill everybody? What does that look like?’” said Robin Bostrom, the former head of the West Union Chamber of Commerce’s Main Street program, an economic revitalization and historic preservation initiative. “They had to kind of wade through that and figure it out.”

Users of the network formed their own limited liability corporation and hired a geothermal service provider to monitor and maintain the system. Initially, costs were high, and the savings from switching to geothermal were minimal. However, a new service provider hired in 2021 provided the same services at a fraction of the cost. The change has allowed the user group to reduce the amount they pay for thermal energy from $14 per ton of heating and cooling capacity in 2021 to $9 per ton today.

When the project was first completed, it was anticipated that it would be a model for the nation. In the early years, the town received a lot of calls about the streetscape and its permeable pavers, but there was little interest in the geothermal system, Biederman said.

That’s beginning to change.

“We used to get a call every once in a while. Now it’s really consistent,” Fate said, noting a group recently visited from Vermont.

Hot water from thermal springs has been used in district heating systems in the U.S. for 150 years, but the West Union network was the first ambient temperature system owned by a municipality, Silber-Byrne of the Building Decarbonization Coalition said.

There are now dozens of neighborhood-scale networks and district energy systems that tap geothermal energy for heating and cooling in operation in the United States, research from the organization indicates. Dozens of additional systems are currently under development.

In addition to geothermal heating and cooling, deep, hot-rock geothermal projects that generate steam for electricity production are also seeing increased interest. New, enhanced geothermal systems that draw on hydraulic fracturing techniques developed by the oil and gas industry and other advanced drilling methods are quickly expanding geothermal energy’s potential.

Silber-Byrne said legislation that allows, or in some cases requires, utilities to install geothermal systems is partly responsible for the uptick in the heating and cooling networks. Twelve states, including those on the West Coast, Midwest, Northeast as well as Colorado and Texas, have passed laws related to geothermal heating and cooling in recent years, according to the organization.

Tax incentives introduced during the Biden administration and largely preserved in the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act are also driving interest in the networks, Silber-Byrne said.

Interest from utilities and communities in using geothermal energy instead of gas as a means to meet their climate goals and protect against natural gas price spikes during periods of peak demand is also spurring new projects.

The biggest challenges to adoption remain unfamiliarity with the systems and their high upfront cost, Silber-Byrne said. While the West Union system was financed entirely by federal grants, some in the community were initially opposed to, and spoke out against, a largely unproven system.

“Either they didn’t have the information they needed, or they were afraid, or we didn’t communicate well enough from the start,” said Dick Woodard, a retired insurance agent who has owned two buildings connected to the system.

“It was years ahead of its time,” said Larry Leliefeld, former president of the Iowa Geothermal Association, an industry group, and the current service provider for the West Union geothermal system. “What it lacked was bringing [people] along and helping them understand it.”

Now, as the West Union geothermal network enters its second decade of operation and its user rates decrease while gas and electric rates climb, more local businesses are considering connecting their buildings to the existing network, Fate said.

The local elementary school in West Union recently installed its own geothermal system.

“It’s kind of like church,” Woodard said. “If you want to change the hymns, then you are going to have somebody squawking about it. That’s the way it was here. You get past it.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Iowa-Geothermal_Deeply-Connected1_McKennaJPG-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 21:59:34.279504

Its ability to generate electricity without emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels makes it a key player against climate change. However, behind each wind turbine lies a complex engineering work that seeks to balance efficiency, stability, and sustainability.

For decades, the three-blade model dominated the industry by offering an adequate compromise between aerodynamics, mechanical resistance, and reliability. Each additional blade provides less performance, and adding more than three generates overweight and wind resistance, reducing efficiency. That is why manufacturers have opted for the triad as a worldwide standard.

From a mechanical point of view, three blades allow for distributing loads evenly, reducing vibrations, and extending the lifespan of the equipment. Wind turbines also have Yaw brakes, systems that orient the rotor towards the wind and protect it from extreme gusts, providing an extra layer of safety.

On the other hand, designs with one or two blades historically faced stability and durability issues, requiring additional parts that increased costs and complicated manufacturing. However, recent innovation is challenging this trend and opening up new possibilities to diversify turbine models.

Wind energy.

The challenge of two blades: innovation and efficiency

The company Envision Energy surprised the sector by presenting a two-blade (2B) wind turbine that has managed to overcome traditional obstacles. With over 500 days of stable operation, it achieved levels of availability and operating hours comparable to three-blade models.

This advancement is due to a modular and lightweight design that reduces structural mass and simplifies assembly logistics. It also integrates active controls, lightweight materials such as carbon fiber shafts, and advanced technology to ensure dynamic stability. Thus, the vibration and wear issues that previously limited bi-blade turbines seem to be a thing of the past.

The two-blade model offers clear economic advantages. By reducing the rotor’s weight by 15–20%, manufacturing and transportation costs decrease. It is even possible to mount the rotor and the nacelle together, simplifying operations in remote areas. Although its aerodynamic efficiency may be up to 5% lower, the cost-benefit balance makes it attractive for projects in complex environments.

In emerging markets, where logistical conditions hinder the installation of conventional turbines, this design can make a difference. Its adaptability makes it a strategic option to accelerate the expansion of wind energy in isolated regions and support global commitments to decarbonization.

The environmental benefits of wind energy

Beyond technological innovation, the true value of wind energy lies in its environmental impact. By generating electricity from the wind, it avoids the burning of fossil fuels responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. Each operational wind turbine can offset thousands of tons of CO₂ throughout its lifespan.

Another key benefit is the reduction of air pollution. Unlike thermal plants, wind energy does not produce smoke, particles, or toxic waste, contributing to improving the quality of life in nearby communities. Moreover, as a renewable and inexhaustible source, it offers energy security in the long term.

The installation of wind farms also promotes local development, creating jobs and fostering more sustainable regional economies. In combination with other clean energies, wind power emerges as one of the most effective solutions to mitigate climate change and build a more just and balanced energy future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/09/turbina.webp,N,,2025-09-20 22:59:34.512649

American ratepayers have seen electricity prices rising at a faster pace than U.S. inflation over the past three years. These increases are set to outpace the rate of inflation through 2026, the Energy Information Administration says.

At the same time, the United States has never produced more energy than now, with a record amount in 2024 and rising output of oil and natural gas in 2025, too.

The abundance of energy could help lower electric utility bills for consumers—if there is enough gas linked to powering data centers and manufacturing, the primary growth drivers of U.S. power demand.

Eventually, the spiking energy costs will lead to the various U.S. states approving additional gas infrastructure, EQT Corp, one of America’s top natural gas producers, reckons.

“We’ve never produced more energy than we’re producing now, but Americans’ energy bills are up over 35%,” EQT’s chief executive Toby Rice said during BloombergNEF’s ‘Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI’ summit in Houston this week.

“That’s the catalyst that’s going to get people asking questions,” the executive added.

His opinion that additional infrastructure, most of all gas, will help bring down elevated consumer energy bills was shared by Cynthia Hansen, Executive Vice President & President, Gas Transmission & Midstream at pipeline giant Enbridge, and Chris James, founder and chief investment officer at Engine No.1, an investment firm.

Big Tech is scouting for sites in these states amid rising interest to build data centers there to take advantage of the nearby gas supply and friendlier regulatory environment, Hansen said at the BNEF summit.

So far this decade, gas infrastructure development has been shunned due to opposition by U.S. states to host more pipelines and the Biden Administration’s pivot to supporting renewable energy and telling oil and gas companies they are things of the past.

Overview of the Current Energy Landscape

The current energy landscape is characterized by a growing demand for clean and sustainable energy sources. As climate change continues to pose significant threats to our planet, there is an urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy alternatives. However, many communities, particularly those in rural or low-income areas, face barriers to accessing these resources.

High upfront costs, lack of infrastructure, and limited technical expertise often hinder their ability to adopt renewable energy solutions. Moreover, traditional energy systems are often centralized, leaving many communities vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices and supply disruptions. This reliance on external sources can exacerbate existing inequalities and limit opportunities for local economic development.

In contrast, CBREBs offer a decentralized model that empowers communities to generate their own energy, reducing dependence on external providers and fostering self-sufficiency. By leveraging local resources and knowledge, these banks can create a more resilient energy system that benefits all community members.

Objectives and Goals of the Grant Proposal

The primary objective of this grant proposal is to establish Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks in targeted communities to promote sustainable energy practices and enhance local resilience. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following goals: 1. Increase access to renewable energy sources for underserved communities by developing localized energy production systems.

2.

Foster community engagement and participation in the planning and implementation of renewable energy projects.

3. Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for community members to develop technical skills related to renewable energy technologies.

4. Promote economic development by creating green jobs and stimulating local economies through the establishment of CBREBs.

By focusing on these objectives, we aim to create a sustainable energy model that not only addresses immediate energy needs but also contributes to long-term community development.

Implementation Plan for Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks

The implementation plan for establishing Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks will involve several key phases. First, we will conduct a comprehensive needs assessment in the target communities to identify specific energy challenges and opportunities. This assessment will involve engaging with local stakeholders, including community members, local government officials, and potential partners, to gather input and build support for the project.

Once the needs assessment is complete, we will develop a tailored project plan that outlines the specific renewable energy technologies to be implemented, such as solar panels or wind turbines. We will also establish partnerships with local organizations and experts to provide technical assistance and training throughout the project lifecycle. Community workshops will be organized to educate residents about renewable energy options and encourage their active participation in the project.

The next phase will involve securing funding and resources for the project implementation. This may include applying for grants, seeking donations from local businesses, or exploring crowdfunding options. Once funding is secured, we will begin the installation of renewable energy systems in collaboration with community members.

Throughout this process, we will prioritize transparency and communication to ensure that all stakeholders are informed and engaged.

Budget and Funding Requirements

To successfully implement Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks, a detailed budget will be developed outlining all anticipated costs associated with the project. This budget will include expenses related to equipment procurement, installation, training programs, community engagement activities, and ongoing maintenance of renewable energy systems. We estimate that the total budget for establishing CBREBs in our target communities will be approximately $500,000.

This figure includes costs for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries for energy storage, training materials, and personnel expenses for project coordinators and trainers. To secure funding for this initiative, we will pursue various avenues such as government grants, private foundations focused on renewable energy or community development, and partnerships with local businesses willing to invest in sustainable initiatives. In addition to external funding sources, we will explore opportunities for community contributions through volunteer labor or small financial investments from residents who wish to participate in the project.

By fostering a sense of ownership among community members, we can enhance the sustainability of the CBREBs while also building local capacity.

Expected Impact and Benefits of the Project

The establishment of Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks is expected to yield significant positive impacts on both the environment and the local economy. By increasing access to renewable energy sources, we anticipate a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in reliance on fossil fuels within the target communities. This shift towards cleaner energy will contribute to global efforts to combat climate change while also improving air quality and public health.

Economically, CBREBs have the potential to create green jobs in areas such as installation, maintenance, and operation of renewable energy systems. By providing training opportunities for community members, we can equip them with valuable skills that enhance their employability and contribute to local economic growth. Additionally, by generating their own energy, communities can reduce their utility costs and redirect those savings towards other essential services or initiatives.

Socially, the project aims to foster greater community cohesion by encouraging collaboration among residents and local organizations. As community members work together towards a common goal of sustainable energy production, they will build stronger relationships and develop a sense of pride in their collective achievements. Ultimately, CBREBs can serve as a model for other communities seeking to adopt similar approaches to renewable energy.

Evaluation and Monitoring Plan

To ensure the success of Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks, a robust evaluation and monitoring plan will be implemented throughout the project lifecycle. This plan will include both qualitative and quantitative measures to assess progress towards our objectives and goals. We will establish key performance indicators (KPIs) related to energy production levels, community engagement rates, job creation figures, and participant satisfaction with training programs.

Regular data collection will be conducted through surveys, interviews, and focus groups with community members to gather feedback on their experiences with the project. Additionally, we will conduct periodic assessments of the renewable energy systems’ performance to ensure they are operating efficiently and meeting community needs. This ongoing monitoring will allow us to identify any challenges or areas for improvement promptly.

By maintaining transparency in our evaluation process, we can build trust with stakeholders and demonstrate the impact of our efforts.

Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks present an innovative solution to address the pressing energy needs of underserved communities while promoting sustainability and economic development. By empowering local residents to take control of their energy resources, we can create a more resilient and equitable energy landscape. As we move forward with this grant proposal, our next steps will involve finalizing partnerships with local organizations, conducting needs assessments in target communities, and developing a detailed project timeline.

We are committed to engaging community members throughout this process to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are prioritized. With your support, we can turn this vision into reality and pave the way for a brighter future powered by clean, renewable energy for all. Together, we can build stronger communities that thrive on sustainability and resilience.",https://fundsforngosmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/19141120/icon.png,N,,2025-09-20 20:59:31.778073

According to Iraqi media cited by Al Jazeera, the facility—set to open on Sunday—will be the country’s largest solar power plant and is expected to eventually produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity at peak capacity.

The plant is located on approximately 4,000 dunams (1,000 acres or 400 hectares) in the al-Hur desert region of Karbala, southwest of Baghdad. The site features tens of thousands of solar panels arranged in systematic rows.

Nasser Karim al-Sudani, head of the national solar energy team in the Iraqi prime minister’s office, said additional projects are already in the pipeline. A second solar plant under construction in Babil province is expected to generate 225 megawatts, while a much larger 1,000-megawatt project is planned for the southern province of Basra.

“These initiatives are part of a broader vision to meet a portion of Iraq’s energy needs through large-scale solar power, easing the strain on the national grid while also reducing harmful gas emissions,” Al Jazeera quoted officials as saying.

Deputy Minister of Electricity Adel Karim stated that Iraq currently has solar energy projects with a combined capacity of 12,500 megawatts in various stages of development—from implementation and approval to negotiation. Excluding the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, these projects could potentially supply up to 20 percent of Iraq’s total electricity demand, he added.

Despite its abundant oil and gas reserves, Iraq has faced persistent electricity shortages for decades, driven by years of conflict, widespread corruption, and poor infrastructure management. This summer, national power consumption surged to nearly 55,000 megawatts, while temperatures in parts of the country exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122°F), Al Jazeera reported.

In contrast, Iraq currently produces around 28,000 megawatts of electricity, with nearly 8,000 megawatts sourced from Iranian natural gas used in domestic power plants. However, these imports have frequently been disrupted—partly due to U.S. sanctions on Tehran. In March, Washington revoked a sanctions waiver that had allowed Iraq to purchase electricity directly from Iran, although another waiver remains in place for natural gas imports.

Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.
In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.
Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.","This story was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.

In a brief filed on Monday in a federal court in Burlington, the administration said the policy was “unlawful on its face” and pushed the court to “end Vermont’s lawless experiment.”

“The Court should deny the motions to dismiss, grant the United States’ motion for summary judgment, declare the Superfund Act unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to implement or enforce it,” Riley Walters, counsel to an acting assistant attorney general, wrote in the motion.

Passed in 2024, the Vermont policy — known as the Climate Superfund Act — requires major polluters to pay for their carbon emissions, which have warmed the planet and increased the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as the floods which wreaked $1 billion in damage on the state last year. New York passed a similar measure in December.

“This law is about holding Big Oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s climate superfund law. “Vermont is well within its rights to protect its people in this way.”

The filing comes four months after the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency sued Vermont and New York over the laws. In August, the state and two nonprofits who were granted intervenor status, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.

“Let’s be clear: This law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions, punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” she said. “This is Vermont using its legal right to raise revenue and protect the health, safety, and well-being of its residents from the ruinous, inescapable consequences of climate change.”

The motion is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to quash climate accountability efforts and environmental regulations. In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.

In July, the administration proposed undoing the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which says planet-warming emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act – the most audacious of more than 150 environmental rollbacks launched since Trump retook office in January.

Jamie Henn, director of the anti-fossil fuel nonprofit Fossil Free Media, which backs the superfund laws, said Trump’s assault would not deter efforts to bring about financial accountability for global warming. Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VermontFlooding.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-20 20:01:33.469502

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the US sustainable fuels market.
Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.
Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.
In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4mn worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.","A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to US airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat — called tallow — into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the US sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3bn in US tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9bn in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239bn global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

In 2022 Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557mn acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4mn worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner Antonio Lucena Barros still owes over $3mn in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value — less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation. — Reuters",https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2025/09/20/359481.JPG,N,,2025-09-20 19:00:53.059269

Game-Changing Benefits for Stellantis Brands

The integrated battery system represents a significant advancement in EV technology that could benefit multiple Stellantis brands across North America. Jeep's current 4xe lineup, including the Grand Cherokee 4xe with its 26-mile electric range and Wrangler 4xe offering 21 miles of electric-only driving, could see meaningful improvements with IBIS technology implementation.

A 10% efficiency boost would translate to approximately 2.6 additional miles of electric range for the Grand Cherokee 4xe and over 2 miles for the Wrangler 4xe. While these gains might seem modest, they represent meaningful improvements where every mile of electric range reduces reliance on gasoline. The weight reduction of 88 pounds also improves overall efficiency. Dodge's Charger EVs could also benefit from up to 30 miles of additional range and space savings, while Ram's recently shelved electric pickup truck could have leveraged the faster charging capabilities and reduced complexity.

Too Little, Too Late?

Traditional EVs use separate onboard chargers that convert grid AC power to DC for battery storage, while onboard inverters convert battery DC power to AC for electric motors. By consolidating these functions into the battery pack itself, Stellantis creates opportunities for simplified vehicle assembly, reduced manufacturing costs, and improved reliability. The technology also improves Stellantis' position against Tesla and Ford in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The IBIS technology could prove valuable as Stellantis accelerates its electrification timeline across brands like Dodge, which plans to transition its performance lineup to electric power. The system's ability to provide faster charging and higher efficiency while maintaining smaller packaging requirements addresses two critical consumer concerns about EV adoption. Stellantis says the technology should see production before 2030, but really, it can’t come soon enough.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/ca6b1986e2fcd5473ee29a8863c258a9,N,,2025-09-21 09:59:48.294206

SENATE

Reviewing Nominees Slate

The Senate on Sept. 15, by a 51-44 vote, passed a resolution (S. Res. 377), sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), for the en bloc consideration of a set of 48 nominees for executive branch positions, including several ambassadorships and an array of senior roles in the military and other federal agencies. Thune said en bloc consideration was necessary because Democratic senators had, unprecedentedly, refused to confirm any of the president’s nominees by unanimous consent or voice vote, and the resulting need to invoke cloture and have recorded votes on each nominee “ties up the Senate floor, preventing us from considering important legislation.”

In March, Miran became chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers. He was a policy advisor at the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration, then a strategist at a private investment firm and fellow at the Manhattan Institute. An opponent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said confirming Miran would allow President Trump “to succeed in this next phase of his very public, very obvious, months-long campaign to stack the Fed with loyalists who will prioritize Trump’s personal whims over America’s long-term economic health.”

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), that would have nullified and voided an Environmental Protection Agency rule issued in May that increased allowed levels of nitrogen oxide emissions from Indiana power plants during the summer months. Whitehouse said the rule, by clearing the way for coal-fired power plants to remain in operation, would endanger public health by increasing levels of smog, which “causes lung disease, it causes cardiovascular problems, and it even causes reproductive issues.” A resolution opponent, Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), called the rule “merely a housekeeping correction that lines up the state limit with active generation so unrealistic, retroactive costs aren’t forced on power plants and ultimately the ratepayer.”

“The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.
Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.","NEW YORK — Thousands of activists marched down Park Avenue and turned down Billionaires Row toward Trump Tower in New York Saturday to “Make Billionaires Pay,” calling for climate justice, democracy, free speech, gender equality, a stop to the Trump's immigration crackdown and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people's lives.

“I don't see them as movements. I don't see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,"" said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone's headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women's March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that's the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her six-year-old daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,"" it read.

“It's all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don't have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we're not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

Consumer Reports' 2025 EV satisfaction index shows a dip: Only 45% of buyers cite ""excitement"" as a factor, down from 62% in 2022.","The electric vehicle (EV) dream in the United States was supposed to be a high-octane thrill ride. President Biden's administration promised a transformative infrastructure push, including a sprawling network of fast-charging stations to blanket the nation. Yet, as of mid-2025, that vision remains more mirage than reality. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $7.5 billion for EV chargers, aiming for 500,000 stations by 2030. THAT, never happened, Man, was THAT a fail of EPIC proportion!

Compounding the frustration is the charging experience itself: a touch-and-go ordeal that turns road trips into endurance tests. Imagine pulling into a station after hours of white-knuckled range monitoring, only to find half the stalls occupied by gas-guzzlers or malfunctioning units spitting error codes. Surveys from AAA in 2024 revealed 60% of EV owners report anxiety over charging reliability, with downtime averaging 20% during peak times. It's not just inconvenient; it's a buzzkill for the eco-warrior fantasy.

Then there's the lineup of EVs themselves. Where's the sizzle? Tesla's Cybertruck and Rivian's R1T were supposed to ignite lust, but high prices—often north of $80,000—keep them niche and in our opinion, neither is a MUST-HAVE.

Mainstream models like the Chevy Bolt refresh or Ford Mustang Mach-E updates feel iterative, not revolutionary. Consumer Reports' 2025 EV satisfaction index shows a dip: Only 45% of buyers cite ""excitement"" as a factor, down from 62% in 2022. Without jaw-dropping designs or must-have features—like affordable sub-$30,000 options or seamless autonomy—EVs risk blending into the beige sedan crowd. Sales reflect this: EV market share stalled at 7.6% in Q2 2025, per Cox Automotive, as hybrids steal the spotlight.

So, how does the EV shake off this 'meh' funk?

Innovation is the spark. Automakers need to deliver crave-worthy rides: But NONE are coming that we can see to turn this around.

Until, they figure it out which we don’t think they will, we’re all stuck idling and Tesla is running further and further away.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week.
2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules.
“The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.
Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.","New York — Thousands of activists marched down Park Avenue and turned down Billionaires Row toward Trump Tower in New York Saturday to “Make Billionaires Pay,” calling for climate justice, democracy, free speech, gender equality, a stop to the Trump's immigration crackdown and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people's lives.

“I don't see them as movements. I don't see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,"" said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone's headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women's March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that's the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her six-year-old daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,"" it read.

“It's all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don't have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we're not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

By investing in widespread adoption of distributed energy now, North Carolina can build a stronger, more dependable energy system that is flexible in a crisis and able to help avert prolonged outages.
And because distributed energy sources are decentralized, they can be scaled to meet the unique needs of North Carolina, from mountain towns in the west to coastal cities in the east.
Hurricane Helene was a wake-up call for communities that assumed that their distance from the coast protected them from hurricanes.
After Hurricane Helene, this microgrid supplied power to Hot Springs for six days before the main grid was restored.","In Mills River, community members recently came together for AMPlify Appalachia to celebrate — with live music and craft beer — their energy and resilience since Hurricane Helene swept through North Carolina nearly a year ago.

After the hurricane caused 108 deaths and more than $60 billion in damage, AMPlify Appalachia offered people a space where they could process a year filled with heartbreak and uncertainty. It also highlighted a growing community that is committed not only to recovery but also to building a more resilient future.

In the wake of Hurricane Helene, creation of reliable energy systems was both an urgent necessity and long-term challenge. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, distributed energy resources (DERs) proved vital in delivering lifesaving power to remote, storm-ravaged areas in the western mountains of North Carolina, where downed lines were difficult to access and repair. Thanks to organizations such as the Footprint Project, a solar microgrid at a fire station was used to run refrigerators, freezers, and communications; an atmospheric water generator was set up to keep relief teams hydrated without relying on single-use bottled water; and portable power stations were established to help residents in need of emergency medical care.

Distributed energy, which can generate, store, and deliver electricity independently from the main grid, is a highly effective way to keep electricity flowing and mitigate the risk of outages. DERs, which include battery storage, solar panels, electric vehicles, and smart thermostats, allow households, schools, hospitals, and communities to produce and store their own energy without relying solely on distant power plants. These consumer- and community-based energy resources ease strain on the central grid and can operate when storms knock the grid out.

Today, more than 60 operational DER projects support communities across Western North Carolina, proving that these weren’t one-time fixes — they are the building blocks of long-term resilience. But there is more to do. By investing in widespread adoption of distributed energy now, North Carolina can build a stronger, more dependable energy system that is flexible in a crisis and able to help avert prolonged outages. And because distributed energy sources are decentralized, they can be scaled to meet the unique needs of North Carolina, from mountain towns in the west to coastal cities in the east.

Hurricane Helene was a wake-up call for communities that assumed that their distance from the coast protected them from hurricanes. It was also a sobering sign of what’s to come.

Extreme weather events like Helene are expected to become more frequent and more destructive. Just weeks ago, the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal caused flash flooding that closed Interstate 40, damaged homes and businesses, killed six people, and prompted numerous water rescues.

At the same time, energy demand in North Carolina is rapidly growing, not only among individuals and households but also from data centers and other commercial users. Our electricity grid is at risk of being overwhelmed. According to consulting firm ICF International, electricity demand in the United States is projected to grow 25% by 2030 —the fastest rate in over 70 years.

Because the grid is not built for this double threat, we can expect more disruptions, longer blackouts, and higher monthly energy costs for the average North Carolina resident. But fortunately, the Tar Heel State has been planning for a future with new, reliable, affordable energy options. For example, Duke Energy’s microgrid in the mountain town of Hot Springs offers a model for resilience that is similar to the work done through the Footprint Project. In 2023, Duke installed a solar and battery storage microgrid at the utility’s substation to serve as backup power for the town. After Hurricane Helene, this microgrid supplied power to Hot Springs for six days before the main grid was restored.

State officials, utilities, and local leaders have an opportunity — and a responsibility — to prioritize policies and programs that create a more reliable and affordable electric system through the use of distributed energy as they plan for North Carolina’s energy future.

The road to recovery in Western North Carolina is long, but with tools such as solar and battery storage, this region is leading the way, not just in rebuilding, but in redefining what resilience looks like.

My mom and dad didn't drink or smoke but both died from cancer before their 70th birthdays. When I asked their oncologist in Pittsburgh why they might have contracted cancer, his reply was, “They grew up in the Ohio River Valley when air and water pollution were unregulated.”

During the 1940s, the Ohio River was used as an industrial sewer and smoke blanketed the Ohio River Valley; at times even blocking out the sun.

President Nixon recognized the need to address these issues, saying we should “make peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, land, and water.” He signed into law several environmental regulations, including: the National Environmental Policy Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the creation of the Legacy of Parks program. The life-saving policies of Nixon’s administration are being eroded away by an administration that denies science and scientific studies.

On March 12, Trump’s head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced the “most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” Thirty-one acts of legislation that were created to protect human health and the environment are now being abolished in favor of industry profits. One of the rollbacks includes the 2009 Endangerment Finding which states that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act and that these gases pose a significant danger to human health.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding is backed by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence. Last week, Trump’s EPA announced it will no longer require polluting industries to report their air emissions and is tossing out PFAS limits that protect drinking water.

Ohio’s politicians also fail to protect Ohioans as they continue to ignore the documented health and environmental effects from fracking. Citizens question the ability of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to protect drinking water from toxic brine injected into Class II wells. Now Ohio communities are being targeted for data centers, which will be powered by fracked gas. This means more destruction of ecosystems and communities in SE Ohio, as well as the communities that will host these enormous water-hogging, energy-hogging data centers.

Our home is located less than a mile from a fracking operation. We spent the better part of the summer listening to the sound of drilling and fracking; the sounds of nature were obliterated. Additionally, roads surrounding the well pad saw a steady barrage of sand, water and toxic radioactive brine trucks.

Governor DeWine is fooling himself if he thinks fracking state parks won't affect tourism or the health of local communities; it has and will continue to do so.

What's happening?

Cox Automotive exclusively shared data with Reuters that revealed Tesla's U.S. market share has dipped to its lowest level in nearly eight years at 38% — a far cry from the 80% share it once held.

This is the first time Tesla's share has fallen below 40% since 2017, when the Model 3 became its first mass-market car and inspired a greater number of consumers to switch to EVs.

""I know they're positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you're a car company, when you don't have new products, your share will start to decline,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, told Reuters.

Why is this important?

While CEO Elon Musk has remained bullish on his robotics and AI aspirations, Tesla's talent exodus and Musk's history of overpromising and underdelivering have spooked investors.

Musk's political involvement also caused a segment of consumers to associate Tesla with Musk's personal views rather than the EVs, contributing to declining sales numbers. Other EV makers had already been attracting buyers away from Tesla, but they have also benefited from this upheaval, leaving Tesla with a smaller piece of the pie.

What does this mean for the EV market?

Even though Tesla — whose name is synonymous with EVs — is facing reputational challenges, Cox's data showed that new EV sales leaped 24% month over month in July, per Reuters. The following month, as Tesla's growth lagged at 3.1%, the EV market grew by 14%.

Hyundai, Honda, Kia, and Toyota were key automakers turning up the heat on Tesla, offering more robust incentives to consumers scrambling to purchase EVs before October.

In addition to helping make cities healthier because they don't release tailpipe pollution, EVs offer long-term savings on energy and maintenance. This makes EVs attractive to consumers, regardless of their opinion about the brand largely responsible for making them mainstream.

""These legacy manufacturers are all benefiting from this sense of urgency, and they're able to have attractive offerings for their vehicles — and it's working,"" Streaty told Reuters.

A 100-megawatt molten salt solar thermal section of the project has adopted advanced Linear Fresnel technology — one of the most advanced solar thermal power generation methods, using the principles of light reflection and refraction to convert solar thermal energy into electricity. It can generate 148 million kilowatt-hours of clean power annually, which will reduce carbon emissions by 1.3 million tonnes.

“Through this technology, molten salt acts like a super ‘power bank,’ storing heat collected from 260,000 mirrors under the sun during the day and generating power at night, enabling continuous electricity generation and lowering costs,” said Huang Longfei, a deputy manager of the project’s solar thermal section.

Xinjiang, the largest provincial-level administrative region in China, has abundant solar and wind resources.

As China has been striving to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, an increasing number of Chinese companies are developing clean energy in Xinjiang, driving the region’s green development, bringing employment and contributing to the country’s dual-carbon goals.

According to a white paper issued last year, clean energy accounted for 26.4 percent of China’s total energy use in 2023 — up from 15.5 percent in 2013 — and the share of coal in its energy consumption has dropped by 12.1 percentage points over the past decade.

Electricity generated from clean energy has accounted for more than half of the increase in the country’s total electricity consumption over the past decade, demonstrating the growing share green energy has in its energy mix.

Eyeing the potential for the wind power industry in the region, wind turbine manufacturer Yuexin Green Energy Group has invested 4 billion yuan (about 562 million U.S. dollars) to build an assembly line and a blade production base in Xinjiang’s Turpan City.

According to the group’s general manager Qiu Yong, the city’s central location within Xinjiang’s major wind power zones helps cut transport costs.

Qiu also highlighted the company’s strategic focus on Central Asian markets. “We received an order for 200 wind turbines from Kazakhstan soon after construction of the blade production base began last year,” he said, adding that the two facilities have opened some 2,000 jobs.

But big changes are coming for EV drivers, and anyone thinking about buying one, starting at the end of September. Starting October 1, EV owners in Arizona will lose access to the HOV lane, along with the federal $7,500 tax credit that helped many buyers afford their first electric car.

Plugging in has become commonplace. Electric vehicles, or EVs, now come in all shapes and sizes and are produced by nearly every major automaker.

Peter Culin bought his first EV 14 years ago, motivated by environmental concerns.

“The future of our planet depends on a lot of things. But if we can do anything possible to help improve the conditions, improve air quality, it’s better for everybody,” Culin said.

The “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed earlier this summer, ended the long-standing tax incentive. Republican lawmakers argued the credit primarily benefited wealthy Americans and did little to reduce emissions, while the majority of U.S. electricity is still generated from fossil fuels.

Despite the loss of the federal tax break, local utilities like SRP are continuing their EV customer charging incentives.

“EVs have zero tailpipe emissions, so they are more environmentally friendly that way, more sustainable,” said Jason Smith of Salt River Project.

For Culin, the end of the incentives won’t change his decision to stick with electric.

“Even on dirty grids, Electric vehicles will outperform on tailpipe emissions and carbon emissions than any gas car,” Culin said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8f6695/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1276x670+0+13/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2F2a%2F2b8f1e9c4f6ea827c4d4979fb21d%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-20-at-1-22-32-pm.png,N,,2025-09-20 17:00:13.789048

“The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people’s lives.

“I don’t see them as movements. I don’t see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,” said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone’s headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women’s March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that’s the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her young daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,” it read.

“It’s all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don’t have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we’re not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

US President Donald Trump’s administration is on a mission to weaken China’s global network of ports and bring more strategic terminals under Western control, according to three sources familiar with the plan.The drive is part of the most ambitious effort to expand US maritime influence since the 1970s and is designed to address growing fears in Washington that it would be at a disadvantage to China in the event of a conflict.Trump administration officials believe the US commercial shipping fleet is ill-equipped to provide logistical support for the military in time of war and Washington’s dependence on foreign ships and ports is excessive, the people said.Options the White House is considering include supporting private US or Western firms to buy Chinese stakes in ports, the three people said. They did not mention any specific firms other than to cite BlackRock’s proposed deal to buy the port assets of Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison in 23 countries, including by the Panama Canal, as a good example.The sources asked not to be named because they are not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.The White House and US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.Besides Panama, US officials and lawmakers are concerned about Chinese maritime infrastructure holdings in places including Greece and Spain, the Caribbean, and US West Coast ports, according to the sources.China conducts normal co-operation with other countries within the framework of international law, a spokesperson with China’s diplomatic mission in Washington said.“China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction and moves that infringe on and undermine other countries’ legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying,” the spokesperson said.Officials in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.“The US government sees Chinese investments in global ports as a huge threat to its national security,” said Stuart Poole-Robb, founder of risk and intelligence advisers KCS Group.“The concern is that China could leverage its control over these assets for espionage, military advantage or to disrupt supply chains during geopolitical crises,” he said, citing conversations with US security counterparts.Greek Port in focusThe US intends to look at Chinese interests in the Greek port of Piraeus, the three sources said.

While the designation does not involve immediate bans on US companies doing business with those listed, it can act as a signal that further action is being considered.“The United States intends to attack China’s international influence by exaggerating the ‘China threat theory’ and use this as an excuse to force allies to take sides in supply chain arrangements,” the Development Research Center of the State Council, an official think-tank of China’s governing cabinet, said in a paper published last month.The US administration has unveiled measures to increase America’s thin commercial maritime presence around the world, including by encouraging domestic shipbuilding, is looking to expand access to US-controlled shipping registries, and is also reviewing global maritime chokepoints for shipping risks.China owns or leases an extensive network of ports through companies including COSCO and other state-controlled enterprises such as China Merchants and SIPG in Shanghai.According to a report published last year by the Council of Foreign Relations, a US think-tank, China had investments in 129 port projects worldwide through various companies, as of August 2024.China’s shipbuilding industry is also estimated to be 230 times larger than US shipyard capacity, meaning it could take decades to catch up, according to US Navy estimates.The US maritime push has contributed to tensions with Beijing, which sees port and shipping assets as integral to its Belt and Road initiative, at a time when the two superpowers are already at loggerheads over trade and tariffs.Mediterranean Gateway under reviewIn March, the US Federal Maritime Commission launched a review of seven maritime chokepoints. It said it wanted to identify regulations, policies or practices “that create unfavourable shipping conditions”.The Strait of Gibraltar, which separates Spain from Africa at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, was one such waterway the review is examining.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has sought to deepen trade ties with China and this has raised concerns in Washington over Beijing’s access to its ports, two of the sources said.“We are not aware of any alleged concerns or approaches by third parties on this matter and therefore it is not appropriate for us to comment,” a Spanish foreign ministry spokesperson said when asked for comment about Chinese port investments.COSCO has concessions to operate container terminals in Valencia and Bilbao, a Spanish Port Authority spokesperson said.Trump has taken numerous steps since returning to the White House to boost US influence over the seas.He signed an executive order in April to revive shipbuilding capacity to expand the fleet of US-controlled vessels.His administration is examining a proposal to establish a shipping registry in the US Virgin Islands that could attract vessels to a US-controlled flag without having to meet the stricter standards of the domestic US registry.The US is poised to start hitting Chinese-built or Chinese-flagged vessels with fees for calling at US ports.And Trump has also flagged seizing the semi-autonomous Danish territory of Greenland as an objective, due to its proximity to the Arctic and key shipping lanes.Together, this all adds up to the most ambitious effort by the US to improve its position in global shipping since President Richard Nixon, who tried to bolster domestic shipbuilding, the commercial ship registry, and US sea power, the sources familiar with the plans said.“The US in the short to medium term is likely to continue its efforts to counter Chinese influence in the key port areas by building alliances and partnerships to counter Chinese power and economic growth,” said Poole-Robb at KCS.Caribbean shipping concernsThe United States has expressed concern too about Chinese investment in Jamaica’s Kingston terminal, a key maritime transhipment hub in the Caribbean due to its location and deep-water port facilities, according to the three sources.China Merchants has a stake in the company operating Kingston’s container terminal together with France’s CMA CGM.

A new report from the nonprofit Rewiring America suggests home energy upgrades like solar power, batteries and heat pumps can offset the electricity demand from data centers.

The report cites data from the firm Aterio that the grid will need 93 gigawatts of additional power by 2029 for data centers that are announced or currently under construction. That’s about as much power as the state of California. Researchers at Rewiring America, which advocates for renewable energy and electrifying transportation and home appliances, estimate that installing rooftop solar, at-home batteries and upgrading electric heating and air conditioning could yield enough electricity gains to meet 100% of the data center demand.

The nonprofit has spent $500,000 on lobbying firms so far in 2025, according to OpenSecrets.

Cora Wyent, head of research and data science at Rewiring America, told Straight Arrow News the present moment is a “crossroads in the energy transition,” adding that “we have a choice to make about how we meet that increase in electricity demand.”

Across America, utility companies are asking state regulators to approve rate increases. Many are also making plans to build new gas power plants to meet demand from data centers. Instead of relying on new power plants, Wyent said she hopes to spark a conversation about investing in households as essential energy infrastructure, which could save consumers money. Some analysts, however, expressed doubts that home energy upgrades can make a difference against data center demand.

How did Rewiring America conduct its analysis?

Rewiring America built its findings on a state-by-state analysis of residential electricity demand and grid capacity. The organization examined the peak electricity demand on the grid and calculated how household upgrades could reduce that load.

The researchers then modeled three types of high-efficiency heat pump installations: upgrading electric resistance heating, replacing central air conditioning and converting electric resistance water heaters to heat pump water heaters. For each state, they determined which upgrade would deliver the most grid capacity and used that as their heat pump solution.

For solar and storage, the analysis modeled adding a five-kilowatt solar system to every American home with a suitable roof — about 81% of single-family homes nationally — and paired it with a home battery roughly the size of a Tesla Powerwall. The report calculated how much these installations could reduce stress on the grid during peak demand by generating and storing electricity during off-peak hours, then discharging it when demand surges.

“There’s a solution to the capacity needs that data centers have on the grid that can be widely beneficial to households across the country,” Wyent said.

‘No way you can do it fast enough’

Although experts agree that there are benefits to energy efficiency upgrades and distributed resources like batteries and rooftop solar, the report’s conclusion that these upgrades can meet data center demand has been met with skepticism.

“It seems like you’re swimming against a really big current,” Doug Sheridan, a veteran of the pipeline industry and managing director of EnergyPoint Research. “There’s no way you can do it fast enough,” Sheridan told SAN, expressing doubts over how fast home batteries and solar can be installed.

Sheridan also pointed out that many of the policies Rewiring America supports, such as drivers switching to electric vehicles and converting gas furnaces to heat pumps, will also drive up demand for electricity.

Justin Kirkpatrick, an environmental economist and professor at Michigan State University, said solar combined with sufficient battery storage is among the most cost-effective ways to power new data centers. But for that purpose, he said it’s more efficient to build solar and storage in a centralized fashion.

“Is it more efficient to put eight solar panels on 100 houses or put 800 solar panels in the field next to the data center, right by the battery?” Kirkpatrick told SAN.

However, Kirkpatrick does think households can play a role in reducing peak load on the grid through demand response programs. These are utility-run programs where customers can get money back on their electrical bill by voluntarily reducing their electricity consumption during peak demand.

“Every household has a price for reducing their demand,” Kirkpatrick said. “That is an area where households have a role.”

How would energy upgrades be financed?

Big Tech is already making major investments in power generation. Wyent said the tech industry could pay for energy infrastructure that also directly benefits homeowners. Under this model, data center developers would cover about 50% of heat pump costs or 30% of solar and battery installations, with homeowners paying the remainder.

Some utility companies are charging higher rates to large customers such as data centers. As an alternate model, Wyent said the utilities could offer a portion of new revenues toward incentives for household upgrades rather than utility-scale projects.

The report comes as federal tax credits for home energy efficiency and rooftop solar are set to expire at the end of this year, while grid-scale renewable projects retain longer-term incentives.

“We think that one potential source of funding is from hyperscalers and utilities looking for capacity on the grid,” Wyent said.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2150184875_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 17:00:53.887820

Key Takeaways

The U.S. exported 3.9 billion barrels of oil to 146 countries in 2024, representing 55% of its domestic production

The top destinations were: Mexico (11.0%), the Netherlands (9.9%), Canada (8.1%) and China (8.1%)

The U.S. is one of the world’s largest oil producers and exporters. In 2024, the country shipped nearly 4 billion barrels of oil abroad, accounting for more than half of U.S. production that year. This flow of crude, refined products, and other liquids highlights the global importance of American energy.

This visualization breaks down the top countries buying U.S. oil last year. The data for this visualization comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). It tracks all petroleum and liquid fuel exports, measured in barrels.

North America Leads U.S. Oil Imports

Mexico topped the list of importers, receiving 429 million barrels, or 11% of all U.S. oil exports. Canada followed closely, importing over 316 million barrels (8.1%).

Europe and Asia Are Key Markets

The Netherlands was the second-largest buyer, taking in 387 million barrels (9.9%), while other major European buyers included the UK, Spain, and France. These exports often serve as inputs for refining hubs or redistribution across the continent.

Meanwhile, Asian countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, and India also ranked highly—each importing over 150 million barrels.

Broad Global Reach

While the top 10 countries accounted for a majority of exports, U.S. oil reached almost 150 countries. Even smaller nations like Togo, Belize, and Latvia made the list.

Why Does the U.S. Export Oil While Still Importing It?

At first glance, it may seem contradictory for the U.S. to export over half of its oil production while continuing to import oil, especially from Canada. But this is a result of differences in crude oil types, refinery configurations, and global market dynamics.

Most U.S. oil production is light, sweet crude, while many American refineries were built to handle heavier, sour grades. Additionally, some U.S. refineries are located closer to foreign markets than to domestic demand centers. As a result, oil flows both in and out of the country to optimize refining efficiency, logistics, and economic returns.

In total, 55% of U.S. oil production was exported.

With tariffs on steel and aluminum doubled to 50% and extended to 407 additional goods—including wind turbines and railcars—the administration is prioritizing domestic production to insulate the economy from global supply chain shocks U.S. Manufacturing in 2025: Key Shifts, Tariffs, and Reshoring[ 1 ]. This policy framework, reminiscent of historical mobilization efforts like those during World War II, is creating fertile ground for advanced manufacturing sectors. For investors, the intersection of industrial policy, technological innovation, and capital inflows presents compelling opportunities in semiconductors, automation, and clean energy.

Historical Precedents: Lessons from WWII Mobilization

The U.S. industrial mobilization during World War II offers a blueprint for understanding the long-term economic benefits of strategic industrial policy. Government-led construction of war production plants in the 1940s spurred a 30% increase in manufacturing employment and a 10% rise in wages in treated regions, with lasting effects on population growth and median family earnings US economic policy in WW2 shaped regional development | VoxDev[ 2 ]. These plants, often staffed by unskilled workers, not only fueled wartime success but also catalyzed regional development. For example, counties with war production facilities saw a 20% higher population growth and a 7–8% increase in median earnings by the postwar decades US economic policy in WW2 shaped regional development | VoxDev[ 2 ]. This historical precedent underscores how targeted industrial investment can create durable economic value—a lesson echoed in today's CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Modern Policy Tailwinds: CHIPS, IRA, and Reshoring Incentives

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the IRA are reshaping U.S. manufacturing through a combination of tax credits, grants, and regulatory incentives. The CHIPS Act alone has spurred over $30 billion in private-sector investments across 23 projects, projected to create 115,000 jobs and position the U.S. to produce 30% of the world's leading-edge chips by 2032 Two Years Later: Funding from CHIPS and Science Act Creating Quality Jobs, Growing Local Economies[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the IRA has catalyzed a 305% surge in manufacturing investment since 2022, with $89 billion in new projects announced, including $133 billion in clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing How the Inflation Reduction Act sparked a clean energy boom[ 4 ]. These policies are not merely stimulative but transformative, embedding conditions such as workforce development and domestic sourcing to align industrial growth with national security and sustainability goals.

Strategic Sectors: Where to Invest in 2025

Semiconductors and Advanced Materials

The CHIPS Act's $52 billion authorization has drawn commitments from industry giants like

($100 billion) and ($200 billion), creating a domestic semiconductor ecosystem once dominated by foreign producers TRUMP EFFECT: A Running List of New U.S. Investment in President Trump’s Second Term[ 5 ]. However, challenges persist, including the monopolization of leading-edge chip fabrication by firms like TSMC and labor shortages in states like Arizona and New York After the CHIPS Act: The Limits of Reshoring and Next Steps for U.S. Semiconductor Policy[ 6 ]. Investors should focus on firms leveraging AI-driven predictive maintenance and automation to optimize production efficiency, as well as those securing IRA tax credits for green energy integration.

Automation and Industrial AI

Rising labor costs and persistent workforce gaps are accelerating adoption of automation and AI in manufacturing. Rockwell Automation's $2 billion investment in U.S. facilities highlights the sector's potential, with predictive maintenance systems reducing downtime and improving productivity 2025 U.S. Manufacturing: Policy, Automation, Investment[ 7 ]. Small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) are also adopting 3D printing and flexible automation to compete globally, reducing inventory costs and enabling on-demand customization What’s Coming for US Manufacturing in 2025 | NIST[ 8 ].

Clean Energy and Decarbonization

The IRA's $5.8 billion Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program is accelerating the commercialization of low-carbon technologies, particularly in steel and cement production Inflation Reduction Act Two Years Later: Historic Industry Investment[ 9 ]. With the Federal Buy Clean Initiative creating demand for domestic green materials, investors can capitalize on firms integrating renewable energy into manufacturing processes. For example, the IRA has spurred $133 billion in clean energy investments since 2022, with rural communities becoming hubs for EV battery and solar panel production The IRA and CHIPS Act are supercharging U.S. manufacturing[ 10 ].

Challenges and Considerations

While the policy tailwinds are strong, investors must navigate headwinds. Tariff-driven reshoring has led to cross-border tensions and rising production costs, particularly for import-reliant firms U.S. Manufacturing in 2025: Key Shifts, Tariffs, and Reshoring[ 1 ]. Additionally, labor shortages—exemplified by 600,000 open manufacturing jobs in December 2023—require strategic workforce development partnerships The CHIPS Act: How U.S. Microchip Factories Could Reshape the Economy[ 11 ]. Cybersecurity risks for digitized manufacturing systems also demand attention, as SMMs adopt AI and IoT technologies What’s Coming for US Manufacturing in 2025 | NIST[ 12 ].

Conclusion: A New Industrial Era

The confluence of historical precedents and modern policy innovation is redefining U.S. manufacturing. Just as WWII mobilization laid the groundwork for postwar prosperity, today's industrial policies are fostering a resilient, technology-driven industrial base. For investors, the key lies in aligning with sectors that combine policy support, technological adoption, and long-term demand—such as semiconductors, automation, and clean energy. While challenges remain, the strategic opportunities are clear: a reshored, digitized, and decarbonized manufacturing sector poised for decades of growth.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758366353420.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-20 18:00:44.294338

Krishnamoorthi stating that are ""driving up energy bills for Illinoisans"" and asked for more support with clean energy, not less.

""It doesn't make any sense to remove electricity or the supply of electricity from the grid. That is just a dumb policy. We need as much supply as possible to drive down prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

He said that energy demand is rising due to overall usage going up, and also because of data centers being built.

But, he said with Trump's insistence on stopping wind and solar energy projects, supply for that energy is not able to keep up.

And, Illinois families will bear the consequences, possibly seeing their energy bills go up by an average of $180 per year.

He also said this will impact the local economy by causing 20,000 to 30,000 people who work for wind/solar projects to lose their jobs.

""Think about your neighbors who are working on these projects...I can't tell you how many good paying union jobs, for instance, are related to the construction of these projects,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""The loss of those jobs also hurt our local economy. So, in so many ways, he's [Trump] making the affordability crisis worse right now.""

Krishnamoorthi said that by staying in the wind/solar market, it could help the U.S. stay ahead in the global market.

""If we don't do these projects, we seed leadership to the Chinese Communist Party, which is trying to eat our lunch. They are trying to own the entire market for renewables around the world,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""Now, we actually have a fighting chance of defeating them in this competition for renewables around the world because we're starting to develop our own technology. New indigenous supply chains are growing and emerging in the U.S., but they're unfortunately getting knee capped by the Trump administration's approach, which doesn't make any sense in the world.""

Trump has changed and lessened with the which Krishnamoorthi argues doesn't make sense, since fossil fuels also rely on help from the government.

""What I can say is that there are subsidies for fossil fuels that also exist that deprive the federal government of important revenues, because those interests are very powerful. So, let's just be honest about what is the true cost of fossil fuel exploration...if fossil fuel interests or anybody else, is allowed to successfully remove these tax credits, they may profit, but it's going to be at our expense,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

But he wants to be clear his stance is overall more energy on the grid.

""You don't have to be against having a home that's powered by natural gas or driving a car that uses gasoline to also be in favor of wind and solar and other types of energy coming online. If you have more of everything, then we have lower prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

Beyer's tenure on PTEN's board was marked by her influence on energy policy and workforce development, as highlighted by CEO Andy Hendricks in a company statementPatterson-UTI Energy Congratulates Leslie Beyer following her confirmation as Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management[ 1 ]. Her new federal role, which oversees mineral leasing and environmental compliance, positions her to shape policies directly impacting PTEN's operations in oil and gas drilling.

So they’ve been saving up all these plays and they’re going to pull out all the stops they can to beat Texas Tech.
They’re a solid team, and I think they’re going to do some good things this year, but same deal as Texas Tech: Utah has more road experience, but that’s irrelevant in this game as Texas Tech will be coming to Utah.
Collyn: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So obviously, the conversation today was Texas Tech vs Utah.","Transcript

John: Hello and welcome to The Daily Utah Chronicle podcast “The Home Stretch: Sports Edition.” My name is John Leone, sports editor of The Daily Utah Chronicle. I’m here with my assistant editor, Collyn Cowles, and we’re going to be previewing the Utah-Texas Tech matchup. This is probably the biggest home game, if not game in general, Utah’s had in 2+ seasons, and we’re excited to cover it. Collyn, what are your thoughts?

Collyn: Yeah, so Texas Tech is coming to town. They’re ranked 17th in the nation, and Utah is currently ranked 16th in the nation. We got the the honor of getting Big Noon Kickoff. So we’ll get the likes of Urban Meyer and Dave Portnoy and all those other guys being being on campus tomorrow. It’ll be big for the school. The last event that happened like that was College Game Day a few years ago. It should be just the fact this is there for their first conference game of the season. For both teams, it just should just kind of set the standpoint of what either of these two teams are going to do for the rest of the year. If you don’t know anything about those odds, that just pretty much tells you these two teams are the Big 12 powerhouses. Like last season, we didn’t see Arizona State get into that powerhouse spot until like the last few weeks of the season. So the fact that we have the top two teams facing off against each other in week four. It’s pretty cool — on a side note, what’s your approach to this game? It’s like you said, it’s one of the biggest games that the U has had in a few seasons. So what’s your approach on it?

John: This has potential to be the Big 12 Game of the Year, and it’s fortunate that we’re getting it this early, because it comes at a time where there aren’t a ton of marquee games going on this week. I mean, there’s Florida-Miami, which is a good one. There’s Illinois-Indiana, another good one. But none are quite getting the attention of this Utah-Texas Tech game. And I think one reason for that is obviously both teams are 3-0, Utah’s ranked 16th, Texas Tech 17th, and we don’t entirely know how good these teams are. They then went on to play Kent State and beat them 62-14 in a game which they were ahead 48-0 at halftime. And then last week, they played Oregon State in another home game and beat them 45-14 and they were up 28-0 at halftime. So in first times alone, Texas Tech is outscoring their opponents 123-0 in three games, which seems rather unbelievable. And while you consider the strength of schedule and see okay, well, they’ve played Pine Bluff, Kent State and Oregon State … it’s still impressive what they’ve been doing offensively. Pine Bluff and Kent State are 1-2 each, Oregon State’s 0-3. And so this will be the first time we really get to see Texas Tech’s offense operate against some sort of a defense with a pulse, if you will.

Collyn: Yeah, 100% and I think this game is going to test both quarterbacks. All the quarterbacks and seeing who can do more. Obviously, on paper, Texas Tech is known for their defensive line. They have the No. 3 D-line in the country. And for Utah, on paper, our best asset is our O-line. So we, we have the No. 2 best O-line in the country. So this for being week three, and getting the top O-line and the top D-line in the country, being able to go off and showcase affect, like, the college game itself? Like, yes, our fans are going to show up. We are going to be rowdy. We have Sorority Row right outside the stadium. It’s going to be packed. But if this was a 5:00 game instead of a noon game, I think it would be totally different. What do you think on that?

John: Absolutely, I think, I mean, like you said, Utah’s fans will always show up. They have always shown up. And I think there’s something about playing that early in the morning, your fans are never going to be quite as rowdy, quite as loud at 10 a.m. as they would be, say, at 8 p.m., or maybe not even 8 p.m. — 6 p.m. But I still think it’ll be a tough road environment for Tech. Behren Morton obviously struggles on the road. If you take a look at his splits, he does not perform under pressure. I guess his home passing grade is an 80.4, which is great. They’ve played all three games at home this year, and clearly he’s lived up to that with those stats that you mentioned. But his away passing grade takes a huge dip, drops from 80.4 down to 59.0. In an interview with NaQuari Rogers, he was asked kind of about the playbooks, and if they’ve really shown much of what they have buried deep in the books for when they need it most. And obviously he’s on the offensive side of the ball, so he probably can’t speak for the defense as much as the offense, but he said they’ve shown pretty much nothing. So they’ve been saving up all these plays and they’re going to pull out all the stops they can to beat Texas Tech.

Collyn: Yeah, 100% and what I’ve what I’ve been noticing this last week with all of these sports shows that have come out and been talking about this game, that’s all I’ve been seeing. Good college football, game day, Big Noon Kickoff, all the Barstool guys. Everyone is talking about this game. And my concern is, yes, you look on paper and it’s O-line versus D-line. But I don’t like how the media is dissing our defense. I don’t like how the media is dissing our defense. We have a guy, one of our cornerbacks, who’s [got] two interceptions, one of them being a pick six, almost having three interceptions. We have another one of our D-line. John Daly has five sacks on the year for 13 solo sacks. So yes, it’s O-line versus D-line, but I think Morton is going to get pressured a lot, because of just who they’ve played and the amount of physicality we’re going to show him right off this start. It’s not like it’s we’re just going to rely on our old line to get to lead us through, or we’re going to rely on Devon [Dampier]. I think our defense is going to come up huge in this game.

John: Yeah, I totally agree. I think when you take a look at quarterbacks, opposing quarterbacks who make their first start at Rice-Eccles Stadium — not that this is Morton’s first start, but it’ll be his first game playing at Rice-Eccles — when you take a look at those stats, you’ve got guys like Jayden Daniels and Jared Goff and some serious NFL quarterbacks that are making their name in the NFL, who came to Rice-Eccles Stadium as college quarterbacks and totally got rocked. I remember Jared Goff threw five interceptions. Jayden Daniels had … it was below 20 yards of total offensive production, passing and rushing when he played here [for] Arizona State. And Morgan Scalley knows how to dial it up against quarterbacks and make them feel uneasy. To your point, the defense have looked great so far, but it’s kind of the same deal with Texas Tech. We can’t really tell how good Utah is until they play this game. Obviously they had that road win at UCLA which looked amazing at the time, but you’ve seen how UCLA has [taken a] nosedive … they fired their coach, and they’re just spiraling. And then [the Utes] won against Cal Poly — who, FCS opponent, hard to say. And then that Wyoming game, which we’ll get into a little bit, but [there were] some highs and some lows from that game. Wyoming’s no slouch. They’re a solid team, and I think they’re going to do some good things this year, but same deal as Texas Tech: Utah has more road experience, but that’s irrelevant in this game as Texas Tech will be coming to Utah. But the defense has been great. Utah opponents are averaging just over eight points per game, keeping them in the single digits. Like you mentioned, John Henry Daley: five sacks, 13 solo tackles. He’s just wreaking havoc back there. I think Logan Fano is going to be back on his other side at the end, which will be a big addition to this defense … he was out against Cal Poly, and then played limited against Wyoming, but he should be back in full force. I think the main question for Utah is the secondary. You mentioned Jackson Bennee, he’s been great. Couple interceptions. I think the corners on the outside have struggled the most of any unit on defense thus far. Elijah Davis has primarily played as the corner one, and he hasn’t exactly shown a lot to give us confidence ahead of this air raid — not “air raid,” but pass heavy-style offense from Texas Tech.

Collyn: Yeah. They’re 100% going to be throwing the ball to Coy Eakin as much as they can. This kid’s got 11 receptions for 230 yards. So yeah, they’re going to be throwing it to him a lot. What I do like is the way our offense has been running this year, with a lot of RPO, run-heavy. In Wyoming, we saw a lot of pressure on Devon — and that would be my biggest takeaway from this, is just kind of protecting that pocket, protecting him, making sure he’s got enough time. With New Mexico, his O-line was atrocious and he’d only been sacked a handful of times. So I think he’s in good hands in this game, I think the fans are going to back this team and we’re going to come out hot. The only takeaway I saw from Wyoming was the amount of pressure on him. But Wyoming has really good defense. They’re very defensive-heavy, there’s only been one year that people remember them having a good offense, we all know that year … That’d be my biggest thing, just protecting him and making sure he’s got that pocket presence. Because if he’s getting pressured a lot and he has to scramble and he has to dish it out to Wayshawn [Parker], then we can’t afford to lose those 4 or 5 yards every time he gets pressured.

John: Yeah, I agree. I think, like you mentioned, his O-line at New Mexico was abysmal. They had a bottom five pass blocking grade as a unit, and Dampier somehow managed to only get sacked four times on the season, which, in 13 games is insane. He’s been sacked twice this year, which it doesn’t feel like he has at all. I think one of those sacks against Wyoming was … it wasn’t really a sack, it was more just Dampier running around and ended up getting tackled just behind the line of scrimmage. But Dampier is as good as anyone in the country at improvising. And his pocket presence is truly one of a kind. I think Texas Tech is coming into this game thinking “Oh yeah, we’ll be able to get to him, bring him down …” Getting to Dampier is one thing; bringing him down is another. And that dude is shifty. He’s been compared to Kyler Murray and some of those other guys that have really high end, short, short field quickness, where they can just make cuts and adjustments on the fly. Look for that. Dampier is … like you mentioned, his passing game has taken a big step forward. And we’ll keep harping on it: no competition — not no competition, but sparse competition thus far. His 73% completion percentage, seven touchdowns, zero picks, is already such an improvement. Last year at New Mexico, he was barely above 50% completion percentage, and he threw 12 picks and 12 interceptions. So that ratio wasn’t good … I mean, Morton already has 11 touchdowns in one pick, in three games. Dampier had 12 and 12 all last year. But this year, he’s got seven and zero. So you can see that he’s made it a priority to take care of the ball. And one guy that’s helped him with this is Ryan Davis, his former teammate. Davis is a receiver, obviously transferred in with [offensive coordinator Jason] Beck and Dampier from New Mexico. He had 10 receptions versus Wyoming last week, and really has kind of solidified himself as the go-to guy for Dampier in the past game. Jason Beck has spread the wealth across the offense very heavily throughout the first three games. I mean, he’s throwing tight ends out there at Wildcat. Former quarterbacks at Wildcat … you know, you got Nate Johnson, Hunter Andrews, NaQuari Rogers, Wayshawn Parker, all these guys catching snaps, and that doesn’t even include the main guy, Dampier. So, I mean, Jason Beck is getting creative at OC.

Collyn: Yeah. This game is — it’s, to your comment earlier, we’re going to pull all the tricks out of the book this week. Those three games, I’d say you saw a lot of our offense against UCLA, a lot of big plays. But, the Cal Poly, Wyoming games, those were more focusing on getting first downs and getting to our designated spots, kind of perfecting those 5-10 yard plays. But if you look at Texas Tech’s side, I would recommend you take our first three games and their first three games. I mean, we have UCLA, Cal Poly and Wyoming … and compared to Pine Bluff, Oregon State and Kent — I mean, they shouldn’t even have gotten scored on in any three of those games.

John: And they haven’t even played on the road yet.

Collyn: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We’re almost a month into the season. In 10 days, it’ll be their month mark. So yeah, this is going to be a tough matchup for them. I wanted to bring up the amount of money that Texas Tech has spent. They have spent over $25 million on this roster. And a culprit to that was giving a lot of their money to their star transfer from USC, Quinten Joyner, and before the season even started, he had jacked up his knee and he’s out for the year. So, what’s your take on the college football aspect and being able to see a team like Texas Tech spend the most amount of money this year on their roster, but not even be able to get their full resource out of that, with Quinten Joyner being out all year?

John: Yeah. I mean, obviously never, never want to wish an injury on anyone, that sucks for Joyner. He came in, obviously out of USC, [and] was a terrific running back. People were surprised he went to Tech, but, you know, he undoubtedly got a bag to do it. So yeah, he’s out for the year, but another place that Texas Tech spent a ton of their money on is their defensive line, and it looks like that’s paying off for them so far. But to your question about the contracts and teams being able to spend: I’ve seen numbers in the [NIL] ballpark of $25 million to even $55 million, which is just a crazy number to be thrown out there for college football. But you know, Texas Tech’s taking advantage of it, and credit to them for going after it. I know they have a former player … I don’t know his name off the top of my head, but he’s sold two oil companies, and his main goal is to make Texas Tech good again. So obviously, with the new rules into place, they won’t be able to spend this much in the future. But for now, it’s entertaining. We can say that.

Collyn: Yeah, the gentleman you’re talking of is Cody Campbell, yes. So yeah, he’s like some oil guru, and he donated over $55 million to Texas Tech’s NIL fund [sic — see editor’s note] So, yeah, and that’s not just to football. I think fans see that and they think, “Oh, that’s just for football.” No, that’s for the entirety of their athletics program. That’s scholarships across all sports: women’s, soccer, volleyball, hockey, whatever it may be, basketball. And then, you know, majority of it goes to football, majority of it goes to those training facilities and and travel expenses and all the fun stuff that fans really don’t see, right? But I mean, even to Utah’s side, we’ve spent roughly around $15 million, if anyone were wondering. And I don’t know, I like the way our team is looking, without having that headline of where we have a guy giving us $50 million … you know? I would rather the grit, instead of having money talk.

John: Totally. Built, not bought, as they like to say. Yeah, big game here. Collyn, what’s your prediction?

Collyn: Um, honestly, I think we’ll know the way this game is going to go by halftime. I don’t think I’ve seen a lot of pundits talk about this game going to the wire, this game going to the last few seconds. I don’t think it’s going to happen. I think it’s going to be an easy win for Utah. Few touchdowns. It’s going to be a little low-scoring. I have them winning 24-10. I think we’re gonna hold Texas Tech, force the run, show up on the D-line, protect Devon, and we have to convert on field goals. We did not talk about that today, but we have to convert our field goals. If we get an attempt from 30 yards out, we have to convert on these. Every point counts, and I think we’ll know who’s going to win by halftime.

John: I like that. I more or less agree. I think Utah has historically been a second half team. But the way I see it, there are three keys to victory for Utah. I think number one is, believe it or not, establishing a run game. This Texas Tech defensive line has been stout against the run so far, and I think Utah is averaging over 200 rushing yards per game. It’s something crazy. I have the number here: they are averaging 260 rush yards per game, which is crazy, more than Texas Tech, and I’m sure it’s up there in the country, in terms of the highest. Establish the run game; that’ll help you be able to control key number two, which is managing the clock. I think Utah loves to go on those long, extended drives, give their defense a break. They’ve had two drives of 20 plays and 19 plays, just in three games alone. So if they can get some drives like that, go in and just kind of demoralize Texas Tech’s defense, I think that’ll be huge. And manage the clock, keep their offense off the field. And then key number three I had was defense. Defend the pass with pressure and coverage. You’re going to have to have an element of both of those in this game. I think pressure is something that, like I said, Scalley is going to be dialing up, and he’s going to do everything in his power to make Morton uncomfortable. And with Morton kind of putting the ball up for grabs more or less when he’s under pressure, if Utah can come down with a couple interceptions or force a fumble, that’ll be huge, because I think the offenses will look good in this game, if I had to guess. Overall, I think Utah’s able to do these things. It may not look pretty at times, but my prediction is Utah-35, Texas Tech-20. As always, go Utes, and it’s gonna be a fun one. So get there early, get loud. It’s gonna be intense.

Collyn: Yeah, 100%. And to close out this episode, we’ll just kind of give a basic rundown for fans of what to expect for this week, for events happening on campus that students can attend. So obviously, the conversation today was Texas Tech vs Utah. Kickoff is at 10 a.m. on Saturday, tomorrow. Fans can show up for the Big Noon Kickoff at 4 a.m., so the students can start showing up to the public queue area at 4 a.m., fans can enter the set area at 5:30 a.m. There’s going to be food, music prizes and all kinds of different contests that fans can enter themselves into, which also starts at 5:30 a.m. The Barstool show starts at 7 a.m. The annual Ute walk is 7:45 a.m. and then the Big Noon Kickoff show starts at 8 a.m. So if you’re looking to show up, it is recommended to be there early. They’re giving out — first 500 people to get there get shirts, free food, gift cards … all kinds of different stuff they’re giving out to fans. So show up to that early. Be there. Be loud. On another note, for athletics this week, women’s soccer will be traveling down to Texas to face TCU, Texas Christian University, tonight at 6 p.m. TCU is ranked 14th in the nation with a 6-1-0 record. They look very hot. They are very strong. And I think this game is going to determine our women’s soccer program and just kind of put our season in line. It’s the first Big 12 game for the season for the ladies, and the team is led by Kelly Bullock. She has three goals on the year, and she’s just been lights out. So show up! Watch your Utes. Let’s go to these games. The ladies will be back home for the second game of the Big 12 conference against Cincinnati on Sept. 24. And then another sport in fall athletics is women’s volleyball. This week, we are in California and San Luis Obispo. We have a set against Cal Poly today and then one against Vincent St. Mary’s tomorrow. So for athletics this week, just make sure we’re staying aware of our fellow students and showing up for our athletes, and 100% be there for Texas Tech. Show up. Show why the MUSS is the MUSS, and go Utes!

John: Yes, sir, go Utes. This has been our second episode of The Home Stretch this year. Collyn, thank you for coming on. We’re excited to bring you guys more previews, more recaps of football, soccer, volleyball, whatever sports are going on. So, again this is The Home Stretch, presented by The Daily Utah Chronicle. I’m John Leone with my assistant sports editor Collyn Cowles, and we’ll see you next time.

It can now draw down $100 million from Generate Capital, a leading infrastructure investment firm.

John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna, said an initial $12.6 million draw will fund refinancing and construction of active data center projects, with additional capital support for Soluna’s one gigawatt and expanding pipeline.

“We believe this deal with Generate primes Soluna for scale,” Belizaire said. “We’re not just growing our current projects, we’re building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high performance computing.

Belizaire said the deal with Generate reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, one focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution.

“We’ve known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward,” Belizaire said.

Generate was represented by Vinson & Elkins LLP. Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, O’Melveny & Myers LLP, and Lowenstein Sandler LLP represented Soluna.

Project Kati is Soluna’s largest renewable computing site yet. “One hundred and sixty six MW of clean, high-performance computing is on its way to Willacy County,” the company said. “It will deliver 83 MW of clean Bitcoin hosting capacity by early 2026, with Galaxy as the first customer. It will expand to 166 MW in two phases, supporting both Bitcoin hosting and AI/HPC workloads. And it will bring jobs, investment, and long-term economic benefits to Willacy County.”

Soluna is a digital infrastructure company that builds modular data centers that transform curtailed or underutilized renewable energy into compute power for energy-intensive, batchable applications such as Bitcoin mining and AI. By colocating with clean energy producers, Soluna supports a cleaner grid while delivering cost-effective, sustainable infrastructure to enterprises.

Generate has invested over $2.4 billion across sustainable infrastructure credit since inception, making the partnership with Soluna a natural fit. Generate’s institutional experience and capabilities as an asset owner and operator enable it to deliver differentiated value, enabling the partnership to go beyond dollars invested to strategic collaboration.

""Soluna's vision for turning underutilized renewable energy into scalable computing power aligns with our belief in infrastructure that solves real-world challenges,"" said Ryan Miller, principal at Generate Capital. ""We're excited to support their growth through a flexible credit solution and continue our leadership at the nexus of digital and energy infrastructure.”

Belizaire said the new financing package from Generate follows over $30 million in funding raised earlier in 2025 from Galaxy Digital, Spring Lane Capital, and a recent public offering. He said the new agreement adds further momentum to Soluna’s execution roadmap, as the recent addition of 150 MW Projects Gladys and 100 MW Fei pushes the company past one gigawatt of renewable computing capacity.

Belizaire said this milestone builds on the recent 48 MW expansion underway at Project Dorothy 2 and the start of construction of Project Kati 1. He said Soluna intends to expand its computing offerings beyond Bitcoin mining to include AI workloads, reflecting the growing demand for green computing across various industries.

""Soluna's vision for turning underutilized renewable energy into scalable computing power aligns with our belief in infrastructure that solves real-world challenges,"" said Ryan Miller, principal at Generate Capital. ""We're excited to support their growth through a flexible credit solution and continue our leadership at the nexus of digital and energy infrastructure.”

Belizaire said recent expansions of partnerships with Blockware, Compass Mining, Galaxy Digital, and other Hyperscale miners further underscore the company’s growing traction and operational maturity.

Among the highlights of the scalable financing, he said, are:

A credit facility of up to $100 million to be used for refinancing and construction of Soluna’s data center projects.

An initial $12.6 million draw will be used to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2. This unlocks equity capital for Soluna and Spring Lane.

A delayed draw facility of $22.9 million will include continued funding for the Dorothy 2 project and support for the Project Kati 1 data center.

An additional uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility would support Soluna’s growing renewable-powered pipeline and fund AI-related long-lead equipment procurement.

Credit facilities and security are limited to a portfolio of projects financed by Soluna and Spring Lane Capital, are limited recourse, and do not have parent company guarantees.

Generate received warrants for the right to purchase 4 million shares of Soluna common stock anda board observer right.

“The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.
Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.","NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of activists marched down Park Avenue and turned down Billionaires’ Row toward Trump Tower in New York Saturday to “Make Billionaires Pay,” calling for climate justice, democracy, free speech, gender equality, a stop to the Trump’s immigration crackdown and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people’s lives.

“I don’t see them as movements. I don’t see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,” said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone’s headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women’s March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that’s the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her young daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,” it read.

“It’s all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don’t have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we’re not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

From the Gulf Coast to the Pacific Northwest, ports are being reimagined as hubs for offshore wind, hydrogen production, and electrified logistics. This transformation is not merely environmental—it is economic.

For investors, the question is no longer if to act, but how to capitalize on this momentum.

Case Studies in Port Electrification and Energy Innovation

The Port of Long Beach's microgrid deployment project exemplifies the potential of port electrification. By integrating resilient energy infrastructure, the port has reduced fossil fuel dependence while enhancing air quality for surrounding communitiesMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ]. Similarly, the Georgia Ports Authority's adoption of electrified ERTG cranes has set a benchmark for efficiency, demonstrating how ports can adapt to new operational demands without sacrificing throughputMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ]. These projects align with Arup's assertion that ports are becoming “key enablers of the energy transition,” supporting offshore wind deployment and sustainable fuel tradeWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

On the Gulf Coast, ExxonMobil's $21 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and carbon capture network underscore the region's dual focus on traditional and emerging energy systemsClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the Port of Houston's $105 million investment in electric cargo-handling equipment and shore power infrastructure—funded by the EPA's Clean Ports Program—highlights the federal government's role in accelerating decarbonizationClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. Such initiatives are not isolated; they reflect a broader trend of ports leveraging public-private partnerships to reposition underused assets.

Financial Returns and Yield Projections

The economic case for port redevelopment is compelling. A 2025 study by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) notes that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has boosted annual port funding to $450 million, enabling upgrades that accommodate larger vessels and enhance multimodal connectivityUS Port Infrastructure[ 5 ]. These investments directly correlate with improved operational efficiency: the NBER found that expanding port capacity by one ship increases trade by 42% and reduces congestion by 4% at the host portMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ].

Renewable energy integration further amplifies returns. Research from the National Renewable Energy

(NREL) reveals that hybrid renewable systems—combining solar, marine energy, and storage—can cover 60% of a port's energy demand with payback periods under six yearsReturns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. For instance, the Port of Anacortes' $65 million EPA grant for microgrid development, supported by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), illustrates how electrification can unlock new revenue streams through grid services and energy salesMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ].

Challenges and Opportunities

Despite this optimism, challenges persist. Texas' renewable energy pipeline faced setbacks in 2025, with 9 gigawatts of projects canceled due to tariffs on solar panels and policy uncertaintyClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. However, grid reliability has paradoxically improved, with ERCOT reporting reduced summer emergency risks thanks to solar and battery storage deploymentsClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. This duality—volatility in project pipelines versus tangible grid benefits—highlights the need for diversified strategies.

Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states offer a counterpoint. By redeveloping underutilized ports for non-freight activities—such as commercial fishing, recreation, and mixed-use development—ports like Seattle have generated $1.4 billion in economic outputReturns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. The Gulf Coast's $25 billion energy transition investments in 2025, including clean hydrogen and carbon capture, position the region to replicate this successWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

Long-Term Outlook and Investment Strategy

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects renewables will surpass natural gas as the primary electricity source by the mid-2030s, growing from 3.41 quadrillion BTUs (Quads) in 2024 to 14.8 Quads by 2050Returns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. For ports, this means infrastructure tailored to renewable energy—such as offshore wind staging areas and hydrogen export terminals—will become critical. The LSU Center for Energy Studies' 2025 Gulf Coast Energy Outlook reinforces this, noting the region's leadership in lower-emission energy productionWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

Investors should prioritize ports with:

1. Strategic Location: Proximity to offshore wind farms or hydrogen production clusters.

2. Policy Support: Access to federal grants (e.g., EPA's Clean Ports Program) and state incentives.

3. Diversified Revenue Streams: Non-freight activities that buffer against trade volatility.

Conclusion

The redevelopment of underutilized port assets is no longer a niche opportunity—it is a cornerstone of the U.S. energy transition. With Gulf Coast ports leading the charge, investors who act now can secure long-term yields through electrification, renewable integration, and infrastructure modernization.

But instead of expanding or reopening our reliable energy capacity or updating failing long-term plans, the 2019 New Jersey Energy Master Plan, or EMP, is stagnant.
And it will not just be the billion-dollar companies that are affected by New Jersey’s energy policy uncertainty.
Clean energy goals matter, but so do the people and employers trying to stay in New Jersey.
Right now, New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan is an obstacle to both.","New Jersey's Energy Master Plan aims for 100% clean electricity by 2035; however, the commendable goals within this plan may have the unintended consequence of making New Jersey even more unaffordable for the next generation. The impact doesn’t stop at higher utility bills. Facing rising energy costs, unreliable capacity and policy inconsistencies, New Jersey businesses are pulling back — reducing head count and slowing growth resulting in fewer local jobs for the next generation.

At the start of June 2025, New Jersey households experienced an increase in electricity rates of 17–20%, resulting in average monthly bills of approximately $183, which is about 30% above the national average. For an average resident, that’s another $20 to $28 every month, without any corresponding increase in income.

Ask yourself: Do you know anyone whose salary rose 20% this year?

We’re being told to electrify everything — our cars, our homes — but at the same time, we’re facing record-high costs and a grid clearly under strain. And with salaries not keeping pace, those expectations are especially unrealistic for those of us who are just starting out.

For young people trying to live and work in New Jersey, these energy mandates are structural barriers to building a life here in our home state. With student loans, rising rents and wages that don’t keep up, unpredictable energy bills are one more reason my generation often looks to other states for employment.

New Jersey imports around 35% of its electricity, thanks to delayed clean energy projects, such as offshore wind, and the closure of reliable energy plants. Meanwhile, PJM, New Jersey’s regional grid operator, forecasts an additional 39% increase in electricity demand by 2039, driven by the adoption of electric vehicles, home electrification, and the expansion of data infrastructure. My generation is expected to lead this electrification effort, without the infrastructure to support the shift.

The new energy demand levels will require a stable foundation of supply. But instead of expanding or reopening our reliable energy capacity or updating failing long-term plans, the 2019 New Jersey Energy Master Plan, or EMP, is stagnant. The EMP was due for a significant update in 2024, but it has been delayed without a final release date. Meanwhile, rules on emissions, EV sales, building electrification, and energy sources are advancing without formal modeling of their cost. This leaves many of us unsure whether the choices we’re pushed to make today will be even supported or relevant tomorrow.

In June, Amazon announced a $20 billion investment in two data center campuses in Pennsylvania, not New Jersey, despite both being in the same grid region. One site is co-located with a nuclear power plant, offering direct access to steady, affordable baseload power. Pennsylvania paired that with corporate tax reductions and a more transparent energy policy. The result? Thousands of jobs and billions in investment, just across the river. For young professionals, many are seeking to build careers in fast-growing industries such as AI or cloud services, making these lost opportunities increasingly difficult to ignore. As a result, Gen-Z workers will need to look outside of New Jersey to find them.

And it will not just be the billion-dollar companies that are affected by New Jersey’s energy policy uncertainty. Higher utility costs leave less room for hiring, investment, or wage growth for small businesses as well. A local salon, grocery store or restaurant can’t absorb a 20% jump in power costs without raising prices or cutting staff.

Clean energy goals matter, but so do the people and employers trying to stay in New Jersey. The state should pause the implementation of new mandates until the EMP is released and backed by transparent cost models. We need more certainty, not more pressure, especially for those just starting out.

For many of my generation, the decision to stay or leave will hinge on New Jersey’s job market and affordability. Right now, New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan is an obstacle to both.

“I very much want to engage in negotiations on an all-of-the-above permitting reform.
“If we work together on bipartisan permitting reform with the understanding that it includes clean energy, we pass it through Congress, and then the administration does it all except for the clean energy part, then we will look like a bunch of suckers,” Magaziner added.
As discussions continue, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats, also unveiled a possible framework for permitting reform.
HOUSE GOP INVOKES RENEWABLE ENERGY TO WIN DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR PERMITTING REFORM Their recommendations align closely with permitting reform legislation already introduced in the House by streamlining NEPA reviews, restricting judicial review, and prioritizing digitization.","Several Democrats have expressed interest in supporting these proposed reforms, as both sides of the aisle agree that environmental rules have made it too difficult to build in the United States. While Democrats generally do not share Republicans’ ambition of unlocking new fossil fuel production, they do wish to accelerate the permitting process for clean energy and traditional infrastructure projects in their districts. Some have even co-sponsored legislation introduced by their Republican colleagues.

Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) signed on to the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act introduced by House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) at the end of July.

This bill would overhaul and simplify the NEPA, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental effects of major actions and decisions relevant to their departments. It would also limit legal challenges to projects under the existing law.

In an apparent effort to bring more Democrats on board, the bill includes language that is agnostic toward energy sources and infrastructure projects — meaning accelerated reviews would apply to wind, solar, and fossil fuels.

Not all lawmakers, however, are convinced that language is enough to ensure renewables will see the benefits.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI), who has said he wants to reach a “yes” on bipartisan legislation, told the Washington Examiner that he is doubtful the White House would enforce accelerated permitting for renewables, given Trump’s recent crackdown on offshore wind.

“I very much want to engage in negotiations on an all-of-the-above permitting reform. But if the administration is just going to block clean energy projects that have their approvals from going forward, then how could we on our side assume that they are going to be negotiating in good faith?” Magaziner said, referring to the stop-work order issued for the Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is roughly 80% complete.

“If we work together on bipartisan permitting reform with the understanding that it includes clean energy, we pass it through Congress, and then the administration does it all except for the clean energy part, then we will look like a bunch of suckers,” Magaziner added. “And we’re not, we’re not going to go for that. So we’re going to need to see some action from the administration that shows that we’re actually committed to an all-of-the-above energy strategy.”

Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA), who has also co-sponsored legislation focused on modernizing the permitting process, agreed, telling the Washington Examiner that he did not believe they could achieve Democratic consensus without assurance from the White House.

Peters pointed to changes made by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult to permit and approve a renewable energy project, such as requiring Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally sign off on proposals located on federal lands.

He described these obstacles as “anti-business” and said that ideologically driven policy will hurt the U.S.’s ability to secure enough power needed to beat China in the race for artificial intelligence.

While Republicans may have to cede to Democrats’ demands for accelerated permits for renewables, Peters said Democrats will have to do the same for natural gas to secure enough demand and lower energy prices for consumers.

Members on the right side of the aisle appear more optimistic about coming to a bipartisan agreement in the coming weeks and months.

“A lot of Democrats can come to the table, particularly when they understand that at the end of the day, we all actually want the same things,” Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) told the Washington Examiner. “The regulations that have stymied traditional energy production in the United States are the same regulations that are stymying renewable energy production in the United States.”

Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on energy, said a final permitting bill will not necessarily be Republican or Democratic, given the widespread desire to build things faster.

He pointed to the Energy and Commerce Committee’s track record for advancing bipartisan bills, noting that the panel has put out more than any other in the House.

Latta told the Washington Examiner he is working on different pieces of legislation with Democrats right now, looking for bipartisan amendments to ensure they have the votes to advance a bill to the floor.

As discussions continue, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats, also unveiled a possible framework for permitting reform.

“Right now it takes years, even decades, for new green energy and other projects to get connected to the grid and start generating energy to meet demand,” Caucus co-Chairman Tom Suozzi (D-NY) said. “We need commonsense, bipartisan solutions to cut red tape, bring projects online faster, and make energy more affordable for American families. That’s exactly what this framework does.”

Gavin Newsom signed a sweeping package of bills on Friday charting the state's continuing transition to green energy, which includes an extension of the state's landmark cap-and-trade program.

The slate of six bills seeks to address energy affordability, the stabilization of petroleum markets, and reducing air pollution as part of California's acceleration toward a green job-generating economy. A statement from the Governor's Office said California's action comes as the Trump administration continues ""to gut decades-old, bipartisan American clean air protections and derail critical climate progress.""

The bills, which Newsom signed at the Morrison Planetarium at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco on Friday, were approved with bipartisan support in an extended session of the California legislature last weekend. They represent a balancing act in managing the transition from fossil fuels to green energy amid the challenge of climate change, while keeping energy costs manageable for consumers.

""After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California's transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,"" Newsom said in a prepared statement.

Newsom said legislation will bring down electricity costs for Californians by providing up to $60 billion in electricity bill refunds through an expanded California Climate Credit. The legislation also aims to make energy more affordable by accelerating critical clean energy projects and expanding regional energy markets to improve grid reliability.

California has positioned itself as leading the nation on the transition to green energy, but has also faced headwinds from the petroleum industry, the federal government, and the costs associated with the transition. After the state enacted a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, the Trump administration blocked it, prompting a lawsuit by the state. High gas prices and the move by petroleum companies to close refineries in the state have threatened to send prices even higher.

One bill eases regulations on oil production in Kern County in a change the Governor's Office calls ""targeted, locally-led, environmentally responsible"" to boost the state's fuel supply while protecting the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels. The signing of SB 237 brought rare praise from the Western States Petroleum Association, which historically has strongly opposed the state's aggressive climate policies.

""Governor Newsom's leadership on SB 237 was foundational for the renewed partnership with the oil and gas industry,"" the WSPA said in a prepared statement. ""We look forward to continuing our relationship focused on realistic policies that balance environmental and economic goals to ensure California and the Western States have access to the affordable fuels they need.""

Another bill extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045. The program puts a cap on emissions from large polluters that gets lowered over time. Companies can then sell credits for polluting less to other companies, allowing them to reduce emissions while providing flexibility in how the limits are met.

The program is now known as ""cap-and-invest"" to highlight that the money raised is reinvested back into the state to fund projects on climate, housing, and transportation, including the state's high-speed rail project. The state's high-speed rail authority will receive $1 billion annually from the cap-and-invest program in a deal finalized just before the legislature's scheduled adjournment last week.

""Public transportation delivers for the environment and economy by providing Californians with travel options that reduce emissions, relieve congestion, cut household expenses, and sustain middle class jobs,"" said California Transit Association executive director Michael Pimentel in a prepared statement. ""By reauthorizing the Cap-and-Invest program and preserving the state's climate investments in building and operating our public transit systems, these bills will ensure that communities across the state experience the benefits of California's nation leading environmental policies.""

The package also updates California's Wildfire Fund, the $21 billion insurance pool that helps utilities cover wildfire liabilities and avoid bankruptcy. It adds another $18 billion — financed jointly by utility shareholders and ratepayers — while requiring utilities to put in billions more of shareholder money to harden and modernize their equipment.

Some analysts and environmental groups say that Newsom and the state legislature have not yet found the right balance between the state's climate goals and the continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Asha Sharma, state policy manager with the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, told KQED that the legislation doesn't address pollution for Californians who live near refineries.

""We have a real responsibility to ensure that the fourth largest economy in the world, a progressive leader on climate, is really committed to not only climate policies, but ensuring that they're deployed equitably,"" Sharma told KQED.

Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog went further, calling the claims made by the Governor's Office ""a sham.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/19/a18ebee9-9deb-451c-b71b-513949fb8588/thumbnail/1200x630/d9d876b50d0db18f8e7da8398ff791e1/screenshot-2025-09-19-142210.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:14.404285

In this evolving landscape, strategic partnerships and robust risk mitigation frameworks are becoming critical for scaling renewable energy projects. A recent collaboration between Jera Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Energy exemplifies how such alliances can optimize portfolios, enhance grid reliability, and navigate the complexities of transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy.

Strategic Realignment: From Fossil Assets to Renewable Opportunities

On September 15, 2025, Jera Americas completed the transfer of its equity interests in three gas-fired power plants—Tenaska Virginia Generating Station (940 MW), Tenaska Kiamichi Generating Station (1,220 MW), and Tenaska Gateway Generating Station (845 MW)—to Tenaska and Tyr Energy. This $3,005 MW capacity transfer aligns with Jera Americas' broader strategy to divest from carbon-intensive assets and reinvest in renewable energy opportunitiesJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer in U.S. Power Generation Projects[ 1 ]. For Tenaska and Tyr, the acquisition expands their operational footprint in key U.S. power markets (PJM, SPP, ERCOT), where grid reliability remains a pressing concernJERA Americas completes exit from three U.S. power plants as Tenaska and Tyr expand their ownership stakes[ 2 ].

This transaction reflects a broader trend: foreign energy firms are increasingly reallocating capital from aging thermal assets to zero-emission technologies. Jera Americas, for instance, has already begun scaling its renewable portfolio through JERA Nex, its dedicated clean energy subsidiary. In 2024, JERA Nex acquired the 300 MW Oxbow Solar Farm in Louisiana and the 95 MW Happy Solar Farm in Arkansas, both of which supply renewable energy to corporate clients and municipal utilitiesProjects - JERA Nex[ 3 ]. These projects underscore Jera's commitment to diversifying its energy mix while leveraging partnerships to mitigate risks associated with regulatory shifts and market volatility.

Risk Mitigation Through Collaborative Structures

Renewable energy projects inherently face political, economic, and technical risks. However, the Jera-Tenaska-Tyr partnership demonstrates how joint ventures and shared ownership models can mitigate these challenges. By transferring high-quality gas-fired assets to Tenaska and Tyr, Jera Americas reduces its exposure to regulatory penalties tied to carbon emissions while securing stable returns from its renewable investmentsRisk management in renewable energy projects[ 4 ]. Meanwhile, Tenaska and Tyr gain access to dispatchable thermal capacity, which complements their growing renewable portfolios and ensures grid stability during periods of low solar/wind outputJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Complete Joint Share Transfer[ 5 ].

General risk management principles further reinforce this model. For example, political risks—such as policy reversals or permitting delays—are mitigated through diversified ownership structures and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Economic risks, including fluctuating energy prices, are addressed via joint ventures that spread capital costs and revenue streams across partners. Technical risks, such as equipment failures, are managed through performance guarantees and warranties, as seen in JERA Nex's solar projectsJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer[ 6 ].

The Path Forward: Hydrogen, Offshore Wind, and Grid Resilience

Looking ahead, Jera Americas has signaled its intent to pivot toward hydrogen and offshore wind, sectors poised for exponential growth. The company's experience in LNG infrastructure and international energy markets positions it to lead in green hydrogen production and export, particularly in North America's Gulf Coast regionJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer in U.S. Power Generation Projects[ 7 ]. Similarly, Tenaska and Tyr's expanded thermal assets could serve as backup power for intermittent renewables, ensuring a balanced grid as the U.S. transitions to a low-carbon future.

However, success will depend on continued collaboration. For instance, joint ventures between Jera Nex and Tenaska could accelerate offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico, while Tyr's expertise in asset management could streamline solar-battery storage integration. Such partnerships not only reduce individual firm risks but also create economies of scale, driving down costs for investors and consumers alike.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Sustainable Investment

The Jera Americas-Tenaska-Tyr collaboration offers a blueprint for sustainable energy investment in North America. By strategically reallocating capital, leveraging joint ventures, and prioritizing grid resilience, these firms are navigating the dual challenges of decarbonization and energy security. For investors, the lesson is clear: partnerships that balance short-term reliability with long-term sustainability will define the next decade of renewable energy development.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758346210545.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-20 20:02:29.647419

Trump administration’s energy policies are jeopardizing the creation of new jobs in the wind, solar, and other alternative energy sectors, a report by a transition outlet has warned.

According to E2, jobs in energy transition industries grew much faster than jobs in the conventional energy sectors in the past few years, but now the trend is reversing, with the outlet saying that “recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come.”

The report said that last year, new jobs in the transition space came close to 100,000, bringing the total to 3.56 million. However, this was already a slowdown from 2023 despite pro-transition policies pursued by the Biden administration.

E2 blamed the slowdown on “policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth.” Even so, the group said that more than 80% of all new energy jobs last year in the United States were in alternative energy sectors.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, said.

“Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Since President Trump took office, almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled, according to U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy.

As the new administration slashed subsidies and regulatory support for wind and solar, companies involved in these industries have canceled projects worth a total $18.6 billion.

The radical change in federal government attitudes towards the wind and solar industries has already shaken them, causing bankruptcies and stock price slumps.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career?
It is not.’ Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction?
The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance.
When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change.","In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

‘I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework.’

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

our island

up to

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

up

at the world.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21mag-climate-Leaders-04/21mag-climate-Leaders-04-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:25.357118

In the US, the AI boom is spurring the biggest surge in power demand in decades, leading to soaring utility bills.
Without parallel investment in renewables, higher demand could push baseload power prices up 9% by 2040.
“That’s why we continue to invest in London and other major metro areas even when power prices are high.” Countries like France where power prices are cheaper are more attractive than Britain and that will start to take effect by 2030, according to ICIS.
“High UK electricity costs are likely to remain a structural drag, as data-center developers increasingly gravitate toward regions with lower power prices and abundant renewable resources.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are among the US firms that have in recent days pledged to invest £31 billion ($41.8 billion) into artificial intelligence projects in Britain, but industry experts say the commitment could be undermined by the UK’s aging power grid and some of the world’s highest electricity prices.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised to fast-track planning approval for data centers and ease access to the power grid. But AI is notoriously energy-hungry and companies could look elsewhere if the government can’t meet its commitments.

“The UK is simply unfit for datacenter development, with some of the world’s highest electricity prices, an ill-suited planning system and a systemic failure of governance,” said Joshua Leahy, chief technology officer at XTX Markets.

Earlier this year, XTX Markets, the quant trading firm backed by billionaire Alex Gerko, announced it would spend more than €1 billion building five data centers in Finland, where power is cheaper, to underpin its growing use of machine learning.

The US-UK initiative is a spin off from President Donald Trump’s visit to the UK this week.

Getting these plans off the page and onto the ground is going to be tough. New infrastructure in the UK from hospitals to manufacturing is already facing challenges from an aging, strained grid. As things stand, it can take at least five years to get a new connection, according to Savills Plc, a real estate firm working with developers to identify which sites are suitable for data centers.

In the US, the AI boom is spurring the biggest surge in power demand in decades, leading to soaring utility bills. The largest grid, stretching from Virginia to Illinois and home to the biggest concentration of AI data centers in the world, mostly uses natural gas, nuclear reactors and coal rather than clean energy.

In the UK, the same power mix isn’t going to work. The government’s central energy policy envisages having a clean grid by 2030 while lowering bills by £300. On top of that, if the planned “AI growth zones” come to fruition, they would create a huge surge in electricity demand.

Looking at the US experience, it’s increasingly difficult to see how Britain can manage to achieve all of these things.

The UK is making progress toward its 2030 goal, getting a record 50% of its electricity supply from renewables last year, according to government data. Even with renewable power being added at a record pace, demand from data centers could grow 40% by 2030 which would quickly soak up the extra supplies, according to analysis firm ICIS.

The UK has high electricity costs because of the role gas-fired power plants play in setting prices. The most expensive megawatt needed to meet demand sets the price for everyone in the market. That means that even if the wind is blowing and the sun shining, a small amount of expensive gas on the grid can drive up the cost. In other parts of Europe, like France, cheaper sources like nuclear energy keeps prices lower.

To be sure, the tech industry is often willing to pay up for power. People in the power sector talk about the AI premium - referring to the higher cost the industry is willing to absorb to get the supply they need. Last year, Microsoft to agreed to steep prices to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in New York.

But the extra demand could push up prices for everyone, a politically fraught prospect in a country where utility bills are front of mind for inflation-scarred voters.

A large-scale 100-megawatt facility can use as much electricity as 260,000 homes, according to Aurora Energy Research Ltd. Without parallel investment in renewables, higher demand could push baseload power prices up 9% by 2040.

“Our overriding priority is being where our customers are, with the strongest connectivity and lowest latency,” said Seamus Dunne, managing director for UK and Ireland at Digital Realty. The firm operates one of the biggest fleets in London with 13 data centers. “That’s why we continue to invest in London and other major metro areas even when power prices are high.”

Countries like France where power prices are cheaper are more attractive than Britain and that will start to take effect by 2030, according to ICIS.

“The price differential is currently the main distinction between the French and UK markets in terms of data-center attractiveness,” said Luca Urbanucci, analyst at ICIS. “High UK electricity costs are likely to remain a structural drag, as data-center developers increasingly gravitate toward regions with lower power prices and abundant renewable resources.”

(RIVN) has taken a bold step forward with the groundbreaking of its $5 billion Georgia factory, a project that could redefine its trajectory in the mass-market EV landscape. This analysis evaluates Rivian's strategic momentum through the lens of supply chain resilience and production scalability, drawing on recent developments and partnerships to assess its long-term viability.

Supply Chain Resilience: Localization and Strategic Partnerships

Rivian's Georgia factory is not merely a production hub but a cornerstone of its strategy to insulate itself from global supply chain vulnerabilities. The company has secured a $6.6 billion federal loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and a $1.5 billion state incentive package from Georgia, contingent on creating 7,500 direct jobs and 8,000 indirect jobs by 2030 Rivian breaks ground on $5B Georgia factory ahead of construction in 2026[ 1 ]. These incentives are tied to Rivian's commitment to localize its supply chain, a critical move in an era of rising tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty.

A key component of this strategy is Rivian's partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to produce 4695 cylindrical battery cells at a new Arizona facility. These cells, set to power the R2 and R3 models, offer six times the capacity of the 2170 cells currently in use, enhancing energy density and safety 2026 Rivian R2 Will Get New LG Cells With 'Six …[ 2 ]. This collaboration aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) requirements for domestic battery production, reducing Rivian's reliance on overseas suppliers while qualifying for federal tax credits Rivian R2 will get Arizona-made batteries from LG[ 3 ].

Moreover,

has proactively stockpiled lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells from Gotion High-Tech in China and Samsung SDI in South Korea, ensuring short-term stability amid tariff risks Rivian’s Strategic Battery Stockpile: A Smart Move Against Tariff Challenges[ 4 ]. This dual approach—short-term stockpiling and long-term localization—demonstrates a nuanced understanding of supply chain dynamics. By co-locating suppliers near its Georgia plant, Rivian aims to reduce logistics costs and lead times, a strategy echoed by traditional automakers like and in their Southeastern U.S. operations Rivian Georgia Plant: EV Supply Chain Investment Opportunity[ 5 ].

Production Scalability: From Ambition to Execution

The Georgia factory's two-phase design, targeting 400,000 annual vehicles by 2028, represents a quantum leap for Rivian. Currently, the company produces 15,000 units annually at its Illinois plant, a scale insufficient to compete with Tesla's 4 million vehicles or Ford's 2.5 million It's 'Do or Die' for Electric Vehicle Maker Rivian as It Breaks Ground on a $5 Billion Plant[ 6 ]. The Georgia facility's phased approach—200,000 units per phase—allows for incremental capacity expansion while mitigating financial risk.

This scalability is further bolstered by Rivian's investment in workforce development. The company has partnered with Georgia's technical colleges and universities to create apprenticeship programs, ensuring a pipeline of skilled labor for advanced manufacturing Rivian | Georgia Department of Economic Development[ 7 ]. Such initiatives not only address immediate labor needs but also strengthen the regional ecosystem, a factor that could attract additional suppliers and investors.

However, scalability hinges on Rivian's ability to execute its timeline. Delays in construction or production could exacerbate cash flow pressures, particularly as the company burns through $1 billion annually in operating costs Rivian Breaks Ground on $5B EV Plant in Georgia[ 8 ]. The Georgia plant's proximity to I-20 and major ports, however, provides a logistical edge, enabling efficient distribution to the Eastern U.S. and export markets Rivian Holds Kickoff Ceremony for Georgia Plant, Accelerating American Manufacturing Growth[ 9 ].

Challenges and Mitigants: Navigating a Competitive Landscape

Rivian's path is not without obstacles. The U.S. EV market is maturing, with slowing sales growth and the expiration of federal tax credits At a truly awful time to build an electric vehicle[ 10 ]. Competitors like

and Ford are also scaling production, with Tesla's Texas and Berlin Gigafactories targeting 500,000 units annually by 2025. Rivian's differentiation lies in its focus on premium utility vehicles (R1T/R1S) and its upcoming R2 and R3 models, which aim to capture the mass market with lower price points Rivian breaks ground on $5 billion Georgia electric vehicle plant[ 11 ].

Environmental concerns from local residents—particularly regarding the Georgia plant's impact on farmland—could also delay permits or spark regulatory scrutiny Rivian Breaks Ground on $5B EV Factory in Georgia, Boosting Jobs and Production[ 12 ]. Rivian's emphasis on sustainability, including renewable energy integration and modern construction techniques, will be critical in addressing these concerns and maintaining its ESG credentials Tracking Success] Rivian’s Supply Chain – How a Startup Competes in the EV Market[ 13 ].

Investment Outlook: Balancing Risks and Rewards

For investors, Rivian's Georgia factory represents both a high-stakes gamble and a potential catalyst for long-term value creation. The project's success depends on three pillars:

1. Supply Chain Localization: Continued progress with LGES and domestic battery producers will reduce exposure to global disruptions.

2. Production Timelines: Meeting 2028 production targets is essential to achieving economies of scale and profitability.

3. Market Differentiation: The R2 and R3 models must resonate with price-sensitive consumers in a crowded EV segment.

While risks remain, Rivian's strategic alignment with the IRA, its vertically integrated approach, and its geographic advantages position it to capture a meaningful share of the EV market.

When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change.
What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change?
About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not.
Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change?","Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

‘We are going to change our whole society.’

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

our island

up to

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

up

at the world.

In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21mag-climate-Leaders-07/21mag-climate-Leaders-07-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 13:02:44.007066

The latest manufacturing investment follows ABB’s $170 million commitment to its U.S. facilities two years ago.
The $110 million new investment will help create a new production line in Mississippi for ABB’s Emax3 circuit breakers.
Earlier this year, ABB announced $120 million investment for new manufacturing sites in Selmer, Tennessee and Senatobia, Mississippi.
“Technology wins,” said Brian Nelson, renewable segment leader at Swiss-based energy technology giant ABB.","Swiss-based global energy technology firm ABB Inc. is upping its greatly expanded investment in U.S. manufacturing by another $110 million this year to strengthen research and development around advanced electrification for the commercial and industrial sectors.

The latest manufacturing investment follows ABB’s $170 million commitment to its U.S. facilities two years ago. Those include projects around motor drives in Wisconsin and manufacturing, robotics and other services in New Mexico, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

This month’s investment expansion could create nearly 200 new jobs in products serving growth industries such as data centers and the power grid. The International Energy Agency and other forecasters such as Goldman Sachs are forecasting a tremendous demand growth due to artificial intelligence and cloud-based computing, as well as industrial and transportation electrification.

The $110 million new investment will help create a new production line in Mississippi for ABB’s Emax3 circuit breakers. The capital will also be spent to double the footprint of ABB’s power quality and protection equipment manufacturing in Richmond, Virginia, which is opening later this year.

“This $110 million investment in the US is part of our long-term strategy to support future growth in our biggest global market,” said Morten Wierod, ABB CEO, in a statement. “Demand is being driven by key trends, from the surging power needs of AI in data centers, to grid modernization and customers improving energy efficiency and uptime to reduce their costs. Our investments will ensure we can meet growing demand from customers across North America in line with our local-for-local strategy.”

ABB will invest $30 million of its capital to expand three new production lines in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, where the company manufactures smart circuit breakers and switching devices. That expansion will bring 90 new skilled labor jobs by the end of 2026, according to the company.

ABB also is increasing capacity for advanced low- and medium-voltage grid components at its plant in Pinetops, North Carolina, which is going to open next year also.

Earlier this year, ABB announced $120 million investment for new manufacturing sites in Selmer, Tennessee and Senatobia, Mississippi. These are both plants to produce electrical distribution and circuit breakers to market beginning in 2026.

“Demand is increasing steadily for advanced electrification technologies, driven by growth in key sectors including data centers and utilities,” Wierod at the time of the March 2025 announcement. “Our new facilities in Selmer and Senatobia will keep our U.S. customers at the cutting edge of the energy transition and help them meet their performance, productivity and energy efficiency goals.”

Including the past three years, ABB has committed more than $500 million of new investment in its U.S. manufacturing operations. U.S. revenues for the company total nearly $9 billion annually, while the workforce is close to 17,000 people across those facilities.

At last week's RE+ energy conference--where more than 40,000 industry insiders gathered in Las Vegas to talk about the energy transition, enthusiasm and optimism were high for electrification and decarbonization despite recent political headwinds against renewables.

“Technology wins,” said Brian Nelson, renewable segment leader at Swiss-based energy technology giant ABB. “Technology will continue to push the evolution of renewable energy further and further.”

On a purely company level, Nelson highlighted the rise of new 2,000-volt capacity for solar energy collection, pushing module capabilities higher and energy denser than ever.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/09/68ced142de78c994b6d34145-abb_manufacturing_photo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-20 13:02:52.497396

After cutting the US wind and solar industries off at the knees all year long, the Trump administration has finally woken up to the fact that wind and solar are the only abundant, accessible domestic energy resources that can meet the nation’s surging demand for electricity ASAP, STAT, on the double, economically, safely, and at scale, too. At least, that’s what one may think upon a cursory reading of the Energy Department’s new “Speed to Power” plan. It is tailor made to vault renewable energy back to priority status in federal energy policy — or not, as the case may be.

More Renewable Energy, Pleeeeese!

Actually, “Speed to Power” is more of a plea than a plan. In a September 18 announcement, the Energy Department let everybody know that it has issued a formal Request for Information, desperately seeking any and all ideas from the private sector on how to “accelerate the speed of large-scale grid infrastructure project development for both transmission and generation.”

The Energy Department sure sounds anxious enough to try anything. In the announcement, the agency admitted that “the current rate of project development is inadequate to support the country’s rapidly expanding manufacturing needs and the reindustrialization of the U.S. economy.”

“The Speed to Power initiative will help ensure the United States has the power needed to win the global artificial intelligence (AI) race while continuing to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable and secure energy,” the Energy Department added, which is a sideways way of indicating that US President Donald Trump’s new fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” plan has already fallen on its face.

In fact, the pitch for Speed to Power slots neatly into the renewable energy picture. The US wind and solar industries (especially solar) have spent the better part of the early 2000’s demonstrating that they can deliver kilowatts on the megascale faster, and more economically, than any other energy resource on the market today.

Restarting the Renewable Energy Engine, Or Not

The US renewable energy track record is even more impressive considering that the nation’s rich offshore wind resources have barely been tapped as yet, having hit the doldrums all through the Obama administration and the first Trump administration, too.

Former President Joe Biden finally wrangled the offshore industry into speed mode with a near-term goal of 30 gigawatts. By the time US President Donald Trump took office, a long list of Biden-era offshore wind projects was already through the review stage and on the way to construction. In fact, some were deep into construction when Trump pulled the plug.

If the Energy Department is really that desperate to make Speed to Power happen, perhaps Energy Secretary Wright could find a tactful way to suggest that US President Donald Trump’s fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” needs a bit of a tweak, particularly in regards to the US offshore wind industry.

For example, one need look no farther than the Revolution Wind project, a 704-megawatt offshore wind farm located off the coast of Rhode Island. The work was 80% complete as of last August, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered the work to stop.

That’s peanuts compared to the 2.4-gigawatt SouthCoast Wind project in Massachusetts, which was greenlighted for construction until Burgum pulled the plug last Friday.

And, that’s the problem. Instead of collaborating with other federal agencies on significant domestic energy initiatives, the Energy Department is only seeking projects within its funding wheelhouse. The Speed to Power RFI covers “near-term investment opportunities, project readiness, load growth expectations, and infrastructure constraints that DOE can address,” the Energy Department explains (emphasis added).

The Energy Department’s authority over US energy policy is rooted in the nuclear industry of World War II, so it’s no surprise to see a focus on nuclear power in the RFI. Besides, even if Energy Secretary Wright wanted to address constraints on the offshore wind industry, first he would have to ask Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to restart the federal offshore lease program upon which the entire offshore industry depends, and stop issuing stop-work orders on projects already in the pipeline. Wright will also have to tell Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to stop re-reviewing offshore wind permits that were already reviewed and approved.

In addition, Wright will have to get Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to reverse his reversal of a federal grant program aimed at upgrading 12 seaports around the nation to serve as offshore wind industry hubs, and he will have to convince US Attorney General Pam Bondi to reverse her reversal of prior offshore wind approvals, too.

Renewable Energy And The Reliability Canard

If you’re thinking that Speed to Power will fall just as flat as American Energy Dominance, drop a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, in an exquisite coincidence of timing, the Energy Department issued its plea for more power generation just three days before renewable energy advocates from all over the world descend upon the US for New York Climate Week 2025.

CleanTechnica will be in and around New York all week, and we’re particularly interested to know what representatives from the global wind and solar industries make of Speed to Power, particularly in regards to another stipulation coughed up by the Energy Department in the new initiative.

In addition to seeking input on projects only within the Energy Department’s funding authority, Speed to Power relies on the same outdated “reliability” canard that shuts the door on wind and solar. In the September 18 announcement, Secretary Wright emphasized that the hunt is on for any and all “affordable, reliable and secure sources.”

“With the Speed to Power initiative, we’re leveraging the expertise of the private sector to harness all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race,” he repeated.

In case anyone didn’t get the message, the Energy Department cited its lopsided new grid report, in which it warned that that “blackouts could increase by 100 times by 2030 if the U.S. continues to shutter reliable power sources and fails to add additional firm capacity.”

Sure, Let’s Save All Those Coal Jobs

So, where does that leave the Energy Department? With not much, that’s for sure. The agency has fallen back on expensive, wasteful emergency measures such as pulling the mothballed Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan out of mothballs.

The Energy Department has also pulled the emergency cord to force a lumbering, antiquated coal power plant in Michigan to remain open past its scheduled retirement date. That’s not a plan, that’s a sop to the US coal industry, which is still clinging to the hope that Trump will finally make good on his promise to save coal jobs.

“Coal prices are far less volatile than those of natural gas,” the coal industry organization America’s Power notes weakly, but that won’t help. Natural gas has been pushing coal out of the US power generation picture since the early 2000’s, and it will continue pushing with or without an assist from renewable energy resources.

Last week, for example, the Ohio-based power engineering firm Babcock & Wilcox joined with the investment fund Denham Capital to announce a new partnership aimed at leveraging existing transmission infrastructure in the US and Europe to convert coal power plants to gas. “Through the partnership, substantial investments will be made to convert coal-fired power plants to cleaner natural gas solutions, which represent a crucial bridge for the clean energy transition,” the partners explained.

In terms of the renewable energy transition, that “bridge” pitch is worth debunking, but the point is that coal’s place in the power generation profile is shrinking no matter what lifeline the Trump administration tosses into the seas.

Renewable Energy Gets The Last Laugh, Eventually

Oh the irony, it burns. Trump’s own insistence on a Federal Reserve rate cut could give renewable energy investing the edge over coal and gas, too, according to some analyses. For that matter, Trump’s carefully articulated American Energy Dominance plan contains the seeds of coal’s destruction. In addition to throwing a protective blanket over the US nuclear industry, the plan includes multiple renewable energy resources, including hydropower, geothermal, and biomass along with marine energy.

All of these renewable resources face cost and timeline obstacles under the current state of technology, but none of them are going away. Neither is the wind or the sunshine, for that matter. They will all be sticking around long after Trump leaves office on January 20, 2029, as scheduled — peacefully, one hopes, this time.

That was the message from executives, investors and industry leaders at BloombergNEF’s Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI Summit in Houston on Thursday.

The meeting took place against the backdrop of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which preserved incentives for some sectors while clawing them back for others. Meanwhile, the nation’s shakeup of clean energy policy has prompted some companies to look for opportunity elsewhere, and the AI boom is forcing grids to expand.

Here are five takeaways from the summit about the state of the energy transition in the age of Trump and AI.

Companies look outside of US for opportunities

With Trump rolling back clean-tech incentives, some companies are refocusing their efforts abroad. That’s particularly the case for the battered green hydrogen industry, which has seen high costs, falling investment and stalled projects. In the US, gas is “relatively inexpensive,” and selling green hydrogen into Europe makes more sense, according to Gavin Rennick, president of new energy for SLB.

It’s also the case for carbon capture and storage. In a separate panel, Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s Anthony Cottone said the company is positioning its carbon removal product toward mandated carbon markets. Cottone is the president and general manager of the oil and gas major’s carbon removal unit, 1PointFive, which is currently commissioning a direct air capture plant in Texas.

While the US doesn’t have a federally-regulated carbon market, the European Union and other geographies have emissions trading schemes in place that make carbon credits for direct air capture more enticing.

Regulation is needed to scale green tech

For many green technologies, scaling the Valley of Death and commercializing successfully requires a bit of policy support. And not just carrots, but also sticks.

“We need to transition this not from a voluntary market but to a global regulatory market where there’s actually mandates,” Cottone said of the carbon market. In his view, that’s necessary to lower the technology cost curve and guarantee long-term customer demand for products like carbon dioxide removal credits.

That sentiment was echoed by infrastructure investor Chris Rozell, who co-founded Cresta Fund Management. “I don’t see any case today where you can make alternative fuels at a price that’s lower than crude,” but subsidies could make them “digestible for economies.”

Grid must double in size in 15 years

The US grid took more than 100 years to build out and now has to double in size to meet demand. And it has to do it in the next 15 years, according to industry executives.

Connecting the three power main grids is one of the “most cost effective things to do,” said Michael Skelly, co-founder and CEO of transmission developer Grid United. A national policy to develop high voltage power lines would facilitate that, he said.

Frank Kreikebaum, engineering chief for Smart Wires, said his company was able to help data centers connect in half the time of alternate solutions with the aid of hardware to better manage flow across power lines, substations and other equipment.

The data center build-out is costly

The bitter battle brewing over how to accelerate the AI data-center build-out without unduly burdening consumers was a key point of discussion, with NRG Energy Inc. CEO Larry Coben asking “Who pays for this expansion?”

Coben also noted that this new wave of infrastructure-building isn’t creating the jobs generated by past build-outs. “Data centers are extremely important, both business wise and to national security, but the long term job creation generally isn’t there,” he said.

Terawatt Infrastructure CEO Neha Palmer, meanwhile, emphasized the need for new power generation as electric vehicles proliferate. Like data centers, EVs need power “as fast as possible but the cost is also incredibly important” especially for heavy duty truck fleets that are comparing the cost per mile versus diesel, she said.

Redwood Materials Inc. Chief Executive Officer JB Straubel said batteries have a role to play in stabilizing the load for data centers, which see oscillating rather than steady power demand.

Biofuels may help US farmers

As US farmers struggle with low commodity prices and a trade war that’s hitting demand, biofuels are becoming a key market for the industry.

“I wouldn’t say it’s the answer, but it’s certainly a big part of the answer,” Donnell Rehagen, chief executive of Clean Fuels Alliance America, said.

Rehagen pointed to recent US proposals on biofuel blending mandates, saying he thinks the Trump administration has come to the same conclusion and “is looking at renewable fuel policy as a way to try to help agriculture get through a time like this.”

Fellow panelist Fernando Candia, Bunge’s vice president of global carbon solutions, said biofuel mandates “have enormous importance” for the industry and farmers, who are looking for the visibility and incentives they provide.",https://energynow.com/wp-content/uploads/Houston-Downtown-Skyline-1200x810-1.png,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:44.779195

The award, which recognizes significant contributions to reducing the environmental impact of film productions, was presented to del Toro by Sam Read, executive director of the Sustainable Entertainment Alliance.

Among its green achievements while filming in Toronto, Frankenstein used electric vehicles (EVs) on the production which were quickly recharged through temporary DC fast-charging stations provided by Netflix. The use of diesel generators was cut by more than a third, with Ontario’s clean electricity grid used instead through careful redistribution of available power. These measures, combined with hybrid vehicles, allowed the production to avoid over 50,000 liters of fuel. Additionally, while filming in the U.K., Frankenstein became the first Netflix production to use a mobile hydrogen power unit.

Read highlighted the impact of these efforts in his remarks: “We know from our industry research that the majority of a film’s carbon emissions come from fuel usage, so we’re honored to recognize Frankenstein and Guillermo del Toro’s legacy of sustainability, whether that is how you make the films, but also the films that you make which explore the balance between humanity and the natural world we live in.”

The production also made substantial strides in reducing waste, including minimizing single-use plastics and recycling 180 metric tons of steel from its sets. These initiatives reflected a holistic commitment to sustainability, from energy use to material recycling.

“Shout out to Miles Dale who is always insisting on this,” said del Toro, crediting his long-time collaborator, producer J. Miles Dale, for driving the sustainability efforts on Frankenstein. He added, “Miles Dale and I have been partners for more than a decade, and his dedication to these practices has always been inspiring.”

Dale noted, “We have 53 EV and hybrid vehicles on the show. With our fast chargers here, we can charge a car in about 20 minutes.” He continued, “I think increasingly we will have electric vehicles. That movement is coming. I think that we as producers are committed to doing that going forward.”

Running a sustainable production does not require giving up full creative control, notes del Toro, “We have to decide which one is the thing that we can do more reasonably when we want full control and also not damaging a natural resource. It is a people-driven industry. So you have an impact on the community immediately.”

The company, which owns Facebook, filed an application with US regulators this week seeking authorization to do so. A Meta representative said it was a natural next step to participate in energy markets as it looks to power operations with clean energy.

Buying electricity has become an increasingly urgent challenge for technology companies including Meta, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. They’re all racing to develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems and tools that are notoriously resource-intensive. Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft are already active power traders, according to filings with US regulators.

While big tech companies consume huge amounts of electricity, they also have contracts for power that they can flip around and sell when prices are high.

“There will be opportunities to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and make a little extra money doing that,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James.

Plus, tech companies that have batteries or on-site generators at data centers can sell power from those back to the grid when prices spike, said Andy DeVries, a utilities and power analyst at CreditSights Inc.

Power demand from data centers used to build and run AI models is set to quadruple in 10 years, based on projections from BloombergNEF. At the same time, power prices are rising amid this surge in electric demand. In fact, capacity payments — which generators get in some US markets — hit a record in an auction held this year by the country’s biggest grid, which stretches from Washington to Chicago.

The demand is so robust that some tech firms that touted their climate goals are now considering natural gas a key source to help power their data centers. Last month, for instance, Louisiana regulators approved utility Entergy Corp.’s plan to build three natural gas plants to power Meta’s data center there.

Meta’s application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks authorization “to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It didn’t identify, however, where in the US it would seek to trade power. The company would be required to file for membership in order to trade in one of seven competitive power markets, such as the Texas grid or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which encompasses the Louisiana data center.

It filed the request through a subsidiary, Atem Energy LLC, formed to act as a power marketer. Meta asked for its application to be approved by Nov. 16.

In recent years, Nevada has built some of the largest clean energy projects in the country, with seven solar projects boasting more than 200 megawatts of capacity. Between now and 2030, another six are expected to come online.

Nevada's solar-plus-storage portfolio now includes several massive projects, including the Gemini Solar Hybrid facility. Completed in March 2024 with 690 megawatts of solar capacity and 380 megawatts of battery storage, it stands as one of the world's biggest solar-plus-storage plants. Not too far away, the Reid Gardner storage project adds another 220 megawatts of capacity.

According to Cleanview's project tracker, Nevada now hosts 66 utility-scale solar farms with a combined capacity of 5,285 megawatts. These megaprojects have helped Nevada become one of the largest solar markets in the U.S. — roughly 30% of the state's power capacity comes from utility-scale solar, more than any other state.

Chart Source: Cleanview's market intelligence platform

Why is solar and storage growing so quickly in Nevada?

The state has ideal conditions for solar deployment: abundant sunshine, and — critically — vast available federal land near major load centers like Las Vegas and Reno.

This geographic advantage has enabled large solar farms with co-located batteries that achieve significant economies of scale. (It also creates significant risk going forward given the Trump administration's recent policy changes favoring older energy industries.)

Nevada's transformation from coal state to solar and storage leader has also been driven by some of the smartest, most supportive clean energy policies in the country.

In 2019, Nevada's legislature increased the state's renewable portfolio standard (RPS), jumping from 25% to 50% by 2030, with a goal to be 100% carbon-neutral by 2050. The utility NV Energy responded immediately with an ambitious plan to add 1,200 MW of solar and 590 MW of battery storage by 2023.

The law also included provisions discouraging fossil fuels, prohibiting new coal, and limiting gas expansion. This effectively nudged the utility to use batteries for reliability instead of the gas peakers that utilities have traditionally relied on.

Another key driver is Nevada's opportunity to export power to California. Developers can store surplus solar generation and export it across state lines during evening hours when California prices are high.

As part of the Western Energy Imbalance Market, Nevada has seen multiple days where evening power prices in California spiked above $1,000 megawatts an hour — creating lucrative opportunities for battery discharge.

Lessons learned from the Silver State's Solar Boom

Nevada generated just under 30% of its electricity from utility-scale solar in 2024—three times the U.S. average. No state has a higher solar penetration rate, not even California.

Chart Source: Cleanview's market intelligence platform

And its success scaling solar and storage provides reasons for optimism. Nevada's emergence as a battery storage leader follows a familiar pattern in America's energy transition. In the early 2010s, Iowa and Texas pioneered utility-scale wind development thanks to exceptional resources and supportive policies. A few years later, California and North Carolina led the country's initial solar boom.

Today, Nevada is playing that same pioneering role for battery storage. Its combination of high solar penetration, perfect geography, and smart policy frameworks has made it an early adopter of a technology that will soon become ubiquitous.

Nevada won't be the last storage success story. Just as wind spread from Iowa and Texas to Oklahoma and Kansas, and solar expanded beyond California to states like Arizona and Florida, battery storage will likely proliferate across the country. Nevada is simply an early adopter of a technology that is quickly becoming essential to America's clean energy future.

Behind climate discourse lies a struggle for energy hegemony and the promise of a new industry that can become a lever of sovereignty or an extractive mirage.

Green hydrogen has ceased to be a laboratory concept and has become the centerpiece of the global energy transition. The International Renewable Energy Agency projects more than USD 240 billion in investments by 2030 and estimates that demand could reach 100 million tons per year by the same horizon. The figures are staggering and the competition is already underway.

The United States subsidizes each kilo with up to USD 3 through the Inflation Reduction Act. Germany pays up to USD 5.5 through the H2Global program. China controls 40% of the worlds electrolysis capacity and is launching massive projects in Inner Mongolia. Saudi Arabia is developing NEOM, an USD 8.4 billion complex set to produce 600 tons per day of green hydrogen in 2026. Latin America is trying to ride this wave with Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina deploying their own strategies.

The energy map is being reconfigured in real time. What is at stake is not only how to replace fossil fuels, but who will control the value chains, who will emerge as an exporter of clean energy, and who will be reduced to a supplier of raw materials. The green hydrogen race is climatic, technological, and geopolitical. The next five years will decide whether the planet moves toward a just transition or toward a global mirage painted green.

Europe and its climate obsession

Europe has decided that green hydrogen will be the heart of its climate and energy security strategy. The European Commission has set a goal of producing 10 million tons per year of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and importing another 10 million from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Brussels understands that it is not enough to electrify easy sectors such as urban mobility. The challenge is to decarbonize steel, cement, fertilizers, and maritime and air transport. For that, green hydrogen appears as the indispensable tool.

The European plan rests on massive subsidies. Germany leads with the H2Global program that offers up to USD 5.5 per kilo of hydrogen or derivatives and secures long-term purchase contracts that reduce financial risk. Spain announced more than EUR 10 billion in incentives for renewable hydrogen projects, and France committed another EUR 9 billion through 2030. The European Union also launched the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, channeling community funds to companies such as Air Liquide, Siemens, and Thyssenkrupp.

Projects are no longer just models. In the Netherlands, the NortH2 consortium led by Shell, RWE, and Equinor plans to install 10 GW of electrolysis by 2040 with an initial 1 GW phase operational in 2027. In Spain, the Puertollano plant is under construction and will produce 3,000 tons per year of green hydrogen with an investment of EUR 150 million. In Portugal, the Sines project aims to turn the country into an export hub for northern Europe.

The bet is clear. Europe seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, meet its climate commitments, and at the same time consolidate a new clean heavy industry. The risk is that demand will grow faster than supply and that dependency will shift from Moscow to Rabat, Riyadh, or Santiago. Europe wants energy autonomy but may end up importing yet another dependency painted green.

The United States and the IRA

The United States has burst into the green hydrogen race with one of the most ambitious climate policies in its history. The Inflation Reduction Act, approved in 2022, allocated USD 369 billion to clean energy and placed hydrogen at the center of the strategy. Every kilo of green hydrogen produced on U.S. soil receives up to USD 3 in direct subsidies. The effect was immediate. In less than two years, dozens of projects have been announced with investment commitments exceeding USD 40 billion.

The Department of Energy selected seven development poles in 2023, known as Hydrogen Hubs. Texas, California, the East Coast, and the Midwest lead this network. These hubs aim to decarbonize heavy sectors such as steel, fertilizers, and long-distance transport. The first plants will come online between 2026 and 2027 and already have supply contracts under negotiation.

The strategy seeks more than emissions reduction. Washington wants to displace China in the manufacture of electrolyzers and in the technological value chain. Green hydrogen is for the United States a climate tool, but above all an industrial and geopolitical one. The race to dominate it is being played out both in the market and in the factory.

China and Asia

China is today the worlds largest producer of hydrogen with more than 60% of global output, though most still comes from coal. Beijing has decided to change that matrix and lead the transition to green hydrogen. The country controls 40% of global electrolyzer capacity and its manufacturers offer equipment up to 30% cheaper than in the West.

The five-year plan includes more than 200 projects at different stages. Among them is the Ordos cluster in Inner Mongolia, which will add more than 1 GW of electrolysis before 2028. The state oil company Sinopec announced a USD 2.9 billion complex in Ulanqab that will produce 100,000 tons per year of green hydrogen. Altogether China has committed more than USD 33 billion to renewable hydrogen by 2030.

The strategy goes beyond production. China wants to dominate the entire value chain. Controlling the manufacturing of electrolyzers, fuel cells, and turbines ensures a privileged position vis--vis Europe and the United States. Japan and South Korea are advancing in parallel with projects for maritime transport, power generation, and ammonia exports. Asia as a whole understands that green hydrogen is not only clean energy but also an industrial and technological battleground.

The Middle East and Africa

The Persian Gulf seeks to convert its oil rents into renewable hegemony. Saudi Arabia leads the offensive with the NEOM megaproject, an USD 8.4 billion investment that will begin producing 600 tons per day of green hydrogen in 2026. The complex is designed to export green ammonia to Europe and Asia and to become the largest in the world. The United Arab Emirates is developing projects in Dubai and Abu Dhabi worth over USD 2 billion, linked to airlines and shipping companies seeking to decarbonize their supply chains.

Africa is also emerging as a key stage. Morocco plans to install 6 GW of electrolysis capacity before 2035 with European financing. Namibia signed agreements worth more than USD 10 billion for the Hyphen project, which should produce 300,000 tons per year of green hydrogen starting in 2027. Egypt is advancing in the Suez Canal area with USD 12 billion in investments to build export hubs to the Mediterranean.

The appeal lies in abundant sun and wind, but the risk is repeating colonial schemes. Europe is already negotiating long-term import contracts to secure part of the 10 million tons per year it wants to source from outside its territory by 2030. The problem is that local industrialization is advancing slowly. Without electrolyzer factories or their own value chains, Africa may become a cheap supplier while profits concentrate in the North.

Latin America

Latin America is seeking a place in the global green hydrogen race. Chile is the most advanced, with more than 70 projects at different stages and a projected investment portfolio close to USD 100 billion by 2030. The official goal is to produce 1 million tons per year of green hydrogen, mainly in Magallanes and Antofagasta. Companies such as HIF Global, Engie, and Enaex are leading initiatives to export e-fuels to Europe and Asia.

Brazil is betting on greater scale. In the ports of Pecm and Suape, potential investments exceed USD 200 billion by 2040. The country seeks to become an export hub thanks to abundant solar and wind resources. Several projects exceed 10 GW of electrolysis in planning and memorandums of understanding have already been signed with German and Japanese companies.

Colombia is moving forward with a goal of 3 GW of electrolysis by 2030 and export projections from the Caribbean coast. The government expects to attract more than USD 5 billion in private investment. Argentina, though lagging, is pushing pilots in Patagonia with an eye on exports to Europe and Asia.

The regional dilemma is clear. Countries have unique natural conditions, but the risk is repeating the history of copper, oil, or lithium. Exporting green hydrogen as a raw material without developing domestic industry could leave Latin America in a peripheral role. The alternative is to create local value chains that generate jobs, manufacturing, and technological sovereignty before export contracts define a path of no return.

Global risks

The green hydrogen race does not only bring opportunities. It also exposes deep risks that could transform the promise into a mirage. The first is the asymmetry between North and South. The United States and Germany subsidize, while countries like Chile or Colombia barely offer limited tax credits. That financing gap could leave much of the planet out of the competition.

Arisk is greenwashing. Not all hydrogen promoted as green really is. The lack of strict certification allows fossil electricity to be mixed into production. The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly 60% of the worlds hydrogen is still gray. Without clear rules, the credibility of the transition is at stake.

Infrastructure is another critical point. To reach the 2030 targets, the world will need more than 300,000 km of adapted pipelines and dozens of specialized ports to move hydrogen and derivatives such as ammonia and methanol. These investments exceed USD 500 billion and still lack secured financing.

Finally there is the geopolitical risk. Control of the value chain will determine new dependencies. If production is concentrated in a few countries and manufacturing in Asia, green hydrogen could cement an unequal map similar to oil. The energy transition could be born marked by the same tensions it sought to overcome.

Projects setting the global pace

Green hydrogen is no longer just a PowerPoint announcement. Across regions, there are projects producing at pilot scale and others entering mass operation within the next five years. The most emblematic is NEOM in Saudi Arabia, with an USD 8.4 billion investment and the capacity to generate 600 tons per day of green hydrogen from 2026. It will be the worlds largest complex and will export green ammonia to Europe and Asia.

Europe: NortH2 in the Netherlands and the North Sea, backed by Shell, RWE, and Equinor. The goal is 10 GW of electrolysis by 2040, with a first 1 GW phase in 2027. Germany is advancing with H2Global, which secures long-term contracts and subsidies of up to USD 5.5 per kilo.

United States: Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs, seven poles from Texas to California, already have over USD 40 billion in committed investments. The first plants will operate between 2026 and 2027.

China: Ordos cluster with more than 1 GW before 2028 and USD 33 billion committed in projects through 2030. Sinopecs Ulanqab complex alone requires USD 2.9 billion and will produce 100,000 tons per year.

Brazil: Pecm and Suape ports project more than USD 200 billion in investments by 2040, with planning goals exceeding 10 GW.

Namibia: Hyphen project, USD 10 billion, projected 300,000 tons per year starting in 2027.

The projects set the pulse of green hydrogen. They are not trials but industrial bets at continental scale. Their success or failure will determine whether green hydrogen ceases to be a promise and becomes a global energy reality.

The giants of green hydrogen

The global map of green hydrogen is best understood by looking at concrete projects with confirmed investments and defined capacity. These are not vague announcements but figures showing where the energy race is truly being played.

NEOM, Saudi Arabia: USD 8.4 billion investment, 600 tons per day of green hydrogen from 2026

NortH2, Netherlands: Target of 10 GW of electrolysis by 2040, 1 GW operational in 2027

Hydrogen Hubs, United States: 7 hubs with over USD 40 billion in investments, first plants in 2026 with initial capacity in the hundreds of thousands of tons per year

Sinopec Ulanqab, China: USD 2.9 billion investment, 100,000 tons per year of green hydrogen by 2028

China global commitment: More than USD 33 billion by 2030, over 200 projects at various stages

Brazil, Pecm and Suape: Projections of more than USD 200 billion by 2040, with planning targets exceeding 10 GW

Namibia, Hyphen: USD 10 billion, 300,000 tons per year projected from 2027

These projects mark the rhythm of green hydrogen. They are not experiments but industrial-scale bets. On their success or failure depends whether green hydrogen becomes a real global energy alternative.

Final reflections

Green hydrogen has become the planets new energy frontier. Europe, the United States, China, the Gulf, and Latin America are running with billions of dollars and promises of millions of tons per year. The official narrative presents it as the key to meeting climate targets and decarbonizing sectors impossible to electrify with traditional renewables.

But behind the figures lie open questions. Will green hydrogen be a driver of energy sovereignty or a new global dependency? Will it be a lever to create industry and jobs, or will the pattern repeat of exporting raw materials while buying expensive technology? The decade 20252035 will mark whether the world builds a just transition or whether the green mirage becomes another bubble inflated by subsidies.

Green hydrogen could be the lever that frees the planet from fossil fuels. It could also be just another mirage in the desert of unfulfilled promises. Everything will depend on how projects are executed, on the capacity to include regions and communities, and on whether the great powers understand that the future is measured not only in gigawatts or tons, but in justice, sovereignty, and shared dignity.

A coastal site that provides about one third of the UK's gas supply is ""ideally placed to be a carbon capture hub"", according to the region's energy group.

Kevin Keable, chair of East of England Energy Group, said Bacton Gas Terminal in Norfolk also had the potential to manufacture hydrogen as an alternative fuel to gas.

The same reservoirs that supply natural gas from below the North Sea could be used to store excess carbon dioxide (CO2) in a bid to reduce emissions.

""For net zero to happen, we need to capture that carbon and store it,"" said Mr Keable.

In October, the government pledged nearly £22bn for projects to capture and store CO2 - a process known as CCS.

But environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are concerned CCS could just prolong the burning of fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming.

Jonathan White is general manager of Perenco, which operates one of Bacton's terminals. He also co-leads the Poseidon Project which plans to pipe unwanted CO2 into the Leman gas field off the Suffolk coast.

""Some of the UK's carbon emissions come from burning gas and fossil fuels, as well as industrial processes – such as cement factories, sugar factories, waste incineration.

""If that can be captured and sent offshore to the same fields, then that's really good for the environment,"" said Mr White.

He said Bacton was well-placed to set up a CCS system.

""The expertise we have of gas is somewhat transferable. We have a very skilled workforce that knows how to work in a difficult offshore environment.""

He said Perenco had not developed facilities to capture carbon, but had run tests pumping 4,000 tonnes of liquid CO2 into the Poseidon site.

""Perenco proved the tech and pumped carbon away in some vast quantities – it is definitely achievable,"" said Mr Keable.

Critics of CCS, such as Greenpeace, say it only ""extends the life of planet-heating oil and gas production"".

There are concerns it will not scale up in time to make a dent in carbon emissions, which scientists say must dramatically reduce to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

Globally, more than 35 billion tonnes of carbon are emitted each year, but only 50 million tonnes are currently captured by about 45 CCS sites, according to the International Energy Agency.

Meanwhile, Mr Keable said, Bacton could be producing hydrogen by 2030.

Hydrogen does not give off greenhouse gases when it is used, but producing the fuel can involve burning gas - known as ""blue hydrogen"".

However ""green hydrogen"" can also be created using surplus wind or solar energy

""Green hydrogen is the future,"" said Mr Keable.

""For today we're talking about blue hydrogen from gas and green hydrogen from wind farms, using electricity.

""Bacton could become the UK's new energy gateway, storing carbon, producing hydrogen and securing local business and jobs for decades, whilst tackling climate change.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3ac0/live/b1ee1200-957f-11f0-bf42-45e64f25c5d0.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 13:03:02.777636

President Donald Trump's Justice Department has intervened — and taken the side of Canadian oil and gas transport giant Enbridge — in Enbridge's federal lawsuit attempting to stop Gov.
Whitmer in November 2020 announced her intention to revoke Enbridge's 1953 easement with the state to use state-controlled Great Lakes bottomlands for the Straits pipeline.
Enbridge officials have countered that the Line 5 pipeline in the Straits has always remained safe and cite recurring inspections by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, affirming its contention.

The Justice Dept. is siding with Enbridge's contentions that Michigan's attempts to revoke its Line 5 easement interfere with federal regulation of pipelines, and U.S.-Canadian treaties.

President Donald Trump's Justice Department has intervened — and taken the side of Canadian oil and gas transport giant Enbridge — in Enbridge's federal lawsuit attempting to stop Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from revoking the company's 72-year-old easement to operate the Line 5 underwater oil and gas pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac lake bottom.

The U.S. Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division and Civil Division announced its filing of a ""statement of interest"" in a lawsuit filed by Enbridge against Whitmer and Michigan Department of Natural Resources Director Scott Bowen in U.S. District Court in Lansing.

The Justice Department is agreeing with Enbridge's assertion in the suit that the Michigan action improperly attempts to override federal authority on interstate pipeline regulation, and federal foreign affairs authority as the pipeline from Alberta, Canada, is subject to U.S.-Canadian treaties.

""The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation's statutory authority,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement.

""President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.""

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's Office did not immediately respond to a Free Press request for comment.

Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes, in an emailed statement to the Free Press, noted the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty between the United States and Canada ""expressly prevents public authorities such as the State of Michigan and courts from unilaterally shutting down the pipeline.""

""We will continue to protect and defend Line 5's continued operations consistent with federal law, interstate commerce, and international treaty agreements, all of which recognize the critical role Line 5 plays in providing for the region's energy needs and its economic strength,"" he said.

Built in 1953, Enbridge's Line 5 moves 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids per day east through the Upper Peninsula, splitting into twin underwater pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac bottom, before returning to a single transmission pipeline through the Lower Peninsula that runs south to Sarnia, Ontario. Many have expressed concern about the aging pipes over several years, as anchor strikes, missing pipeline supports and loss of protective pipeline coating have been discovered.

A 30-inch oil transmission line also owned by Enbridge ruptured in July 2010 in Marshall, spilling more than 1.1 million gallons of oil, fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River and prompting a cleanup that took four years and more than $1 billion. Many fear a similar pipeline mishap on the Straits bottom, where Great Lakes Michigan and Huron meet, would be greatly more devastating.

Whitmer in November 2020 announced her intention to revoke Enbridge's 1953 easement with the state to use state-controlled Great Lakes bottomlands for the Straits pipeline. Whitmer's office at the time cited Enbridge's ""persistent and incurable violations of the easement’s terms and conditions"" related to safety and maintenance.

""Enbridge has routinely refused to take action to protect our Great Lakes and the millions of Americans who depend on them for clean drinking water and good jobs,"" Whitmer said at the time. ""They have repeatedly violated the terms of the 1953 easement by ignoring structural problems that put our Great Lakes and our families at risk.""

Enbridge officials have countered that the Line 5 pipeline in the Straits has always remained safe and cite recurring inspections by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, affirming its contention.

In its filing, the Justice Department notes that the federal government took ""decisive action"" in three environmental events described in Whitmer's notice to revoke the Enbridge easement, including an April 2018 anchor strike that dented the outer Straits pipelines and the discovery of significant damage to a pipeline support in June 2020. Following the 2018 anchor strike, Congress amended federal pipeline safety laws, and PHMSA issued an interim final rule to protect the Great Lakes and connecting waters, the Justice Department's filing states.

""By revisiting these same incidents to impose different standards and different results, Michigan is not only thwarting Congressional intent to promote a nationally uniform safety program but also is creating an unworkable patchwork of state standards for interim pipelines,"" the Justice Department states in its court filing.

The Justice Department filing also declares the Michigan action infringes upon ""significant interests of the United States in its conduct of foreign affairs,"" adding the United States has a significant interest in an ""affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy"" that the state easement revocation attempt threatens.

Enbridge proposes to build a 21-foot diameter, 3.6-mile tunnel underneath the bed of the Straits of Mackinac to house a new, 30-inch diameter pipeline to move the oil and natural gas liquids. The tunnel pipeline would replace the twin pipes currently on the Straits bottom.

Michigan Supreme Court allows tribes to appeal MPSC approval of Line 5 tunnel

In other litigation related to Line 5, on Friday, Sept. 19, the Michigan Supreme Court granted an appeal by multiple Michigan Native American tribes and nonprofit environmental groups to challenge the Michigan Public Service Commission's approval of the Line 5 tunnel.

The Supreme Court is allowing a review of whether the state Court of Appeals erred in providing weight to earlier lower court rulings rather than considering on its own whether the proposed tunnel ""will pollute, impair, or destroy the air, water or state's other natural resources or the public trust in these resources."" The high court will also consider whether the MPSC should have excluded ""evidence of the history and risk of oil spills along the entire length of Line 5"" as it approved the tunnel.

“The tunnel project and the dual pipelines are just two versions of one terrible idea that threatens to destroy our clean water, our fishing, and our way of life for the sake of Canadian profits,” said Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle. “Our choice is not between the dual pipelines and the tunnel. Our choice is between an oil spill in the Great Lakes and a clean water future for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. We simply want government officials to consider the safest, cheapest, and most commonsense alternative: Decommission Line 5.”

Barnes said a tunnel allowing for a new oil and gas pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac ""makes what has always been a safe pipeline even safer.""

In fact, the majority of America’s nuclear power plants were built between 1970 and 1990.
The nuclear power plants of the future won’t all look like Plant Vogle’s enormous cooling towers.
There’s one more aspect of a nuclear renaissance that’s important to note: The jobs.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

As our state, America, and the world grapple with how to produce enough power to keep up with AI data center demand and keep the lights on (and affordable!), more people are talking about a “nuclear renaissance.” But what does that mean?

Nuclear power provides about 19 percent of our nation’s electricity – a little less than the 21 percent we now get from renewable sources, including solar. Until Georgia Power’s Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle were completed, no new nuclear had been constructed in the US in decades. In fact, the majority of America’s nuclear power plants were built between 1970 and 1990. I’ve been inside a few of them, and as you might imagine of 50-year-old infrastructure, the interiors look a lot like your grandmother’s kitchen.

The merger of the energy and technology sectors, however, is driving a nuclear renaissance. Rising demand from AI data centers not only means that America needs more power than we have today, we need denser sources of power that can generate more megawatts on less land. Pairing energy-dense resources like nuclear with large loads like AI data centers may be one way to power our future without gobbling up forests and farmland – so long as we maintain our commitment to public health, safety, and environmental quality.

The nuclear power plants of the future won’t all look like Plant Vogle’s enormous cooling towers. Emerging technologies like Small Modular Reactors (or SMRs) are the size of a football field, and advanced technologies like those used by nuclear start-ups Kairos and Oklo have an even smaller footprint.

While nuclear’s energy-dense, reliable clean power is a good match to America’s surging energy demand, it doesn’t come cheap. The first-of-its-kind of any new technology is more expensive, even though costs come down with each new implementation. So who will pay for it?

Increasingly, the same tech titans that need enormous energy resources for their AI data centers are stepping up to bear the costs. Google, for example, has partnered with Kairos to build a new nuclear facility in the Tennessee Valley. Microsoft is signing purchase agreements to help bring additional nuclear power online. And the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose membership includes the biggest energy users in the world, has become an influential advocate for nuclear energy. Tech titans and other big energy users paying their fair share is one way to keep energy affordable for American families.

There’s one more aspect of a nuclear renaissance that’s important to note: The jobs. If America leads, it will create abundant opportunities for engineers, nuclear operators, electricians, the craft trades, manufacturing, and more. And that’s the other thing that stood out when I toured some of our region’s nuclear facilities – the excitement of the young men and women who worked there about being on the frontier of Made in America energy innovation.",https://www.lagrangenews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2025/07/lagrange-logo-lg.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 11:00:14.496949

It was a dramatized, Gilded Age-type demonstration of Trump’s AI Action Plan, which grants Big Tech the unfettered ability to expand AI infrastructure.

Announced in July 2025, Trump’s AI plan aims to accelerate the construction of data centers by bypassing public protections, environmental laws, and critical oversight. This push for federal deregulation is a direct response to more and more local communities fighting back to unveil who actually benefits from these massive investments — and who is being sold out in the process. Data centers powering AI require an enormous amount of water and energy. A single data center can consume up to 5 million gallons of drinking water per day. A data center campus using one gigawatt of electric power annually would use more power in a year than consumers use in Alaska, Rhode Island, or Vermont. As tech companies scramble to build data centers in the relentless “AI race,” they are creating infrastructure that will lock us into burning fossil fuels for decades. They are seeking a future where we have to compete with corporations for drinking water and subsidize Big Tech’s energy costs with our own wallets due to increased utility bills.

In their search for cheap land, cheap energy, and cities and towns that have been structurally disempowered, Big Tech has descended upon the South. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon have committed over $200 billion to build medium and large data centers in North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. As the South becomes the new epicenter of data center growth, it is becoming increasingly clear that Big Tech is following Big Oil’s footsteps, compounding the harms of decades of environmental racism in the South.

Elon Musk’s $12 billion artificial intelligence company, xAI, is poisoning Black communities in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk’s supercomputer, Colossus, sits a few miles from Boxtown, where nearly half of the residents have an annual household income below $25,000 and the cancer rates are four times the national average. According to the Southern Environmental Law Center, the data center has been fueled by 35 unpermitted gas turbines that produce smog-forming pollution and harmful chemicals like formaldehyde. Peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels have increased by 79 percent from pre-xAI levels in the areas immediately surrounding the data center. Nitrogen dioxide is linked to respiratory diseases. Memphis already leads Tennessee in emergency department visits for asthma and received an “F” from the American Lung Association for ozone pollution in 2025. Memphis resident KeShaun Pearson states, “We are breathing dirtier air, experiencing higher rates of asthma, and our children are spending more time in emergency rooms due to the misguided ambitions of billionaires who don’t see us as human.”

Similarly, Meta’s largest data center to date is being built in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where over a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. Meta’s $10 billion complex will consume an unprecedented amount of energy from the state — approximately three times as much electricity as the entire city of New Orleans annually. According to the permit for the data center, it will directly emit 5,862 tons of CO2 annually, equal to the annual emissions of 1,108 homes in the U.S. Three new methane gas plants are being built just to power this one data center. Two of the power plants will be built in Richland Parish, while the third power plant will be built at an existing nuclear power plant site in the region known as “Cancer Alley.” Cancer Alley is an 85-mile stretch of land along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where Black and low-income communities have been getting sick and dying for decades due to emissions from over 200 petrochemical and fossil fuel plants in the area.

In South Carolina, power plants are being built in predominantly Black communities to keep up with data centers’ energy needs. In Mississippi, the state’s Public Service Commission unanimously approved a special contract to extend the life of a Mississippi Power coal unit, Plant Victor J. Daniel, to meet energy needs for a new data center project. This comes after the state government had ordered the utility company to phase out coal in 2020 due to its detrimental impacts on health and the environment. In 2022, Plant Victor J. Daniel reported more than 6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, higher than any other facility in Mississippi, according to Grist. The plant has also been reported to be one of the nation’s top groundwater polluters, with excessive amounts of lithium, which is associated with neurological damage.

Big Tech has pushed rapid data center development forward through opaque and corrupt processes to avoid public scrutiny. Wanda Mosley, a resident of South Fulton, Georgia, told Truthout that the public processes related to data center development have been biased, saying, “They’re holding these town halls but they’re only having people who benefit from the data centers speaking at the town halls.”

In Georgia, county commissioners have been easing requirements for Project Sail, a data center which would use up to 6 million gallons of water per day — over a fifth of the entire county’s daily water allotment. Officials adopted new planning laws which were watered down by industry lobbyists and removed provisions that aimed to limit harmful environmental impacts and that would require special public hearings for proposed data centers. This was only revealed through a public records request that matched anonymous comments with emails.

Major project developers in the South have concealed key information from the public, including water and energy consumption, deals with local officials regarding tax breaks and other incentives, and even company names. Local politicians make backdoor deals with tech companies before the public has a chance to be fully informed of the harms and have a say in data centers entering their communities. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina all provide major tax exemptions for data center companies. Louisiana’s GOP-controlled legislature fast-tracked Act 730 in 2024, granting data center companies 20-year tax exemptions, extendable to 30 years, for projects creating just 50 jobs and investing at least $200 million. The bill was championed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and corporate lobbyists, under the guise of economic development.

Big Tech promises thousands of jobs when data center projects are announced. However, in reality, data centers create very few permanent jobs. Even Microsoft admits that a data center can run with less than 50 technicians. According to a Business Insider analysis, “tax breaks given to developers can amount over time to more than $2 million for every permanent, full-time job at an operational data center.” Despite the widespread talking point that data centers bring jobs to local areas, half the states that provide tax subsidies for data centers do not actually require job creation. States that do only require a small number of jobs to be created. In Tennessee, only 15 jobs are required for data centers to qualify for tax breaks.

CNBC reports that states are forfeiting hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue to tech companies. Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, called this “a giant transfer of wealth from taxpayers to shareholders.” These tax breaks divert funds away from direct government expenditures in support of schools, tackling income inequality, investing in public transit, environmental remediation and other community needs. This affects marginalized communities the most, especially communities of color in the South. Georgia is projected to waive roughly $296 million in sales tax revenue this year for large data centers. This economic extraction through subsidies parallels the fossil fuel industry.

These subsidies extend beyond state tax breaks. In South Carolina, Dominion Energy will provide electricity to Google for multiple data centers at a discounted rate that amounts to less than half of what residential customers have to pay. Dominion has not disclosed how much electricity it is going to provide to Google data centers, saying the information is a protected trade secret. However, data centers in South Carolina will drive a whopping 65 to 70 percent of the state’s increased energy use, forcing consumers to pay more in utility bills. Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, has stated, “The highest low-income energy burden is seen in the South, specifically in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas.” Energy burden refers to the percentage of personal income needed to pay energy bills. Data centers will exacerbate this systemic inequity.

The South has long been a site of both corporate extraction and fierce political resistance. Continuing this legacy of resistance, data center opposition is increasingly strong across the South. A proposed $14.5 billion hyperscale data center in Bessemer, Alabama, has been paused after facing a united front of residents concerned with the data center’s local impact. The center would require 2 million gallons of water per day, or roughly the same amount of water as two thirds of the city’s population. In Warrenton, Virginia, residents voted out all town council members in the November 2024 election who supported Amazon’s proposed data center. In July 2025, the newly elected council voted to ban data centers from Warrenton. In Georgia, the Monroe County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to deny a data center proposal that would rezone 900 acres of land after residents pushed back and said it posed environmental threats.

Mosley, the South Fulton resident, told Truthout:

They don’t understand what they have started. They don’t understand the coalition that we’re about to build, because all of us have high electricity bills. All of us have high water bills. And so, people who don’t normally rock together, oh, we about to rock together, and we are about to make some changes in Georgia.

It is critical that we pay attention to fights like these and stand in solidarity with the Black, brown and working-class communities being harmed by Big Tech and federal and state governments.

,Louisiana Environment,2025-09-20 12:23:27+00:00,American Press,Jim Beam column:Carbon capture gets major OK | American Press,Jim Beam,,,,,https://americanpress.com/2025/09/20/jim-beam-columncarbon-capture-gets-major-ok/,"Carbon capture is the technology that injects high-pressure carbon dioxide in a near liquid state into formations deep underground in order to protect the environment.
The newspaper said grassroots opposition has grown in some areas of conservative-leaning rural Louisiana where major storage operations are proposed.
The storage operation by the Sempra arm, Hackberry Carbon Sequestration, would allow the company to cut the carbon intensity of its nearby liquefied natural gas facility, Cameron LNG, in a remote corner of Cameron Parish.
Many carbon capture opponents find it hard to forget the Bayou Corne sinkhole first discovered on Aug. 3, 2012, that caused the collapse of a salt dome cavern in Assumption Parish.
However, like it or not, carbon capture appears to have become an accepted process.","Since Southwest Louisiana is considered to be this nation’s unofficial LNG capital, it should come as no surprise that Cameron LNG at Hackberry has received approval for the state’s first authorized carbon capture and storage well.

The Advocate reported that the order from the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources (DENR) comes more than a year and a half after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted DENR its authority to permit wells for the new technology.

Carbon capture is the technology that injects high-pressure carbon dioxide in a near liquid state into formations deep underground in order to protect the environment. The newspaper said grassroots opposition has grown in some areas of conservative-leaning rural Louisiana where major storage operations are proposed.

The authority issued by DENR was based on well drilling, seismic testing, computer modeling and other data. The new Class VI permit near Hackberry would allow an arm of Sempra Infrastructure to build a well that could pump up to 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually for 20 years under Black Lake southwest of Lake Charles.

The project would create more than 200 construction jobs and up to 10 operating jobs. It will include a proposed well site, compression facility and a 9-mile pipeline routed along existing rights of way to minimize impact.

This project is among 33 being proposed statewide. While it is the first approval in Louisiana, a handful of approvals have been permitted nationwide.

The storage operation by the Sempra arm, Hackberry Carbon Sequestration, would allow the company to cut the carbon intensity of its nearby liquefied natural gas facility, Cameron LNG, in a remote corner of Cameron Parish.

Hackberry Carbon officials said the permit is an important milestone, but cautioned that the project still needs additional engineering, commercial agreements and other approvals before the company can seek state authority to inject CO2 underground.

State officials said the authorization to inject is more of an in-house permit that comes after drilling verifies well conditions are as expected. The CO2 would be stored approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth’s surface in layers separated by impermeable shale rock.

The storage layers between the shale contain highly concentrated brine that isn’t suitable for drinking. The nearest freshwater aquifer stops at 1,090 feet underground. The company’s consultant said the concentrated area would be a mile or more from the nearest underground faults or oil and gas or other wells.

State officials said they are making sure measures are in place to protect taxpayers long-term and avoid the kind of liability Louisiana currently has with orphaned oil and gas wells.

DENR officials detailed ways that they and Hackberry will be able to track movement of the CO2 plume through the years, primarily through the seismic and microgravity testing. The agency noted this and other continued testing should catch something that doesn’t match the modeling.

Many carbon capture opponents find it hard to forget the Bayou Corne sinkhole first discovered on Aug. 3, 2012, that caused the collapse of a salt dome cavern in Assumption Parish. And they continue to express concerns about the new process.

The community science director for Healthy Gulf said DENR “is undertaking a new era of destruction of our waters and our coastal wetlands before fixing the hundreds of idle and broken oil wells in Black Lake or ensuring the drinking water for Sulphur.”

Scott Eustis added that at least 149 inactive or older oil and gas wells are within 2.5 miles of Black Lake and 259 active drinking wells north of the injection zone. He said the Hackberry company should have to plug those inactive wells, but the company’s application says they are far from the projected plume.

Industry groups counter that the new technology has a large economic impact.

David Cresson, president and chief executive officer of the Louisiana Chemical Association and the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance, said, “This landmark decision (approval of the permit) not only cements Louisiana’s role as a front-runner in carbon capture in the U.S., but also directly addresses the surging global demand for low to zero-carbon products.”

Legislators have offered landowners some protections but not as many as they wanted. However, like it or not, carbon capture appears to have become an accepted process. Let’s hope all the safety features have been checked and double-checked.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/09/CC-voisplanet.png,N,,2025-09-20 11:01:04.090727

He also said this will impact the local economy by causing 20,000 to 30,000 people who work for wind/solar projects to lose their jobs.
Krishnamoorthi said that by staying in the wind/solar market, it could help the U.S. stay ahead in the global market.","President Donald Trump has made several industry and claimed it's .

Now, a congressman from Illinois is pushing back.

""The reason why electricity prices are going up is because that clean energy is not being allowed to come online, not that it exists,"" said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi.

Krishnamoorthi stating that are ""driving up energy bills for Illinoisans"" and asked for more support with clean energy, not less.

""It doesn't make any sense to remove electricity or the supply of electricity from the grid. That is just a dumb policy. We need as much supply as possible to drive down prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

He said that energy demand is rising due to overall usage going up, and also because of data centers being built.

But, he said with Trump's insistence on stopping wind and solar energy projects, supply for that energy is not able to keep up.

And, Illinois families will bear the consequences, possibly seeing their energy bills go up by an average of $180 per year.

He also said this will impact the local economy by causing 20,000 to 30,000 people who work for wind/solar projects to lose their jobs.

""Think about your neighbors who are working on these projects...I can't tell you how many good paying union jobs, for instance, are related to the construction of these projects,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""The loss of those jobs also hurt our local economy. So, in so many ways, he's [Trump] making the affordability crisis worse right now.""

Krishnamoorthi said that by staying in the wind/solar market, it could help the U.S. stay ahead in the global market.

""If we don't do these projects, we seed leadership to the Chinese Communist Party, which is trying to eat our lunch. They are trying to own the entire market for renewables around the world,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""Now, we actually have a fighting chance of defeating them in this competition for renewables around the world because we're starting to develop our own technology. New indigenous supply chains are growing and emerging in the U.S., but they're unfortunately getting knee capped by the Trump administration's approach, which doesn't make any sense in the world.""

Trump has changed and lessened with the which Krishnamoorthi argues doesn't make sense, since fossil fuels also rely on help from the government.

""What I can say is that there are subsidies for fossil fuels that also exist that deprive the federal government of important revenues, because those interests are very powerful. So, let's just be honest about what is the true cost of fossil fuel exploration...if fossil fuel interests or anybody else, is allowed to successfully remove these tax credits, they may profit, but it's going to be at our expense,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

But he wants to be clear his stance is overall more energy on the grid.

""You don't have to be against having a home that's powered by natural gas or driving a car that uses gasoline to also be in favor of wind and solar and other types of energy coming online. If you have more of everything, then we have lower prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

By 2025, total U.S. ESS and EV battery demand is expected to reach 192 GWh, up 20% year-on-year.
Bernstein forecasts ESS growth of 50% to 51 GWh, while EV battery demand will grow only 13%.
This is likely to outpace demand growth of 20-30%,” the firm said.","The U.S. energy storage system (ESS) market is expanding rapidly, providing a potential cushion for Korean battery manufacturers facing slower growth in electric vehicles (EVs), according to Bernstein.

“The U.S. energy storage market is experiencing robust growth, with installations up 57% year-to-date to 23.7 GWh,” Bernstein said.

ESS growth is “outpacing the growth in solar and wind capacity,” with demand driven by grid resilience needs amid rising electrification and AI. Key states fueling this surge include Texas, California, Arizona, and Northern Virginia.

By 2025, total U.S. ESS and EV battery demand is expected to reach 192 GWh, up 20% year-on-year. Bernstein forecasts ESS growth of 50% to 51 GWh, while EV battery demand will grow only 13%. “ESS is expected to account for 27% of the total which would be the highest ever,” the analysts wrote.

Trade tensions are reportedly reshaping the competitive landscape. “Current tariffs on Chinese ESS batteries are around 40% today and rising to 58% starting in 2026,” Bernstein noted, which could support U.S.-made batteries.

Korean manufacturers are said to be moving quickly: Bernstein notes that has already begun U.S. LFP production, with and SK On set to follow in 2026. also plans LFP cell output in Nevada.

Samsung SDI is seen as the most aggressive in shifting capacity, with “over half of SDI’s battery manufacturing capacity will be dedicated to ESS applications (20 GWh) by YE26.”

The firm added that LGES will have the largest U.S. ESS capacity at 30 GWh, though this is just 15% of its 215 GWh total.

Still, Bernstein warned that despite booming ESS demand, oversupply looms. “US battery manufacturing capacity is projected to rise significantly from 338GWh YE25 to 601 GWh by YE26, representing a robust 78% y-o-y increase.

They also point to studies prepared for industry groups which found that more battery storage will save consumers money in the long run.","After twice failing to pass an energy reform package this year, lawmakers and renewable energy advocates are aiming to reach a deal in time for a brief legislative session in October.

The bill, in its current form, would create a surcharge on electric bills to incentivize battery storage developments, loosen state-level nuclear regulations, institute new energy efficiency requirements and more.

Many advocacy groups are hoping to get a major bill passed this year, but one influential lawmaker is beginning to hedge as lawmakers’ veto session approaches.

“This is still a work in progress,” Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Caledonia, said at a Thursday subject matter hearing on the bill. “Should the bills come back before the Senate, we will have another subject matter on the legislation or we could craft a different proposal in another bill.”

Stadelman, who chairs the Senate Energy and Public Utilities, noted at the end of that hearing a final package could come “this fall or next spring.” He also said the committee will hold another hearing in early October.

House Bill 4116 contains the latest proposals, which are largely similar to legislation considered at the end of May, only with an updated timeline.

Nuclear power politics

In the latest round of negotiations, stakeholders have been largely focusing on the electricity demand created by data centers. These always-on, power-hungry facilities are a key aspect of Illinois’ economic development strategy, and the state has offered several data center companies tax incentives to locate here.

The data center industry has advocated for the use of increased nuclear energy to meet that demand.

Dan Diorio, head of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, pointed to a recent deal between Constellation Energy Corporation, the owner of Illinois’ nuclear power plants, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Starting next year, Meta will purchase “renewable energy attributes” from the nuclear facility in Clinton, providing the financial incentive to keep the plant open for two decades after state subsidies run out.

The industry is backing a proposal that would lift a state-level moratorium on new nuclear power stations.

“Data center companies are adding nuclear power to their energy portfolios because it’s carbon-free, scalable, safe and provides reliable base load power,” Diorio said.

But environmental advocates are wary of lifting the moratorium. Sierra Club Executive Director Jack Darin said he wanted the nuclear moratorium to be part of broader talks about data center regulations in the spring session.

“The other reason to maybe take a breath here is because of really significant changes that are happening to the federal regulatory oversight of the nuclear industry,” Darin said.

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump ordered sweeping changes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the aim of quadrupling nuclear power capacity in the U.S. over the next 25 years.

The concept of lifting the moratorium has received bipartisan support, including from Gov. JB Pritzker, although the exact details would have to be ironed out in legislation.

Battery storage funding

The centerpiece of the proposed legislation is a new state funding mechanism to incentivize energy storage projects.

“Batteries can serve as an arbitrage mechanism, storing surplus energy during periods when electricity is ample and inexpensive and discharging it during high-priced peak periods,” Sarah Moskowitz, head of the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board, said.

Moskowitz also said storage can help the grid maintain reliability by replacing or delaying the need for more expensive or slow-to-deploy energy generation.

“The sooner we invest in a solution, the sooner we can pull out of this cycle of record-breaking electricity price increases,” Stephanie Burgos-Veras, an organizer with the industry-backed Solar Powers Illinois campaign, said in a statement. “The most expensive path forward is to not pass anything in veto session.”

A May analysis from the Illinois Power Agency, which manages electricity purchasing in the state, found that adding 6 gigawatts of battery storage to the grid — the equivalent of several power plants worth of batteries — would reduce costs to consumers by about $2.70 per month in northern Illinois and about $7.50 in downstate Illinois.

Read more: Illinois bet on solar to meet its climate goals. Trump has the industry in his crosshairs.

The current proposal would incentivize battery storage in a similar way to renewable energy projects — by adding a surcharge to utility customer bills. This gives developers a financial guarantee that they can leverage to obtain private financing for the bulk of project costs.

Consumer advocates like Moskowitz are strongly in favor of this proposal. But some question cost savings claims.

“I think the IPA analysis assumptions were disingenuous to set up a narrative that this will save ratepayers money,” Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, told Capitol News Illinois. “And that’s simply not true.”

Rezin advocated for cost caps to limit the amount of money charged to ratepayers if IPA procurements cost more than expected.

Others, notably industrial businesses and manufacturers, don’t want any surcharge on the bill. Instead, they propose requiring battery developers to get state-backed loans from the Illinois Finance Authority.

“This results in savings to them (battery storage developers) and savings to Illinois ratepayers and, more importantly, does not put another line item on the bill for Illinois consumers to pay for something,” Phillip Golden, chairman of Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, said.

This proposal has sparked some dissent among Senate Democrats. Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, earlier this month announced he was backing a proposal to use loans from the IFA as the finance vehicle for storage projects.

“Instead of soaking ratepayers for even more money, as some propose, the businesses that are going to reap the rewards should also take the risk,” Preston said in an early September statement.

Proponents of using a ratepayer surcharge say the model’s use in renewables is evidence that it can be successful. They also point to studies prepared for industry groups which found that more battery storage will save consumers money in the long run.

Is it really possible from a legal/constitutional perspective for the Trump administration to sell off public lands across the American West to the highest bidding developers and resource extractors as threatened?

MG Daly, Burlingame, CA

National parks, wildlife refuges, forests, and other public land is at risk of being sold and exploited by the Trump administration. This land is owned by the American people, yet the administration hopes to pass legislation to increase development, logging, mining, and sell our lands to private owners. President Trump’s secretary of the interior Doug Burgum stated that these resources are “national assets” and could be used to reduce national debt. And these projects aren’t new. When Trump was in office in 2017, he set into motion an executive order that aimed to reduce the size of monuments greater than 100,000 acres in size, claiming that it was “another egregious use of government power.” This was abolished in Biden's presidency, and many people challenged Trump’s reduction.

Recent news has reported that the Trump administration has already removed vital protection for two lands in order to increase mining for mineral production. Trump has also issued an executive order that plans to identify public lands that may have mineral deposits to increase mining there, no matter whether the land is protected or a national monument.

But is this legally possible? The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976 outlines management and protection guidelines for the federal government for the purpose of enhancing public lands in federal ownership. It does permit the sale of land, but only under certain criteria such as public interest. Many Native American tribes and environmental activists argue that Trump’s actions go beyond the President's power and require congressional approval.

If we take a look at the Constitution, this rings true. In Article 4, it is stated that Congress, not the President “shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.” This essentially means that land sales largely require Congress to be involved.

Additionally, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to make an assessment of environmental impact prior to legal action. Despite these clear regulations being in place, the Trump administration can find loopholes. By reducing the power of conservation laws, proposing land sales to FLMPA, and changing the classification of certain lands to allow for private leasing, selling public land isn’t impossible.

If President Trump succeeds in implementing these orders, the damage would be massive. Animals face habitat destruction and pollution. This is also a bipartisan issue. Most Americans are in opposition to the reduction of national parks and public land. To take a stand against this issue, raise awareness by participating in protests against the Trump Administration. For instance, just last week, there was a protest through Yosemite National Park.

Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.

The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles the Trump administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.

Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.

Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.

“I’ve worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I’m ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”

Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.

“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”

California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition

Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.

Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”

But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”

While Randolph’s air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.

“Liane didn’t have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”

For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists. In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.

Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the board through a difficult time.

In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions.

“She’s always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”

Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions.

The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.

“There’s not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration’s attacks on all of California’s efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California’s authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.

“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”

Searing climate battles at home

Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel.

The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.

Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties.

“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.

Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.

“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what’s working — and what’s not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that’s not something staff have ever embraced.”

Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.

Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.

Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.

“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.

Newsom’s point person steps in

Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.

Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”

Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.

“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”

Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.

“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.

Next week, the state’s top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.

Many of the air board’s recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.

Forest envelopes Eli Lilly’s new campus, a 58-acre site halfway around a long looped road in Research Triangle Park where the company manufactures popular weight-loss and diabetes medications.

“I think it brings a beautiful aesthetic,” Daniel VonDielingen, an Eli Lilly senior vice president of manufacturing, said in late July during a facility tour.

This aesthetic, seclusion as a selling point, has defined Research Triangle Park since state leaders opened the economic zone in the 1950s. Nearly half the size of Manhattan, RTP was made for employees to commute into and drive out of.

Fidelity Investments today maintains the park’s largest workforce at its office complex in the woods. Cisco, another major RTP employer, has occupied more than 10 buildings around a lake and a pond since the 1990s. And years before Eli Lilly bought its local campus in 2020, the shielded site was owned by GlaxoSmithKline.

These layouts are no accident. RTP straddles Durham and Wake counties, and each local government sets special zoning designations that require park campuses to have large buffers and low density. The maximum building height is 120 feet. Around 20% of RTP, 1,400 acres, is parking lots.

This suited past tenants, but park leaders now have a 50-year plan to evolve alongside the booming region and modern work trends. “The old RTP model of this very suburban, auto-oriented campus really doesn’t align with what we’re seeing in demand for both an office market perspective and a town perspective,” said Travis Crayton, head of planning and public policy at the Research Triangle Foundation, which manages the park.

The first change (called RTP 2.0) opened five years ago, when the Foundation launched Hub RTP, a quasi-downtown area that today offers office, retail, dining and — in a park first — apartments. The next change has a longer timeline. Under “RTP 3.0,” park leaders wish to give developers flexibility to convert low-density, tree-lined campuses into mixed-use areas with shops, restaurants, grocery stores, towers and additional residential neighborhoods.

The Triangle’s population has never been higher, and post-pandemic, many residents maintain hybrid office schedules. “Being able to provide those amenities in close proximity to a workplace, that’s what you’re seeing the most successful office leasing have in this market today,” Crayton said.

In June, Wake County revised its zoning ordinances to fit the RTP 3.0 vision. Durham County is rewriting its entire unified development ordinance, and Crayton has advocated for its leaders to pass park rezoning faster through a standalone action. Nida Allam, chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners, told me she supports rezoning the park with housing and a transit station to make it more accessible.

“Much of our growth is within city limits,” she said. “But so many of our jobs are within RTP.”

Crayton anticipates Durham will green light the RTP rezoning plan in November. Then, after a few internal votes, the park can get started on its big reinvention.

Coffee man vs. coffee machine at Lenovo

Proximity made the juxtaposition hard to ignore. Standing to the right, behind a mobile coffee cart, human barista Cameron Keith of Raleigh’s Arbour Coffee served drinks for guests touring Lenovo’s upgraded Executive Briefing Center in Research Triangle Park.

And a few yards away was the Coffee Robot, a fully automated system Lenovo displayed Monday alongside its data center liquid cooling apparatuses and a six-legged robotic dog.

Coffee Robot is manufactured by a company called Hestia Robotics USA with Lenovo software and screens. It has milk dispensers, syrup pumps and latte art capabilities. A mechanical arm waves to customers from behind a clear barrier as it delivers one of 200 drink variations. It’s pitched as performing the work of two employees, said Milo Speranzo, Lenovo’s North America chief marketing officer.

Keith and his wife started their coffee catering business last year. Are robots new competition? “I think people want that personal touch,” Keith told me during Monday’s event. “And we’re bringing a happy experience to you. I think that’s a little differentiator there.”

Coffee Robot is in a handful of hospitals and airports, including Austin, Dallas and San Francisco. Speranzo said there’s demand from high-traffic spaces that struggle to find employees, particularly skilled baristas.

And after watching it work all morning, Keith admitted it was a pretty cool concept.

Duke investigation silence

When does no news become news? In late July, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon threatened to sever all Duke Health federal funding if the Durham medical system did not address allegations of racial discrimination. Their letter didn’t cite examples, but prominent DEI opponents have criticized Duke’s efforts to promote diversity in its residency programs.

Kennedy and McMahon gave Duke 10 business days to decide whether it would form a “Merit and Civil Rights Committee” to review internal practices and 20 business days to respond to the government’s information request under an investigation conducted by the Health Department’s Office for Civil Rights.

With both deadlines past, Duke University continues to not say how it has responded. Nor did the federal health or education departments answer requests for updates this week. In early August, the White House confirmed to The N&O that it had frozen $108 million for Duke. It did not publicly state which specific funds were cut, or give a reason.

Other Trump administration battles with elite universities have reached some resolutions: Columbia settled, a federal judge found the funding freeze at Harvard unconstitutional, and Northwestern’s president recently announced he will resign.

Will the Duke situation quietly fade, or are more headlines coming?

Clearing my cache

It’s 919 Day in the Triangle, as today’s date matches our main area code. NC State’s Centennial Campus will host a free concert to celebrate.

Data center update: Statesville City Council unanimously approved a five-building data center campus, despite some local opposition.

The production company behind YouTuber/candy bar magnate MrBeast’s Amazon game show received a maximum $15 million state incentive to shoot portions of the next season near Wilmington and Greenville. MrBeast grew up in Greenville and maintains a studio in the Eastern North Carolina city.

Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese will step down at the end of the month, meaning Duke Health and UNC Health each face top leadership changes amid a turbulent funding landscape.

Acadia Healthcare is shutting Carolina House, three treatment center facilities near South Durham that address eating disorders and general behavioral health. The closure comes as Acadia faces both federal investigations into its general admissions practices and Medicaid cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill.

A new annual report from NCInnovation shows the imperiled statewide economic development organization awarded UNC System researchers $18.8 million between June 2024 and June 2025. Melanoma treatment, lithium purification and power-grid efficiency were among the recipient projects’ aims.

North Carolina has issued a permit to Duke Energy to install 13 new emergency generators to support Novo Nordisk’s large, expanding pharmaceutical plant in Johnston County.

RTI International laid off around 120 staff members on Thursday as the Durham-based global research nonprofit continues to readjust to the federal funding climate. “RTI’s next chapter will demand bold thinking and strategic agility,” RTI CEO Tim Gabel said in a statement.

National Tech Happenings

Trump officials and Chinese leaders have outlined a deal to transfer TikTok to U.S. control. At least one Raleigh grandmother should be thrilled.

The Federal Reserve cut rates his week in an 11-to-1 vote and suggested two more cuts could come before year’s end.

Amazon says it will invest $1 billion to raise pay and lower health care costs for its U.S. transportation and fulfillment workers to more than $23 an hour.

Waymo’s driverless robotaxis are coming to Nashville. How long until Raleigh gets them?

ABC has pulled Jimmy Kimmel off his night-time talk show following complaints from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr over Kimmel’s comments regarding the Charlie Kirk shooting suspect.

An author, scientist and Citizen Potawatomi Nation member, Kimmerer is well known for writing the book “Braiding Sweetgrass” and its follow up “The Serviceberry – The Abundance and Reciprocity in the Natural World.” This second book teaches one on how to orient their life around graditude, reciprocity and community based on the lessons of the natural world.

“She’s a wonderful scholar, activist, writer, very inspiring. Her text is very accessible to a wide community of folks who are wanting to live in greater harmony with the Earth, to be better stewards of the planet and we hope that it can bring a lot of people into greater commitment to this idea of caring for the Earth,” Columbus Interfaith Executive Director and UUCCI minister Nic Cable said.

The theme of this year’s summit is “Strong and Supported,” which Faith in Place development officer and Columbus Interfaith member Eric Riddle said really plays into Kimmerer’s second book. Each session will focus on ways that people can give and receive healing to the Earth as well as ways to create a healthier and more just world.

“We really want to emphasize the importance of circular economies, of seeing ourselves as connected to the natural world and as a humanity that helps all of creation thrive through our support of ecological systems…,” Riddle said.

About 30 in-person watch parties will take place on Sept. 30 across Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin, or Faith in Place’s main service territory, Riddle said. Prior to the watch party, a vegetarian pitch in dinner will be held at 6 p.m., with the live stream starting at 7:30 p.m.

A discussion in Unitarian Universalist’s sanctuary will then take place after the live stream. Riddle said they will also be inviting their guests to more Interfaith events that will be occurring throughout the rest of the year.

“… this is open to anyone. (We) certainly, you know, have a strong Christian attendance, but there’s also members of the Hindu Temple that come from the Islamic Center, people who have a Buddhist spiritual belief system,” Riddle said. “So we’re really just trying to continue that work that’s been going on for a long time.”

From the summit, Cable hopes people walk away with new friendships, connections and commitment to living more consciously and being better stewards for the Earth. He said environmental justice concerns everyone, and in bringing people of different religious backgrounds together, attendees can learn from each other’s religious teachings and perspectives.

“So I think naturally, the gift that having an intentional interfaith group gather for this summit is to be reminded that we are all in this together and that not one religion has all the answers or has all the solutions,” Cable said. “And so we can and need to learn and listen with and from each other so that we can move forward together.”",https://www.therepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AIM_IN_THE_REPUBLIC_32x32-v2.png,N,,2025-09-20 12:02:59.904209

Hancock County Commissioner Bill Spalding posted in a private Facebook group that representatives from Chesco Energy had approached county commissioners about the prospects of building a gas turbine power generation plant in Blue River Township — more specifically, around County Roads 750 East and 200 South, near Pleasant View Cemetery.

The post, originally made in the Facebook group “Eastern Hancock School Happenings,” was copied and posted by other residents and shared across various groups, including the community Facebook group “Westland – Blue River Township Indiana.” Spalding confirmed the veracity of the post to the Daily Reporter. The plan is still in its preliminary stages, and no official proposals have been brought forward.

Chesco Energy started up earlier this year, looking to develop natural gas power projects in states with increasing electrical demand. The company’s website says it is “enabling the energy tradition” and meeting the challenge in the surge of electricity demand driven by generative AI and data centers. Chesco hopes to create a balanced and reliable power grid backed by thermal and renewable energy.

“While renewables are an important component of a sustainable future, the evolving market dynamics underscore the essential role of hybrid power facilities — combining both battery technology and thermal generation to ensure grid reliability and support the smooth integration of renewables and meeting increasing electricity demand,” the company’s website says.

Company leaders have previously worked in various major energy companies, including Duke Energy, NRG, Washington Group International and Exelon.

According to federal data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas made up 40.5% of the utility-scale electricity generation in Indiana for 2024, which is second of all power generation in the state, only behind coal. The nearest natural gas power stations are one operated by Duke Energy in Henry County and one operated by Indiana Municipal Power Agency in Anderson.

Representatives from Chesco recently presented plans, Spalding said in his post, which include evaluating several sites across Indiana with proximity to gas and power utility crossings and the ability to secure a location by only talking to a minimal amount of homeowners.

One of the landowners in the general area Chesco is targeting is Tyner Pond Farm. Opened in 2010 to implement regenerative farming practices and raising chicken in pasture environments, the farm has grown since its opening. Owner and founder Chris Baggott said if a plant was built in the area, it would disrupt the biosphere and the environment Tyner Pond Farm has created over the past 15 years.

He said the food system is moving toward localization, and that maintaining the agricultural land on the eastern side of the county needs to be an important priority for county officials.

“People think this isn’t going to be disruptive, but it will be very disruptive for operations. It’s all about soil health, microbiology and the healthy biosystem that allows our cattle to be healthy, without having to have drugs, without having to have vaccines, antibiotics, etc.,” Baggott said.

In his Facebook post, Spalding said one major concern of the proposed development is the proposed height of the vent stacks, which could go up to 200 feet tall. For comparison, the Hancock County Courthouse is 181 feet tall.

“Additionally, this plant is intended as a pass-through facility, meaning it would not provide power to the local community, nor would it bring substantial employment (an estimated 50 jobs at most),” Spalding said in his post.

Blue River Township Trustee Brandon Jones said he first heard about the potential plans for the area about a month ago from local farmers. He said he then told Spalding about the potential development in the township.

Jones, elected trustee for the largely rural township in 2022, said he did not see the benefit of a potential power generation plant in the county if it wasn’t going to directly benefit the county.

“I understand that progress is going to happen. I don’t like the idea of it being in the backyard,” he said. “I don’t see how it’s going to benefit Hancock County, period, let alone people from Blue River Township.”

In his online post, Spalding said once Chesco reached out to local landowners to gather their input, it planned to report its findings, and later schedule a public meeting with commissioners to discuss the proposal.

In late 2023, Hancock County approved a new version of the county’s comprehensive plan, which is supposed to be a guide for future growth and development in the county. In the plan, the future land use map shows the area around County Roads 750 East and 200 South recommended for remaining agricultural land.

County commissioners have used the land use map in making crucial decisions about economic development in the county. In July, after several months of public interest, commissioners put an end to considering a proposal to turn 775 acres of agricultural farmland into a data center in Buck Creek Township. One major reason why the commissioners dismissed the proposal is because the area proposed for the development was not an appropriate site for such a project according to the comprehensive plan.

Baggott believes the county will not give Chesco the go-ahead to build in Hancock County, referencing the county’s comprehensive plan. However, he is worried that if county officials reject it, the company could partner with a utility company and petition the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to override the county’s decision.

“That’s a little bit worrisome. I think so far, the government at the state level has been very supportive of county rights of putting appropriate development in appropriate places. Our county has designated spots for this kind of thing,” he said.

Jones noted that Blue River Township does not have the infrastructure necessary to support a power generation plant. He said if the plant was built, the company would need to significantly upgrade the infrastructure in the area. Jones said he would prefer for the area to stay as farmland.

“We also have to consider water and sewer and well. If they need water, they’d have to use a well. If you dig into somebody else’s aquifers, it could mess up other people’s wells in surrounding areas. There’s a lot to consider with that,” he said.

For Baggott, at the end of the day, he just wants to make sure the comprehensive plan is being followed and the eastern third of the county is being kept as rich, fertile agricultural farmland.

“We don’t want to see what we have created destroyed,” he said.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AIM_IN_DAILY_REPORTER_32x32-v2.png,N,,2025-09-20 06:58:27.057269

Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) emerged in the European Union around 2010 as a framework to align science and technology with societal values, ethical standards, and sustainability goals [1]. While the United States does not formally use the term “RRI,” its principles are embedded in many federal regulations and oversight mechanisms.

Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) offices are at the center of this work. By ensuring compliance with standards from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other agencies involved with the work environment, EHS teams translate RRI’s high-level principles into day-to-day practices [2] [3] [6] [7]. Their work protects research personnel, the public, animals, and the environment while fostering trust in scientific progress.

The Purpose of Responsible Research

At its core, responsible research emphasizes ethics, sustainability, and accountability. RRI was formalized in European policy through Horizon 2020 and focuses on aligning research outcomes with societal needs through engagement, governance, and foresight [1]. Recent scholarship highlights a “decoupling dilemma,” where the concept of inclusion risks being used as a broad impact measure rather than staying anchored in equity and justice for marginalized groups [2].

In the U.S., responsibility is embedded not through a single RRI framework, but through a patchwork of regulatory standards, compliance obligations, and ethical codes. EHS offices play a central role in uniting these requirements. Their work includes:

Identifying hazards and assessing risk levels [4].

Implementing controls to minimize risks to people and the environment.

Supporting oversight committees like Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).

Ensuring alignment with best-practice laboratory standards such as Prudent Practices in the Laboratory [5].

In this way, EHS teams embody the purpose of responsible research while ensuring that discovery and innovation occur without compromising health, safety, or public trust.

EHS Across the Research Lifecycle

Research Design: Building Safety into Proposals

EHS involvement begins before the first experiment. During research planning, EHS staff conduct hazard assessments, evaluate containment needs, waste stream, and review risk management strategies. Their findings support oversight committees such as IBCs, which review recombinant and synthetic nucleic acid research [8], and IACUCs, which evaluate the humane use of animals [9].

By embedding safety and ethics into protocols early, EHS helps ensure that projects not only meet regulatory requirements but also reflect RRI principles of anticipation and governance. This proactive approach saves time, resources, and reputational risk later in the research process.

Research Execution: Training, Monitoring, and Compliance

Once a study begins, EHS responsibilities expand to include:

Training research staff on hazard awareness and protective practices [4].

Monitoring laboratories for compliance with OSHA standards, such as those addressing chemical hazards, biological risks, and ionizing radiation [4] [7].

Managing hazardous materials and waste to reduce risks of environmental contamination [5].

Coordinating with EPA programs, such as Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), which tie safe laboratory operations directly to the credibility and reliability of submitted data [6].

Through these measures, EHS ensures that compliance is not just a bureaucratic requirement but a foundation for valid, trustworthy, and ethically defensible research.

Ongoing Monitoring: Continuous Improvement and Accountability

EHS engagement does not stop once research is underway. Offices conduct audits, inspections, and corrective action tracking to identify gaps and ensure that hazards are managed over time [2].

In radiation-related research, for example, OSHA’s ionizing radiation standards set dose limits for workers, require personal monitoring (such as dosimeters), and mandate hazard postings [7]. Similarly, NRC requirements for radioactive materials and OSHA rules for non-NRC sources establish a multilayered system of protections.

This continuous monitoring embodies the RRI principle of reflexivity by assessing whether current practices align with both regulatory expectations and societal values.

Oversight Committees: IBC, IACUC, and Beyond

Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs)

NIH guidelines require IBCs at institutions conducting recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research. These committees ensure containment, monitor compliance, and evaluate risks to researchers and the community [8]. EHS offices provide critical expertise, aligning laboratory practices with biosafety protocols and serving as liaisons between researchers and regulators.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs)

IACUCs oversee programs of animal care and use, including protocol review, semiannual evaluations, and facility inspections [9]. EHS staff collaborate with IACUCs to implement occupational health and safety programs, ensure staff are appropriately trained, and support disaster preparedness plans that safeguard both animals and personnel.

AAALAC International Accreditation

Beyond federally mandated committees, voluntary accreditation through AAALAC International provides institutions with a benchmark of excellence. AAALAC uses three primary standards—the NRC’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Ag Guide, and the European Convention on Vertebrate Animals—as well as position statements and guidance documents to evaluate programs [10]. Institutions that pursue AAALAC accreditation demonstrate their commitment to global best practices and the values of RRI.

Societal Relevance: Beyond Compliance to Stewardship

Responsible research is not only about protecting laboratory staff, it is about upholding public trust and protecting ecosystems. EHS offices help institutions demonstrate their commitment to transparency, accountability, and sustainability.

Examples include:

Real-time monitoring systems for air and water quality in laboratories and surrounding communities [5].

Occupational health programs that protect not only employees but also the families and communities connected to them [9].

Integration of sustainability practices, such as energy-efficient laboratories and responsible waste management, that minimize research’s environmental footprint.

In doing so, EHS bridges the gap between compliance and stewardship. This aligns with RRI’s call to anticipate long-term societal impacts and to ensure that science is conducted with both responsibility and foresight [1,2].

EHS as a Foundation of Responsible Research

Environmental Health and Safety offices are more than compliance checkpoints, they are enablers of responsible innovation. By embedding safety and ethics into project design, execution, and monitoring, EHS teams ensure that research progresses without compromising human health, animal welfare, or environmental integrity.

Through collaboration with oversight committees, alignment with OSHA, EPA, and NRC standards, and integration of best practices like Prudent Practices and AAALAC accreditation, EHS translates RRI principles into daily operations. Their work protects not only laboratories but also the communities and ecosystems touched by science.

Ultimately, EHS fosters the trust, transparency, and accountability that make research both innovative and responsible.

There have been lots of tragedies in Texas,” DeMatthews said.

We know that the state is seeing a severe shortage of teachers, and now, we’re seeing educators being fired or resigning, like the president of Texas A&M.

Spectrum News talked with Dave DeMatthews, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, to get his perspective on this and other issues facing Texas educators today.

DeMatthews talked of the recent focus from the Texas Education Administration (TEA) on comments made in the classroom at every level about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an issue that has caused controversy across the country.

“TEA just a few days ago put out a directive to superintendents across the state who may have made inappropriate comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk. And, you know, this is kind of arbitrary. There have been lots of controversial issues. There have been lots of tragedies in Texas,” DeMatthews said.

“But the kind of bigger concern is the long term. Rather than the TEA focusing on its job, and it’s not always been effective at its job, right? Rather than doing that job, or ensuring there’s a quality teacher workforce, now they’re distracted on another issue. And that’s a big concern,” he said.

He emphasizes that, in such an environment, it’s going to be hard to get people to want to teach, which is already a problem in the state.

“Who’s going to want to be a teacher in this sort of hostile political environment?” he said.

On the subject of free speech, which has been at the center of the debate in recent days, DeMatthews issues an ominous warning.

“It harkens back to the Red Scare of the 1940s and 1950s,” he said, referring to the McCarthy political hearings on communism. “We should be at a point in our society where we’ve learned from our history’s past mistakes.”

Those on the other side of the issue point to the right of an employer to have their own rules and policies governing what they consider to be appropriate behavior. DeMatthews doesn’t see an inconsistency in that viewpoint.

“Just to be clear, teachers do have an educator code of conduct, and having a code of conduct and engaging professionally and ethically is really important, especially since we’re trusting teachers to work with children in our public schools,” he said.

“But that does not necessarily provide the government the right to go scouring and searching for private conversations and private posts that are made by teachers. And the same goes in the workforce,” he added.

And what of legislators such as Briscoe Cain, who took to X this week to say, “We must drive the woke out of our institutions?”

“All I would say is I wish our legislators, our elected officials, our commissioner had the same code of conduct that teachers had, and that the same standards were applied to them,” he said. “But that is not the case.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UT_Austin_generic,N,,2025-09-20 12:02:42.668926

Adding a household array is a great way to reduce or even eliminate your utility bill, as well as cut harmful, plant-warming air pollution. The fumes are linked by experts to greater chances for severe heat waves and droughts that are impacting even our food supply through feared farm labor productivity loss and crop damage.

EnergySage is a great resource to help you get started. The free tool compares quotes and can aid your search for the right professional installer in your area.

The Solar Energy Industries Association reported that there are more than five million installations in the United States, most of them on rooftops. A government report said that 1.2 million Americans claimed tax incentives for solar and other clean energy upgrades on their 2023 tax returns.

Unfortunately, most of the incentives are sunsetting early, along with other household rebates. But WKAR's story said that solar credits for business and nonprofit projects last into 2026 and 2027, per Phelps.

""There is a little bit of a larger window,"" he said in the story.

EnergySage's guidance can make sure you collect all applicable rebates, saving you up to $10,000. There's also a helpful mapping tool that compares costs by state, as well as localized incentives. What's more, EnergySage can help you upgrade elsewhere around the house. Its experts have great advice for efficient heat pumps, for example. It's an HVAC switch that the government said can reduce home electricity use for heating by up to 75%. The units also provide energy-efficient air conditioning and can operate in almost any climate.

Fast action is important to secure residential project incentives — including up to $2,000 in tax breaks for heat pumps — before they expire at the end of the year.

OAK RIDGE, Tenn., Sept. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Type One Energy announced Friday that TVA has issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Type One Energy regarding the utility's interest in the potential deployment of Type One Energy's fusion power plant technology at its former Bull Run Fossil site once it is commercially ready.

Infinity Two is a first-generation 350 MWe baseload power plant utilizing Type One Energy's stellarator fusion technology. The stellarator is currently the only fusion technology to have demonstrated stable, steady-state operation with high efficiency, characteristics which are important for TVA and others in the industry who need to reliably generate on-demand power at competitive prices. Type One Energy is developing Infinity Two using today's existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support near-term deployment of the technology. The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce.

""TVA is a leader in pursuing advanced nuclear technologies we need to power America's economic prosperity and fuel artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing,"" said Don Moul, TVA President and CEO. ""We are strategically partnering with innovative companies like Type One Energy to advance the development of nuclear technologies, and I am excited about the possibility of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion power plant being built in the Tennessee Valley. Our region is building a nuclear ecosystem that provides good jobs and opportunities for the people of the Valley.""

TVA is at the forefront of advanced nuclear innovation, and this collaboration reinforces the agency's commitment to quickly deliver reliable energy to support the nation's growing power demand.

""We are really honored to be working with TVA on the world's first private sector fusion power plant project,"" said Christofer Mowry, Type One Energy's CEO. ""TVA is a best-in-class energy utility that knows how to build, operate, and maintain complex power generation technologies. This LOI with TVA, and the role it establishes for Type One Energy as the fusion technology provider for their Infinity Two project, is therefore fully aligned with our goal of pursuing the lowest-risk approach to commercializing fusion energy.""

"" Tennessee is ready-made to lead America's energy independence, and today's announcement further strengthens our position as a leader in safe, clean, and reliable energy,"" said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. ""We are proud that the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion project could be developed in Oak Ridge, creating high-quality jobs and driving continued economic growth and opportunity for Tennesseans.""

Final decisions and definitive agreements regarding the funding and construction of Infinity Two, as well as any agreements to purchase the energy output, are subject to TVA Board approval, regulatory review, and alignment with TVA's least-cost planning processes and American energy dominance strategy.

The New South Wales Government is fast-tracking the State’s first REZ, aiming to upgrade existing grid infrastructure such as distribution poles and wires. This approach will help reduce the impact on communities and the environment.

“Planning approval for the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone project is further evidence of progress on a key upgrade that will help the lights on as coal-fired power plants retire.

“Upgrading existing distribution poles and wires allows us to minimise the impact on communities and the environment, and speeds up the delivery of this critical infrastructure,” Minister for Climate Change and Energy Penny Sharpe said.

“This important milestone in the development of the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone project is good news for communities in the Central Coast and Hunter.

“The REZ will help ensure a reliable and sustainable energy future for our regions,” Minister for Central Coast David Harris said.

The Hunter-Central Coast REZ development is proposed to include:

Upgrades to 85 kilometres of existing sub-transmission power lines

Building two new energy hubs (substations)

Upgrading two existing energy hubs (substations)

Installing 18 kilometres of new underground fibre optic communications cable

The network infrastructure upgrades will run from Kurri Kurri to Muswellbrook, and it will enable about 1GW of network transfer capacity.

“The Hunter-Central Coast region has always been a powerhouse for industry and innovation and now it’s taking a bold step forward into the clean energy future.

“Fast-tracking the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone is about more than just new poles and substations, it’s about delivering affordable, long-lasting energy while creating good jobs, supporting local businesses and protecting our communities and environment.

“By upgrading existing infrastructure, we’re minimising disruption, maximising benefits and ensuring our local communities are at the heart of the state’s renewable transformation,” Minister for the Hunter Yasmin Catley said.

Projects such as the Hunter-Central Coast REZ are key to the State Government’s energy plan. Currently, about 36 per cent of New South Wales’ electricity comes from renewable sources.

Full planning approval was granted following the exhibition of the Review of Environmental Factors as well as a review of submissions by councils, state authorities, businesses and individuals.

With most of the works proposed to take place on existing easements, the Hunter-Central Coast REZ network infrastructure was assessed to have a relatively low environmental impact.

Ausgrid is partnering with EnergyCo to deliver the network infrastructure upgrades. Ausgrid is committed to addressing the feedback on the Review of Environmental Factors, which included priorities like jobs, support for local businesses and procurement, protection of visual amenity and environment, community benefits, effective traffic management and ongoing community engagement.

This REZ development is anticipated to create an average of about 590 direct jobs annually in the local area during its construction phase. Opportunities include roles for engineers, electricians and labourers. Ausgrid is committed to prioritising jobs and skills training, local procurement and Aboriginal business participation.

The Hunter-Central Coast RES development is now subject to final approvals from the Australian Energy Regulator.

This project, however, is separate from the Hunter Transmission Project Environmental Impact Statement currently on public exhibition.

“Fast tracking the Hunter-Central Coast Renewable Energy Zone project is part of EnergyCo’s plan to keep the lights on for everyone in New South Wales, while providing tangible benefits to Hunter communities and their economies,” EnergyCo Chief Executive Hannah McCoughey said.

“Finalising the Review of Environmental Factors marks a significant milestone toward delivering upgraded network infrastructure that supports clean, reliable energy for the Hunter-Central Coast region.

“Ausgrid is committed to working closely with landowners and local stakeholders as we enable a lower cost transition that reduces the impact on our communities,” Ausgrid CEO Marc England said.",https://www.felix.net/hubfs/Felix%20Project%20News/Header%20images/hunter-central-coast-renewable-energy-zone-nsw.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 10:00:28.514463

We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone.
What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat?
Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change?
The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance.","How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

‘When it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.’

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

our island

up to

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

up

at the world.

In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home.

Anjal Prakash, the director of research at the Indian School of Business' Bharti Institute of Public Policy, told the South China Morning Post, ""India has ambitious goals to realise its green energy potential and reduce fossil fuel imports.""

The country is working toward producing and exporting billions of dollars of hydrogen energy. Shripad Naik, minister of state for power and new and renewable energy, shared that the goal is ""to make India not only a major producer but also a global hub for green hydrogen export.""

If realized, this wouldn't just be good for the planet, but also India's economy. Already, India has handed out dozens of contracts to production and manufacturing companies.

However, there are still challenges. India also needs to develop its infrastructure alongside actually producing the green hydrogen. Storing energy will be essential, but it can be pricey, as the South China Morning Post reported.

""Policy and regulatory frameworks are still evolving, creating uncertainty for investors,"" Prakash told the publication. ""Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for green hydrogen to become a viable and competitive energy carrier.""

India is still committed to reducing its reliance on dirty fuels, though. These fuels produce gases that are warming the planet at an accelerated rate, per the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Policy Uncertainty and Its Impact on EV Adoption

California's 27% share of U.S. EV sales makes it a bellwether for the industryCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ]. The absence of a $7,500 tax credit—a key affordability driver for lower-income buyers—risks stalling progress toward the state's 2035 gasoline vehicle sales ban. According to a report by Bloomberg, the loss of incentives disproportionately affects households earning less than $75,000 annually, who rely on subsidies to offset the higher upfront costs of EVsCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ]. Without state-level rebates, analysts project a 12–15% decline in EV sales in California by mid-2026, which could ripple across the national market given the state's outsized influence on automaker strategiesElectric vehicle tax credits end, impacts California …[ 2 ].

Valuation Pressures on EV Manufacturers

The policy vacuum has already begun to erode investor confidence. Tesla's stock, for instance, has fallen nearly 50% from its December 2024 peak, reflecting broader market pessimism about near-term demandEV Stocks Are Falling Today: What's Going On?[ 5 ].

and , both of which have historically relied on California's regulatory tailwinds, have seen similar declines. Data from Forbes indicates that the removal of tax credits, combined with proposed 25% tariffs on imported EV components, has exacerbated production cost pressures, forcing automakers to reassess capital allocation2 Top Undervalued EV Stocks to Watch Now[ 3 ].

Yet, not all automakers are equally vulnerable. Rivian, for example, remains the most resilient among North American EV startups, with production ramping up and a clearer path to profitability compared to peers like Lucid or Mullen AutomotiveCalifornia EV Tax Credit Replacement Faces Funding Uncertainty[ 4 ]. This divergence highlights the importance of operational efficiency and diversified revenue streams in navigating policy-driven headwinds.

Supply Chain Dynamics and Resilient Segments

The EV supply chain is facing its own perfect storm. Tariffs on Chinese battery components and geopolitical tensions have driven up costs, but domestic and FTA-aligned battery material producers are emerging as bright spots. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has spurred over $49 billion in U.S. battery manufacturing investments, creating a buffer against global supply shortagesCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ]. Companies producing electrolyte salts and separators—critical but undersupplied components—are particularly well-positioned to benefit from this trendCalifornia Won’t Replace Expiring $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit[ 1 ].

For investors, undervalued segments within the supply chain are worth exploring.

These firms, which supply sensors and microchips essential for autonomous driving and energy management, are less exposed to direct policy shifts than automakers themselves.

Strategic Entry Points and Risks

While the near-term outlook is clouded, long-term fundamentals for EV adoption remain intact. Battery prices have plummeted from $400 to $111 per kWh since 2024, and technological advancements in solid-state batteries could further reduce costsElectric vehicle tax credits end, impacts California …[ 2 ]. For investors willing to weather short-term volatility, strategic entry points exist in:

1. Battery material producers aligned with IRA incentives.

2. Semiconductor firms with EV-specific expertise.

3. Automakers with diversified portfolios and strong balance sheets (e.g., Rivian).

However, risks persist. Global shortages of lithium, nickel, and cobalt could delay production timelines, while a potential second Trump administration's trade policies may deepen supply chain disruptions2 Top Undervalued EV Stocks to Watch Now[ 3 ].

Conclusion

California's decision to abandon a state-level EV tax credit is a pivotal moment for the industry. While the immediate impact on sales and valuations is undeniable, the long-term shift toward electrification is unlikely to reverse. For investors, the key lies in identifying resilient supply chain segments and automakers with the agility to navigate policy uncertainty.

It's this push to end large-scale energy projects on private property as well that some in the energy industry consider especially troubling.","There are four new solar projects in New York, adding about 27 megawatts to the state’s grid, as the renewable energy source continues to be the cheapest way to bring more capacity online.

The expanded capacity comes online as U.S. energy demand climbs for the first time in decades and the state pursues its goal of 10 gigawatts of distributed solar generation by 2030.

The four projects are part of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze, a Texas-based renewables company, and CS Energy, a New Jersey-based solar and energy storage company.

What are Western, Central New York's new solar projects?

Here are the four projects in western and central New York:

Pavilion, Genesee County: This solar farm on Shepard Road has a capacity of 6.5 megawatts from 12,116 solar panels on 40 acres.

Phelps, Ontario County: This 7.2-megwatt facility on state Route 96 includes 13,390 solar panels on 26 acres.

Fonda, Montgomery County: This facility opened about two months ago with a 7.2-megawatt capacity from 13,365 panels on 21 acres.

The projects were supported by New York State programs such as the Community Adder and Inclusive Community Solar Adder, which supports community solar projects serving low-to-moderate income users.

Four additional projects from the Catalyze and CS Energy partnership, expected to add 25 megawatts to the New York grid, are scheduled for completion in the next year.

Trump administration trying to curtail wind, solar projects

Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the United States and produced as much as 17% of the country’s electricity last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical agency of the Department of Energy.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has paused permits on all new wind and solar projects on public land, onshore and offshore, writes Elizabeth Weise for USA TODAY.

The vast majority of renewable energy projects – 95% – are on private land, according to a report by the Brookings Institution. But many of those require some type of federal approval and are also being stalled by the new rules. It's this push to end large-scale energy projects on private property as well that some in the energy industry consider especially troubling.

“It’s expected that every time you have a major change in administrations, policies on public land might change,"" said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association. “But the willingness of this administration to create political and bureaucratic barriers to private economic activity on private land is something nobody anticipated.”

(P&GJ) — The U.S. Justice Department has entered the legal battle over Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 pipeline, filing a statement of interest in federal court that challenges Michigan’s attempt to shut down the cross-border oil and gas line.

The filing, submitted in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, argues that Michigan overstepped its authority when it sought to terminate Enbridge’s easement for the 645-mile pipeline, which runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac between Lakes Michigan and Huron.

“The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation’s statutory authority,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.”

The Justice Department pointed to the Pipeline Safety Act, which gives the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) sole responsibility for interstate pipeline safety standards. By attempting to enforce its own safety rules, the state infringed on PHMSA’s exclusive federal jurisdiction, the filing said.

The statement also emphasized the international dimension of Line 5, citing the U.S.–Canada treaty governing cross-border pipelines. Federal attorneys argued that Michigan’s actions interfere with U.S. foreign policy and treaty obligations.

The legal dispute dates back to 2020, when Michigan issued a notice to revoke Enbridge’s easement across the Straits, citing safety concerns. Enbridge has since fought to keep the line in service, stressing its importance to U.S. and Canadian energy markets.

Matt FoxBBC News NI

Kilroot power station may need to be given an exemption from environmental rules to help guarantee electricity supplies in Northern Ireland this winter.

It has two gas-fired turbines which are currently restricted to running for 1,500 hours per year.

Outages at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh power stations mean these turbines have already been heavily used this year and are now approaching their annual running time limit, as set by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.

The company which operates the grid said it is working with the regulator and the Department for the Economy (DfE) to ""unlock restrictions to ensure there is sufficient generation"".

Meanwhile, the department told the BBC it is ""prepared to use all levers available to government"" to address the situation.

""The department has been working with several key stakeholders, including the Environment Agency, to ensure mitigations are put in place to maintain security of supply,"" a DfE spokesperson said.

""Security of supply is a key priority,"" the department added, insisting it will continually work closely with the energy industry to ""ensure the resilience of the system"".

'A challenging year'

On Monday, the System Operator NI (SONI) issued a four day-long system alert, warning of a ""heightened risk"" for supply.

The alert was suspended on Friday afternoon, although the operator has said projections highlight the possibility of further alerts this winter.

In a statement, SONI explained that when it issues an alert ""there is no immediate impact for users of electricity"".

Instead, the alert ""warns of a heightened risk for potential temporary electricity supply issues in the near future"", allowing those working in the electricity sector to take ""pre-planned actions to protect the integrity of the grid"".

The operator said it has been a ""challenging year operationally"" with the prolonged outage at Ballylumford due to damage caused by Storm Darragh, alongside a ""significantly extended maintenance outage"" at Coolkeeragh.

These outages have meant that SONI has had to ""rely more heavily"" on Kilroot, however these plants ""are now approaching the current limit of hours these generators can run"", it said.

The operator added it is ""continuing to work closely with power station operators, the Utility Regulator and the Department for Economy to unlock restrictions to ensure there is sufficient generation to meet system needs and consumer demands as we head into the winter peak"".

'Delicately balanced'

Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI's BBC News NI agriculture and environment correspondent

While gas may be greener than oil, it is still a fossil fuel and the limits on how many hours Kilroot can use gas for generating power are there for a good reason.

They've been calculated in line with our greenhouse gas emissions targets, as set within the Climate Change Act and the carbon budgets, so reducing emissions means reducing power output.

The limits may be lifted when the plant converts to a combined cycle gas turbine to capture and utilise the residual heat from burning gas. The plan is for that to happen next year.

But this notification shows how delicately balanced our energy system can be when put under pressure.

It adds to the argument for more locally-sourced, sustainable energy – and storage to have it available for the system.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10c4/live/4101a4c0-95a3-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 04:58:30.869261

The recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act (2025) has shifted some timelines on tax policies, and our expert highlights some provisions that New Hampshire business owners should notice.

Panelist: Dana R. Bull, CPA, MST, Vice President of Tax Services at Mason + Rich, masonrich.com

Q: What regulations should business owners be aware of as it relates to tax planning for 2025 and 2026?

A: The current administration recently passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025. In addition to making permanent many provisions originally set to expire from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2018, the Act also introduces changes that affect deductible expenses and business credits. Here are three changes to take note of.

1) Increased Deductions for Property Purchases

Businesses will benefit from expanded deductions for qualifying property acquired in 2025 and future years, such as:

Bonus Depreciation: A 100% bonus depreciation deduction is available for qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025. For assets placed in service between January 1 and January 19, 2025, the rate is reduced to 40%.

Section 179 Expensing: The Section 179 deduction limit increases from $1,250,000 in 2024 to $2,500,000 for 2025 and beyond, with future amounts indexed for inflation. Unlike bonus depreciation, these deductions are typically limited to a business’s net income.

State Consideration: New Hampshire does not allow bonus depreciation and caps Section 179 expensing at $500,000.

2) Research and Experimentation (R&E) Costs

The Act also brings favorable changes for research-based businesses. Beginning in 2025, R&E costs can once again be fully deducted in the year incurred. This reverses the prior requirement (effective 2022–2024) that R&E costs be capitalized and amortized over five years. Eligible small business taxpayers may amend prior-year returns to claim the full deduction for R&E costs for tax returns filed for 2022, 2023 and 2024.

3) Changes to Clean Energy Incentives

Not all provisions were taxpayer-friendly. The Act accelerates the phase-out of certain clean energy credits. The Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit is now set to expire on September 30, 2025 (previously December 31, 2032). Businesses planning to claim this credit must ensure qualifying vehicles are purchased and placed in service by that date.

Q: What are the key takeaways businesses should consider with these tax law changes?

A: Businesses should review their capital investment and research and experimentation (R&E) strategies in light of the new provisions, while also noting the shortened timelines for clean energy incentives. State-specific differences, such as New Hampshire’s unique rules, must be factored into planning. There are additional provisions not addressed here due to space constraints. Because the legislation was enacted quickly, the Treasury Department and IRS are still in the process of issuing detailed guidance on many provisions.

As Skor recounted, Growth Energy is the largest biofuel trade association in the country, with a network of 130 companies, including John Deere and BASF, and nearly 100 biorefineries, such as ADM, Cargill, and POET.

“So there’s a very strong connection to some of the real big priorities that are really important to this administration,” Skor explained.

As Skor recounted, Growth Energy is the largest biofuel trade association in the country, with a network of 130 companies, including John Deere and BASF, and nearly 100 biorefineries, such as ADM, Cargill, and POET. These operations span 33 states, with a particular presence in the Midwest. “We are really the engine of the rural economy,” Skor said. “It goes back to the fact that we help keep small communities going and thriving.”

The conversation emphasized the enduring popularity and legislative success of biofuels in the U.S., with the industry offering value to both political parties. On the one hand, they provide low-carbon energy and decarbonized modes of transportation. On the other, they produce affordable and accessible fuel, contributing to both energy independence and dominance. This bipartisan support was most evident in the budget reconciliation bill that was signed into law earlier this year. Although it cut $545 billion in tax credits that originated in the prior administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, Congress extended and even enhanced the technology-neutral clean fuel production credit, Section 45Z.

Biofuels have emerged as a point of alignment between the Trump administration and the clean energy industry. For example, during President Trump’s first term, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increased access to higher blends of ethanol. In this term, the president issued an executive order on day one directing the EPA to consider higher-ethanol blend E15. “So there’s a very strong connection to some of the real big priorities that are really important to this administration,” Skor explained.

Skor stated that this support stems from both the President’s loyalty to the U.S. farmer and his emphasis on ‘America First.’ “The administration is making these announcements through the framework of US agriculture and maintaining strong biofuel demand,” she summarized.

Meanwhile, the industry is seeing significant opportunities arise in both the short and long term. On the near horizon, argued Skor, the continued use of ethanol in cars and trucks in the U.S. and abroad is a particular highlight. Domestically, this has recently been spurred by the highest-volume requirements ever proposed by the EPA under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Even California, until now the last state to cap the amount of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline at 10 percent, saw its Senate vote unanimously to allow the sale of E15. Internationally, Canada, Brazil, India, Japan, and Vietnam are also increasing their goals and standards regarding ethanol, providing a market opportunity.

In the longer term, meanwhile, Skor pointed out that a significant amount of innovation is emerging in this space. For example, sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to transform the aviation industry. At the same time, ethanol can replace bunker fuel in the maritime sector and replace diesel in long-haul trucking. In these nascent markets, Skor commented, “We still have to be able to do, for some of them, proof of concept. We’ve got to get regulations in place. We’ve got to be able to produce a commercial scale and get the economics in line. But that’s the blue sky potential.” As these technologies further decarbonize through carbon capture, the application of climate-smart agricultural techniques, and the installation of more clean energy sources, the carbon intensity of these fuels will also continue to decrease.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/549877374_1227743092726280_3947920055023475192_n-1-e1758291202320.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 03:58:12.493984

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Good morning everyone. Good morning. First of all, go Bills — I'm back Upstate. I can say that.

First of all, to Heather, leadership truly matters in all operations entities, government, certainly, but an organization like this where you have such credibility with your partners in government, it really makes a difference when you come to us. It's reasonable, it's well thought out. It is researched and I'm always proud we can find a pass together. And you were a very loud proponent and champion for the state to do something rather unprecedented, which is to dive into our reserves.

When I first became Governor, our reserves were about four percent. I had worked on 14 local government budgets and I knew that my Budget Director in the town of Hamburg always said we need to be about 15 percent. So, I kept building and building the reserves to get us to about an excess of 15 percent. And in so doing it gave me a chance to use that to do a one-time infusion of money to pay off the unemployment insurance debt that was born on the backs of our employers. And when I looked at some of the bills that they were paying based on the number of employees and how much it was adding up, whether you're a small business or large, I said, “If there's one pro-business thing I can do, that'll have a massive impact across the state, it is eliminating this.” But Heather, I want to thank you and congratulate you on working so hard to get that over the finish line.

I know we have some representatives from the REDC. Marsha Gordon is here, the Co-Chair of the Mid-Hudson Regional Economic Development Council, and, of course, head of the Business Council of Westchester. And I know we have a number of elected officials in the room — John McDonald, Gary Warner, and Assemblymember Rivera — is still, or did you leave? You leave on me? Okay. Go Bills, there you go.

But I also know that you've been a little busy with the report. My team made sure I dissected it and read your analysis because I'm always looking for input from all perspectives and certainly the business perspective on what businesses like in New York is the most important to me to hear and to learn from. And I will say it talks about our strengths and it certainly points out the weaknesses, which I am very cognizant of.

You know my own family story, talk about how my dad worked at the steel plant, and struggled. I lived in Lackawanna, but eventually I talked about how he got a college degree. And over years having that credential allowed him to do something quite extraordinary when a few young guys talked to him about joining a company that was only a year old back in 1968. It was something known as a computer services company. How rare was that in Buffalo in 1968. So, my dad took the plunge at age 30 with five of his six little kids. And people at Bethlehem Steel thought he was crazy — that certainly they would go out of business and they did struggle. We had a lot of lean years, but eventually grew into a powerhouse of computer task group. And I know there's many clients in this room. Because as a little kid, I used to go on the client calls. I went and visited Corning and Eastman Kodak and went around the state trying to just get business for him. So, you need to know in my heart there's a very pro-business understanding and appreciation for the risks that's involved and how the winds of change affect you, whether it's out of Washington or tariffs and statewide policies.

And so, I'm very cognizant of that when I look at bills that people are encouraging me to pass. I also say, what is the impact on whomever, but always business as well when I think it's going to have a — what is the impact? Are they involved? Do they have an alternative? Is there something else we can do to get to a position that is going to help our business and not hurt them. So, my philosophy has always been not just from my experience with my own failings, but also my siblings became serial entrepreneurs. They started businesses after businesses, and I was involved in serving as legal counsel to some of them. And so, I know what the regulations are, like I know what the stress is — like I know how to complain about the government, like every business does. But also now that I'm in government in a meaningful way, My job is to also make your jobs easier. You deserve to have a government that's on your side, not on your back. And that's what I'm going to continue fostering for the next many years in government.

So, you've heard some of the economic impact from Blake, I presume. He's my Budget Director because he tells me how the winds are going and sometimes even though he looks like he's perpetually happy and optimistic, I could see the clouds a little bit. And we certainly felt a lot of clouds and saw clouds across his face and indeed our state after July 4th when the dubbed Big Beautiful Bill that I can only call, the Big Ugly Bill was passed because Blake knew that was going to be a huge financial hit on us — what Washington did, and healthcare being in the line of fire number one.

It is a $13.5 billion hit to healthcare systems with the loss of Medicaid subsidies. The State of New York lost $7.5 billion in subsidies like that. We have to make up $3 billion next year, even just this year, midyear — figure out how to come up with the loss of $750 million. So, we have been working intensely on how to do this with minimal pain to people who've come to rely on these services.

We've had more than our share coming our way unanticipated out of Washington and that takes up a lot of my staff’s time and effort. But, we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. But also, I've charged my staff with finding ways to streamline government. You need to know that's important to me. We don't need excessive government. We don't need excessive programs.

You saw how I took on the CDPAP program. That was a program that was built to provide people to be able to select their own home care provider if they had health problems or debilitating situations — makes all the sense in the world until it's abused. And we had ended up with 700 providers, these financial intermediaries in between the patient and the provider; whereas a state like California with double our population somehow managed to do it all with one financial intermediary. And as a result of this excess and explosive growth in this middleman position, we went from a $1.5 billion program to an $11.5 billion program with the same size population basically except there ended up being so much abuse and we've had many cases brought where the fraud and the waste and abuse. People charging the State of New York for reimbursement when they actually live in Florida or saying that they're helping their grandmother and working 24 hours a day living in her house and charging the state. It was an abuse and I was warned there's going to be a lot of pushback if you try to change that, but I cannot knowingly be the Governor of the State and know that there's programs like that are so wildly expensive. When you look at what the drivers of our Budget, by far it is the Medicaid costs and the healthcare costs and education, and those are set.

Last year, we started our budgeting Medicaid — went up 12 percent before we even opened up the books, we want to get it right, we want to make sure we take care of people, but make sure that anytime we're aware of abuse, we are going to fight it and fight hard because you are ultimately the ones paying for that.

So, I'm trying to look at programs like that and others where we can have substantial savings. This first year, you're saving $500 million from what we did by streamlining that and getting it down to one provider despite massive opposition to those changes. And so I'm looking for more ideas like that, and I'm sure many of you out there see them. I'm on the verge of hiring a top-notch professional to oversee an office that's going to look at regulatory opportunities. I think, is Bob Duffy here? Bob Duffy, something. If you're standing here, I can't — oh, Bob, great to see you again. And I always harken back to the work that you did as Lieutenant Governor and making a real difference in trying to uncover this. But I want to make sure that I get it over the finish line. That's not just identifying areas where we can streamline regulations, but also get it done.

And I just use one example: the seeker process. You heard me talk about this the first year. I said, we need to build more housing in this state. I have to have more housing, whether I'm in the North Country and we have a lot of hospitality businesses, the hotels, the restaurants, people are driving an hour and a half to go to their jobs because they can't afford housing anywhere near these communities. Long Island — same thing out at the East End or other parts. I was just out there meeting supervisors out there. They're starting to finally see that. I've been talking about this for years and I'm right. We need to build more housing for our workforce. And that'll be a great lift for employers in Central New York. I just looked at some modular homes there that we're looking to expand. They look like gorgeous homes by the way, you cannot tell the difference because I have 50,000 jobs coming to Central New York with Micron. So, all across the state, the demand is only growing. But there's barriers and I've tried to take this on and we want to, right now in the process of streamlining our seeker rules, the environmental review process, which I know from my local government days was always the way you could say no to somebody, right? I know how to say yes, I know how to say no. I had 14 years of going over local applications for business development and housing projects. So, I know exactly what it's all about. And so, I just want to make it easier. Let's build more housing, get rid of some of those rules, or at least streamline them and make them common sense.

So, I put out the offer here today. Help us identify areas, and I'll never compromise the health and safety of New Yorkers. So if you've got something that removes the restriction that does that, don't waste my time. But if you have something, it's time has passed, it's obsolete, it's duplicative, it's redundant — bring it to us so we can actually have a thoughtful conversation about this. And I'm trying to expand not just housing, but I also have to expand our energy capabilities intensely. You wouldn't believe the interest in our state now that we successfully landed Micron, and what an accomplishment that was — “People are still talking about how you landed Micron.”

I said, “it’s a secret, I don't want other states to know.”

But a lot of it was personal engagement and showcasing how extraordinary New York is and what a great place it is. You'll find an incredibly dedicated, hardworking workforce for you. But also the university system we have, the feeder system, our community colleges — all this plays into creating an environment that is hospitable for business. But then, if they don't have the energy to power what they're doing, then they have to go somewhere else. So I've taken that on as a personal challenge to me, because I want to get this right and give us all the advantages when it comes to recruiting businesses and helping our businesses here expand.

So, I look at nuclear. Now, you don't hear that out of the mouths of a lot of Democratic Governors, but you should. It's a renewable source. It's clean energy. And I look at what happened when a project was shut down Downstate, Indian Point was shut down a few years ago, I'm the one who inherited that and the decommissioning. We lost 25 percent of the power that was going to New York City without a Plan B. So now, we have more trucks, diesel trucks, transporting liquefied natural gas and home heating oil over the roads. And guess what? Guess how emissions have gone up Downstate because of that one move. So I'm looking at the possibilities, opportunities for nuclear.

Back in June, I had a major press conference putting NYPA in charge of finding a place to do this and getting it going. And we already have four nuclear reactors, three sites in Upstate New York. And after I announced it, you would not believe the number of communities that came knocking on my door, “Can we have it in our community?” I won't send it Downstate because that's fine with me, I don't need a battle, but Upstate wants this because they want to power the industries that are coming, whether it's Edwards Vacuum, another supply chain element that we were able to recruit with 600 jobs after the Micron announcement. There's so many great things happening.

I was just up here. Last week, Micro Bird, we were about to lose Nova Bus, big employer up near Plattsburgh. And we were able to find a company from Quebec that is now — despite them being real unhappy with our country. And I had to do a little smoothing over there that New York really loves Canada, “We're not going to try and take you over. So you're safe and we'll forgive what you did in the war of 1812.” But I digress. Buffalo was burned to the ground. But I forget all that. But when we were able to land this opportunity to bring in a company from Quebec to take over that facility, not one employee missed a beat. They went from the fear of losing their jobs, 350 people, good-paying manufacturing jobs, about to lose them. And we structured a deal to say one day you're working for Nova, the next day you're working for Micro Bird and you miss nothing in between. And I was so proud to see we were able to accomplish it.

That's just one example of where I get very involved, but also know that I can do more to promote businesses Upstate and Downstate as well.

But if I can get the power, if I can get nuclear going, if I can reduce some of the regulations associated with that — and I've had conversations with Washington about this. I told the President I need to have more of an all of the above approach to our energy solutions. I need you to leave offshore wind alone, because Empire Wind would power — it's 1,500 jobs — half a million homes in Brooklyn powered by clean offshore wind energy. Next year we're expecting it, then it was shut down like that. So we've had to have some conversations. The President knows I'm all in for nuclear. We're working closely on that to reduce some of their regulatory timeframe as well.

So, once we get this underway, focus on hydro and all of our other opportunities, my friends. There's no holding us back, because we have a world-class, educated workforce. We're going to continue this. You saw what we did with community colleges in response to employers saying that they need more employees that would have skills, we identified some industry sectors where there were shortages of workers. You know this one, it's health care. We have a huge shortage of health care workers. But also advanced manufacturing, the trades, clean energy as well as semiconductor manufacturing. So we are providing free community college education to any adult age 25 to 55 who will go back to school and maybe never entertained those fields and never could do it because of the cost. We're covering the cost of their community college education where they can now step into a four year institution. Just by announcing this months ago, we have 16,000 students who are now going to community college. And they’re learning skills that are going to be beneficial to all of you as employers. That's how we create the synergy we need between our workforce and our institutions as well as your workplace.

I'm working on housing, working on energy, working on workforce development, more recruiting, infrastructure projects — I love building things. We're just going gangbusters; creating tens of thousands of jobs for anybody from Downstate, New York City.

I look at something like the bus station, the Midtown Bus Terminal. Have you ever been in there? Stay away. It's scary. But it's going to be gorgeous. It's a $10 billion project, 6,000 jobs. But these are the kind of projects that — and Penn Station, people go by them year after year and just assume it always has to be that way, it always has to look like that. I believe in the preeminence of New York State and how we must showcase ourselves in a proud way where our infrastructure, our airports and our transportation hubs really gleam and look welcoming and magnificent and should be talked about.

And so, I'm on the cusp of more announcements along those lines, but every one of the projects — the Gateway Tunnel, that was locked up for years because governors couldn't get along and the President wouldn't get along and there’s all this, forget that, we have 10,000 jobs right there alone. So I'm all about creating jobs and opportunities and affordability as well.

You've told me to talk about affordability, number one issue, in addition to public safety. And I just hosted a law enforcement reception at the Governor's residence this morning — that's where I came from — honoring police officers and people in law enforcement, public safety all around the state, letting them know we believe in them. I have their backs because they have ours. We'll always overfund them or fund them dramatically, $3 billion we've put into law enforcement.

And my friends, share this statistic. The numbers of crimes are declining extraordinarily. Going down dramatically. I'll just put it that way, going down dramatically. And we are at lows. Whether it was the lowest crimes on the subway, July and August, in recorded history, some of the lowest murder rates in history, now we're starting to record them. I've been all over Upstate helping with law enforcement grants to help our local governments. And it's making a real difference.

We never rest on our laurels. We're not done. More to do. But I'm telling you, compared to when I was first elected Governor, the numbers are staggering, heading in the right direction. I'm really proud of that. That's foundational. No matter where your workplace is, your employees need to feel safe getting there. So we’re taking care of that. We focus on that.

As I mentioned, we have to get them housing. We have to get them reliable infrastructure to get to their housing. We have to make sure that we're making these investments. But in the long term, I just, at a high level, want to make sure that all of you are proud to be in New York. And I'm here to say thank you. I know some of you're even being recruited to other states. Say no, okay? Just say no. Remember that slogan from First Lady Reagan? Say no. Stay here. We’ve got a Governor who's going to look out for us and make sure that we thrive. And that is my commitment to you because when you're doing well, when you're hiring, when you're expanding that is a very good trajectory for New York.

And again, even our growth numbers in jobs, we have added 800,000 new jobs — private sector jobs. Everyone says, “Oh, you're hiring in government jobs,” — private sector jobs since I became Governor. And our rate of growth is achieving the numbers where I'm satisfied, but not quite there yet.

I could go over a whole list of other projects. They're exciting, and I'm proud of them, but know that I'm going to keep standing with you year after year and telling you that we are not done yet. We're going to make sure that not only are you proud to be here, because I'm proud to have you here, that the rest of the country sees this and they're really starting to.

I'll close with one more thought because I find this one of the most exciting. What we have done in putting New York on the map as a tech hub, the word is out. I was at the Economic Club speaking yesterday. And it's not just Micron. Not just Micron. But it is what we're doing with artificial intelligence. Now, there's a lot of fear associated with this, and it is a disruptive technology, but it is here and we can either embrace it or condemn it. And I say we embrace it because whoever harnesses the power of AI today will own the next generations of power. And I want that to happen here. And it is happening here.

I launched Empire AI. People were like, “What are you talking about?” And I want to thank the legislators for having the faith, when this first came to you for support, that we could invest State dollars leveraged with private sector dollars, leveraged with powering our universities all together and create the nation's largest supercomputer dedicated to public good and research. Largest in the nation outside a private company. Guess what? It's no longer a dream. It's a $500 million investment and is already at the University at Buffalo. And I didn't just do that as a hometown call. The power up there is plentiful with the hydroelectric power and I had plenty of space. But it is not just for Buffalo, it is for the entire state. And that's the beauty of this.

And we have more people, more Ph.D. candidates, more faculty — I was out there last weekend — faculty members who came from California because they heard about this because they will have, at their fingertips, power that is not available anywhere else in the nation. And what are they doing with this? They're solving society's problems and health challenges and doing research and devising new therapies. Work that would've taken months and months to do, they can do in hours. And you know what? As great as that sounds we're just about to launch, that was Alpha-Beta, 11 times faster than that.

So, that leads me to say that this is putting us on the map. In California, my friends in Silicon Valley are saying they wish their Governor had done this because we are the first in the nation to pay attention. And literally yesterday, I had a company that talked to me about a $50 billion AI investment in Upstate New York. So stay tuned.

But this is the scale that I'm talking about. And that may not be your industry, but it may power some facet of your industry someday. And you're going to want that. And this is going to give you the competitive edge against everybody else. And that's my job as Governor, to make sure that we have all the advantages. We know what we have. We know how great we are. But when we're competing with the rest of the world in other states, we have to have tangible attractions to bring them here. And that's exactly what I'm focused on.

So, thank you very much for listening. Thank you for believing in New York State. And again, very proud of your Governor. Thank you, everybody.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-09/BusinessCouncilHero.jpg?h=851b5d7e&itok=1bnyBKld,N,,2025-09-20 14:00:44.965904

Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) would be tasked with developing proposals that prioritize these projects and submitting them to FERC.

Grid operators would further need to demonstrate why specific projects should move forward more quickly and explain how those projects improve grid reliability or resilience. They would also have to invite public comment before filing proposals and regularly report to FERC on the impacts to grid stability.

The legislation comes amid concerns that the U.S. electric grid is unprepared for surging demand from data centers, new manufacturing and widespread electrification. Generation projects, many of them renewable energy, remain stalled in record-long interconnection backlogs.

Nuclear microreactors, by contrast, could sit on land the size of a football field and power a whole town.

However, after decades of fraught relationships between the nuclear industry and communities in many parts of the U.S., building these tiny reactors requires reckoning with the complex history of nuclear technology and rebuilding public trust.

Microreactor technology for use in towns or cities hasn’t been developed yet, but many researchers have been building the case for its use.

For example, this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.

I’m a nuclear engineer who has been exploring nuclear microreactors’ potential. My research and teaching focuses on some of the questions that would come with placing miniature nuclear reactors close to where people live.

Microreactors: A history

Nuclear microreactors as a technology are both new and old. In the 1940s and ’50s, the American military and government began developing small reactors and nuclear batteries to power submarines and spacecraft.

After developing these small-scale reactors and batteries for various missions, the nuclear industry’s focus shifted to power reactors. They began to rapidly scale up their designs from producing tens of megawatts to the gigawatt-scale systems common around the world today.

These historical reactors were small because scientists were still learning about the physics and engineering underlying these systems. Today, engineers are deliberately designing microreactors to be small.

Microreactors aren’t to be confused with small modular reactors – these are often scaled-down, modularized versions of large reactors. Small, modular reactors can be built as single units or in clusters to achieve the same capacity as a full-size reactor. Microreactors would be smaller than these, with a power capacity under 20 megawatts.

Manufacturing and cost

Because they’re small, microreactors wouldn’t require a massive, multiyear construction project like large nuclear power reactors. Several units could be assembled in a factory each year and shipped off to their final destinations in a truck or on a barge.

Large reactors are not inherently flawed – in many ways, they remain the more economic nuclear energy option. However, electric utility companies have recently hesitated to invest in large reactors because of the multibillion-dollar nature of these projects.

Microreactors require a different but equally significant kind of investment. Though individual units will have a significantly lower price tag, building a factory to produce these microreactors is a massive undertaking. Reactor companies are waiting for their order books to fill up before investing in factories.

It’s a catch-22. Without orders, technology developers are unlikely to build microreactor factories. And future users of these new reactors are unlikely to place orders until this new style of production has been tested and the initial units built.

Future users are also waiting to see what the microreactors will actually cost. Reactor developers have put forward many cost estimates, but in the past, estimates for nuclear reactors haven’t always been reliable. Developers likely won’t know the true numbers until the reactors are actually built.

Initial “first of a kind” units will undoubtedly cost significantly more than later units. As manufacturers learn the best production processes, they’ll be able to make more reactors for less.

In this paradoxical situation in which developers are waiting for orders and users are waiting to see the economics of initial reactors, government funding for building demonstration projects could help usher microreactor technology from early designs to the market.

First movers such as national laboratories, universities, data centers and military bases that are willing to buy these initial reactors also have a role to play in validating the economic feasibility of these new reactors.

Today’s microreactors

In a nuclear reactor, the combination of nuclear fuel and coolant – which is the substance used to both cool the fuel and transport the heat generated by it – used in its design determines what situations it will work best in. Many nonwater coolants can allow reactors to operate at lower pressures, which is a little more safe.

The microreactors being developed today are based on a wide range of reactor technologies and make use of many different combinations of nuclear fuels and coolants.

Some reactors, such as the submarine propulsion reactors, are small, pressurized water reactors – the same basic technology used in most large-scale nuclear power plants. Others use configurations that resemble the small reactors in spacecraft. Still others make use of nuclear fuel and coolant combinations previously attempted in much larger reactors, such as high-temperature gas reactors, sodium fast reactors and even molten salt reactors.

Though encompassing a range of technologies, microreactors are all significantly simpler than the large reactors in use today. In many cases, they have few to no moving parts.

Microreactors, by virtue of being significantly simpler, are going to be more knowable. Because they’re easier to study and understand, simpler reactor systems have fewer points of failure and safety concerns.

Complex systems, such as the large nuclear power reactors, can be fundamentally unknowable, with unexpected entanglements of “unknown unknowns” creating instabilities, safety concerns and potential for failure. Large reactors operate safely today because we have learned about these unknown unknowns over decades of operation. Microreactors, because of their simplicity, will fundamentally be safer and more predictable than the large reactors were when they were first built.

Siting microreactors

Although the Department of Energy oversees microreactor demonstration projects, commercial deployment of microreactors requires approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could take several years and may ultimately determine how soon commercial reactors can be built. Several designs are now approaching or in the early stages of review.

To keep people safe, large reactors have designated emergency planning zones – usually 10 and 50 miles around – which require different degrees of planning and protection to enter. The 10-mile zone has specific shelters and evacuation plans in place, while people in the 50-mile zone may need to take precautions about what they eat and drink in the event of a catastrophic accident but will not need to evacuate.

Because microreactors are smaller and simpler, developers and regulators may significantly reduce their emergency planning zones. The zones could extend only to the facility’s site boundary, or perhaps a few hundred meters beyond it.

A reduced emergency planning zone could mean that microreactors could be built in towns and cities, or embedded in remote communities. They might one day become as ubiquitous as the solar panels and windmills you see when driving through the countryside. And like the submarine reactors that can power a small underwater community of 100, one microreactor could power a rural town.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?

Public engagement

My lab’s ongoing research suggests that the answer to this question is contingent on how technology developers engage with the communities that may host a microreactor. If they attempt to unilaterally decide, announce and defend their decision to build a microreactor without input, communities will likely push back.

However, if developers work with communities to understand their hopes, concerns and priorities, they will likely find that many people are receptive to hyperlocal nuclear energy facilities.

My team’s initial findings suggest that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach for designing these facilities. Each community will have its own set of preferences that developers will need to navigate alongside the engineering questions.

In our discussions with community members in southeast Michigan, my research team has seen interest in designing these small energy facilities as a feature of the community that’s easily accessible to local residents. Community members designing hypothetical microreactor facilities with us have proposed shared spaces, recreational facilities, onsite visitor centers or science museums, and public art projects. Instead of hiding these facilities out of sight, they want these places to be inviting and beautiful.

CALIFORNIA POLICY IS ALWAYS CHANGING: Know your next move.","With help from Alex Nieves and Camille von Kaenel

GREEN UNION ENERGY: Close your eyes and think of the power players you’d expect to be pushing state leaders on California climate policy. Are you imagining the autoworkers union? No. But you should be.

The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America sponsored SB 787, a bill on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk that would require a slew of state agencies to collaborate on building out the supply chain for clean energy industries including zero emission vehicles and their batteries, offshore wind energy and heat pumps.

Conventional thinking says UAW is a surprising sponsor for a renewable energy bill, but Mike Miller, the union’s region six director, doesn’t agree. Miller, who represents over 120,000 members across California and eight other western states, sees himself as part of a long lineage of environmentalist labor leaders. He described climate change as “the signature challenge of our time” in an August UAW report.

UAW is a very different union than the coalition that emerged from the Detroit auto plants in the 1930s. Today, the organization represents workers in local governments, hospitals, nonprofits, and universities. Miller himself came to UAW through academia, cutting his teeth organizing fellow teaching assistants at UCLA in the 1990s.

We spoke with Miller to learn why the labor leader decided to throw the heft of his union behind environmental reforms, and how he thinks the effort will benefit his members in the end.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Where did the idea come from for SB 787?

Well, the majority of our membership believes climate change is a crisis, and we need to move far more aggressively to tackle that crisis. You know, manufacturing is also in the DNA of the UAW. We need to find a way to thread these two goals together.

Industrial policy also is a historic core of who the UAW is, whether it was meeting manufacturing needs during World War Two or bolstering the post war boom. We’ve always believed it’s necessary for working people to engage in industrial policy.

So we decided about two years ago that we needed to take this seriously. We worked with some outstanding academics and working people to develop a vision for growing the clean industrial economy in California through policy.

Manufacturing has been on a long term decline since the late 80s. In California, we’ve lost close to a million manufacturing jobs in a variety of industrial sectors. It’s important that we grow these jobs back.

We really believe in and support California’s decarbonization goals. Climate change is a huge crisis, and one that we need to address quickly.

We think that one of the best ways to have the collective political will to make that happen is to have a strategic industrial policy that creates good middle class manufacturing jobs in the sectors of the economy that need to decarbonize, like batteries, building decarbonization, heat pumps, industries like that, offshore wind.

Can you share more about how you came to this moment of having climate change issues be such a major focus for you?

Hurricane Katrina, I mean you could go on and on.

I talked a little bit about the UAW’s DNA. UAW helped found Earth Day. And [former UAW president] Walter Reuther and after him Doug Fraser, I’ve seen quotes of them, and I’ll get these wrong, but I can paraphrase them, testifying before Congress: ‘What good does it do to to make more money, make enough money to go on vacation, if the lake you’re going to go on vacation to is polluted? What good does it do to have more time off if the air where you live is too polluted to breathe?’

So we’ve always understood the connection between the environment we live in and the environment we work in. And so it’s been an issue for us for a long time. I think that the stark climate crises that you see, and things like the wildfires in LA this year, really helped drive that home and make it a more pressing, salient issue.

Would you describe yourself as an environmentalist?

Yes.

I’m struck that if the policy works out the way you’re hoping for, it would benefit workers, but presumably it would also benefit people who are running companies, people in the management and investor class. Why is it that UAW sees it as part of its responsibility to help shepherd along policies that also help this investor class and management class?

You have to have a thriving business, a profitable business, to have a workforce. Auto companies where the auto workers work have to make profits to give pay increases to the workers.

The fight isn’t about the success of the company. The workers are often very invested in the success of the company, very proud of the cars and buses and trucks that they build. The fight is over what the workers rights in the workplace are.

That takes a number of forms: The right not to be harassed, the right not be bullied, the right to leave work in the same way that you came in, to work in a safe environment, to have control over your schedule, to have time off to spend with your family, to have paid parental leave, paid sick leave, and to share the profits of the company. The conflict in the collective bargaining process is negotiating over who controls production and in whose interest and who profits from the work that is done at the company. And we’re squarely on the side of the workers playing a very decisive role in all of those processes. — NB

ENERGY CARE PACKAGE: Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the sweeping package of bills Friday to boost oil drilling, rescue wildfire-threatened utilities and extend the state’s cap-and-trade program.

The package, which came together in a last-minute agreement after weeks of negotiations with lawmakers, represents a compromise between increasing fossil fuel extraction in an effort to stave off in-state refinery closures and continuing to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions.

“We’ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals, and so this lays it out, but it lays it out without laying tracks over folks,” Newsom said, against a backdrop of towering redwood trees projected on the screen of a planetarium in a San Francisco science museum. “We set the tone and pace for the rest of the nation.”

The legislature’s focus on energy emerged in January as leaders promised to tackle affordability, which gained even more political urgency as wildfires and refinery closures raised the threat of higher electricity and gasoline costs. Two of the bills, which allow California utilities to join a West-wide energy market and increase oil drilling in Kern County, garnered Republican votes.

The renewal of the state’s carbon market, which Newsom committed to after President Donald Trump threatened to dismantle state climate laws in April, gives the governor a climate win at a time when the state is losing other core pieces of its climate strategy, like its mandated phase-out of new gas-powered cars by 2035. And the package includes a spending plan for roughly $4 billion in annual cap-and-trade revenues, including $1 billion in guaranteed yearly funding for the state’s controversial high-speed rail project.

Utilities will also benefit from an $18 billion boost to the state’s wildfire fund, a pot funded by utility company shareholders and ratepayers to help pay wildfire-related claims. And the final piece of the package will strengthen air quality monitoring in communities disproportionately impacted by pollution. — CvK, NB, AN

WHERE’S THE REBATE?: Newsom is retreating on his commitment to restart a state rebate program for EV buyers to backfill the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit.

Just minutes after signing the energy package, Newsom acknowledged at a press conference that the state “can’t make up” for the Biden-era incentive that the Trump administration will end on Sept. 30.

The announcement comes after Newsom said last November that he would propose creating a new version of a state rebate program if Republicans went after federal incentives. California ended its broad rebate program in 2023 and replaced it with a system focused on low-income drivers in certain disadvantaged communities.

“We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits, but we can continue to make the unprecedented investments in infrastructure, which we’re doing,” he said.

Prior to Newsom’s announcement Friday, five car manufacturers — Audi, Honda, Hyundai, Rivian and Volkswagen — had called on the governor and legislative leaders to create a $5,000 rebate program that would last until July 1, 2028. Under the terms proposed by the companies, cars priced up to $55,000 and trucks and SUVs up to $80,000 would be eligible for the rebate.

And state agencies released a joint list of recommendations for supporting the EV market last month, including “point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other credits” to backfill the expiring federal tax incentives. — AN

(Lane is chair of the West Virginia Public Service Commission)","The Public Service Commission of West Virginia has been at the forefront of discussions on the importance of having a reliable energy source for this nation.

While never downplaying the importance of all fuels, we consistently advocate for having energy that doesn’t falter when there’s no wind or no sun shining.

We’ve found that coal and natural gas, both abundant in the Mountain State, are reliable sources for powering electric generation plants.

In support of this idea, the administration in Washington declared a national energy emergency soon after it came into office.

As part of that initiative, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced it would fast-track approval for projects involving coal, gas, oil, and minerals on public lands. (May 30, 2025)

As a result, environmental reviews of permits that previously took a year to complete could be done in as few as two weeks.

More complicated environmental impact statements that usually take two years to complete could be done in four weeks.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum says the federal government intends to cut through unnecessary delays so it can fast-track the development of American energy and critical minerals.

And the administration has taken steps under the emergency declaration to promote fossil fuels in particular.

Just recently, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the scope of environmental review on some major energy projects under the National Environmental Policy Act. (May 31, 2025)

This law requires an agency to produce an environmental impact statement that must address significant effects expected to be caused by a project, and to suggest alternative ways of making a lesser impact.

In its unanimous ruling, the nation’s highest court reversed an appeals court decision.

The appeals court said the agency should have broadened its study to include environmental effects upstream and downstream of the project. The Supreme Court reversed that finding.

The court also said citizens could not use the courts to challenge the environmental effects beyond the immediate project at hand.

This decision is in line with the administration’s concern for energy independence and our use of fossil fuels to power this nation.

It remains important to all of us, as the demand for electric power continues to grow in this country, that we continue to have a reliable source for that energy.

These two matters should help us on the way to energy independence.

The EPA administrator has welcomed the new approach to the energy sector in the United States","The EPA, or Environmental Protection Agency, has withdrawn the proposed coal-ash changes for the sector and reopened the sector to potential rulemaking changes that the EPA is hoping to wrap up as quickly as possible. In 2015, the EPA published its findings from an extensive study into CCRs(coal combustion residuals), commonly known as coal ash, from coal-fired power plants. Those findings enabled the EPA to establish new rules for the disposal of coal ash from coal-powered plants across the United States. However, the EPA is following a new directive championed by the Trump administration’s new approach to the energy sector in America.

The Environmental Protection Agency has made several changes to the rules around CCRs

When the EPA published its new direct final rules, the proposal was met with the warm embrace of the companies and individuals operating in the coal sector in the United States. It states that the rule is a direct result of the extensive study done into the effects of coal ash on the environment and public health. The direct final rule establishes technical requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments under subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA.

That RCRA is the primary rule set for operators in the coal sector in the United States. However, following a new ruling by the EPA, that direct rule is now going to feature some significant changes, thanks in no small part to the efforts of the Trump administration. The new policies and executive orders implemented by Donald Trump aim at increasing the standing of the energy sector in the United States by easing regulations and providing more flexibility for owners and operators in the energy sector.

The EPA proposes a significant change to the two-part Facility Evaluation Report

The two-part Facility Evaluation Report is essential to establish certain requirements for coal mine operators in the United States. Under the Biden administration, the Facility Evaluation Report, or FER, was split into two phases. Which took up valuable time and resources that cost the operators and eventually the public vast amounts of taxpayer dollars.

The proposed change comes in the two-phase FER process that companies and operators are forced to endure. Under the new EPA guidelines, championed by the Trump administration, the FER process can be completed simultaneously, instead of the traditional two-part process it currently uses. FER part 1 requires the operator to conduct a ” review of readily and reasonably available records regarding where CCR was either routinely and systematically placed on land, or where facility activities otherwise resulted in measurable accumulations of CCR on land.

FER part 2 requires on-the-ground testing. And under the old rules, those two reports were to be submitted separately. The proposed rule change would allow companies to merge FER Part 1 and FER Part 2 into a single submission, due on February 8, 2027. It is not the first action taken by the EPA to align with the new administration’s approach to the energy sector.

There are also some discontinued models, like the Chevy Bolt and BMW i3, out there.

Now, the list above is not really a perfect list for used EVs you can get the $4,000 tax credit to help buy. The car you’re buying has to cost $25,000 or less, and it has to be a 2023 or earlier model year — many of the models above can’t be had for $25,000 or less, and several models didn’t come to market until after 2023.

Four models I think could be especially appealing for getting the $4,000 used EV tax credit include the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Volkswagen ID.4. (There are also far more Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3 vehicles on the market, of course, if you want to go the Tesla route.)

Kia EV6

Carfax shows several used Kia EV6s for under $20,000, and many more for just over $20,000. Naturally, there are typically reasons for why the cheapest options are so cheap — high mileage, a branded title, an accident history, etc. Sometimes it pays off to spend just a little bit more to get the best deal. The above model was still priced at just $20,415 before the $4,000 tax credit. Not too shabby!

Ford Mustang Mach-E

There are numerous Ford Mustang Mach-Es available for under $20,000, but watch out for high mileage or other features. Above is one appealing one I found — just about $20,000, under 50,000 miles, 2023 model year.

Hyundai IONIQ 5

Similar to the models above, the IONIQ 5 is a crossover that hits the sweet spot of comfortable passenger space, good range, and price. There are a bunch of options near the $15,000 mark, or you can get a vehicle without too many miles on it for around $20,000–25,000. The option above stood out to me as a good buy.

Volkswagen ID.4

Last but not least, we have the Volkswagen ID.4. Many of the same points noted above about the other models apply to the Volkswagen ID.4 as well. However, you can go even further and get an ID.4 for just over $10,000 if you are brave enough to buy a vehicle with high mileage or a branded title. To me, this car looks like a great steal: $16,000, 61,000 miles, 2021 model year.

Leading VPP providers, utilities, OEMs, industry think-tanks and non-profits are forming working groups, partnerships and consortiums advancing interoperability in the VPP market.
If the incremental cost of developing and adopting standardized interoperability protocols exceeds its value, VPP platforms and OEMs will not advance tech agnostic platforms.
Advice for utilities Emergence of a technology agnostic VPP market will take place incrementally over many years.","The virtual power plant market today is fragmented and inefficient, dominated by technology-specific programs and operating platforms that lack interoperability. As a result, neither the market nor individual VPP providers have achieved significant economies of scale.

The majority of VPPs include single distributed energy resource technologies, such as smart thermostats or commercial battery energy storage systems, and limit participation to a handful of original equipment manufacturers.

Though some providers have developed largely tech-agnostic VPP platforms through APIs, interoperability hurdles can cause latency and connectivity issues. While open protocols are emerging, a small fraction of original equipment manufacturers today employ interoperability standards that would allow their products to communicate seamlessly with a range of VPP and distributed energy resource management systems, or DERMS.

As a result, distributed resource owners and operators face limited opportunities for VPP participation. In fact, fewer than 1 in 5 MW of installed DER capacity is enrolled in VPPs today, meaning the potential of DERs remains largely unrealized.

This evolution in the VPP market towards open protocols and interoperability is unfolding against the backdrop of an energy system under tremendous strain. Industrial on-shoring, AI-fueled data center expansion, and transportation electrification are some of the forces shaping today’s energy landscape, contributing to unprecedented load growth and capacity constraints that threaten to overwhelm the system. Now, more than ever, we need to unlock sources of additional capacity on the grid — and load flexibility through tech-agnostic VPPs holds out significant potential to help meet this challenge.

The future is tech agnostic

We believe the future of VPPs is tech agnostic, and a key driver is interoperability.

Interoperability is crucial for deploying certain consumer technologies efficiently at scale. The evolution of EV charging towards interoperability provides an analog to the VPP market.

For EV charging networks to grow and scale effectively, they need to serve a broad range of electric vehicles, and vice-versa — EV charge ports must integrate with a variety of charging stations enabling drivers to reliably get from point A to point B.

In much the same way, virtual power plants must foster cross-technology participation by a variety of DERs and brands to compete with traditional power plants in providing firm, dispatchable power at scale to utilities and wholesale energy markets.

DER manufacturers, in turn, must adopt protocols facilitating communication and integration with a wider set of VPP and DERMS technologies (non-wire alternatives) to augment traditional generation assets and offset costly transmission and distribution investments by utilities and network operators.

Our confidence in a tech agnostic future for VPPs is grounded in economics. In a market populated by single technology programs, some VPP providers will adapt to integrate multiple technology types in order to capture additional market share. On the flip side, a profitable deviation for OEMs is to begin offering DER products that enable participation across multiple VPP platforms, enhancing their appeal to consumers and increasing market share.

This back-and-forth interplay between OEMs and VPPs will move the market towards a tech agnostic state. The transition, however, will not include all VPP providers. It will look different in the short term versus the long run, and may take different forms based on regional, macroeconomic, and regulatory factors.

Sources of variability

While cross-technology VPPs may be dominant five years from now, it is unlikely the market will be uniformly tech agnostic.

Differences in business strategy, technological capabilities, OEM partnerships, customer enrollment models, market share and name recognition will push VPP companies in different directions as they adapt to an increasingly tech-agnostic marketplace. Name-brand OEMs and installers, with in-house VPP technologies and exclusive partnerships, may cordon off their corners of the market, strengthening bilateral agreements with partners and utilities and working to deepen proprietary moats. These VPP providers are less likely to advance the cause of universal interconnectivity.

By contrast, DER aggregators whose business models are built on cross-technology enrollment through non-exclusive partnerships and OEM integrations will champion open protocols and adoption of interoperability standards. Leading VPP providers, utilities, OEMs, industry think-tanks and non-profits are forming working groups, partnerships and consortiums advancing interoperability in the VPP market.

Electric Power Research Institute and Kraken’s Mercury Consortium, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ IEEE 2030.5 DER interconnection standard, Rocky Mountain Institute’s VP3 consortium, Duke Energy’s Open Field Message Bus (OpenFMB) and Linux Foundation’s open source microgrid initiative are examples of this movement towards technology agnostic tools and platforms built around interoperability.

In order for a tech-agnostic market to emerge, VPP platforms and DERs must both adopt open protocols facilitating cross-technology enrollment and interoperability, which will take years. Even once most new DER technologies adopt open protocols, the bulk of legacy DERs on the system will not be fully interoperable. VPP companies leveraging legacy APIs to integrate a variety of DER technologies will play an important role bridging the gap between today’s fleet of non-interoperable assets and the tech-agnostic future market.

Ultimately, regional differences in energy markets, utility governance, clean energy regulation, taxation and economic incentives will largely determine where VPPs take hold and how well they scale. As a result, there are limits to the scalability of VPPs in the US, even as they evolve to be tech-agnostic.

Read More in Grid Security & Reliability

New regulatory policy by states or regulators could accelerate the evolution of tech-agnostic VPPs in certain states or regions by requiring the adoption of open protocols for systems communication and integration, or by mandating utility-sponsored, tech-agnostic VPP programs for customers. Meanwhile, the extension or expiration of tax incentives favoring VPP development could sustain or slow the growth and scaling of VPPs by state or region.

Too big to fail?

It is worth considering what factors could cause the market to remain fragmented and proprietary, rather than evolving towards standardization and interconnection. In other words, what could keep the market from becoming tech agnostic?

If the incremental cost of developing and adopting standardized interoperability protocols exceeds its value, VPP platforms and OEMs will not advance tech agnostic platforms. Given the magnitude and urgency of demand growth by data centers and hyperscalers, the value of additional capacity is increasing rapidly. As utilities begin to face capacity shortfalls resulting from AI-driven load growth, the value of firm, dispatchable resources will rise.

Against this backdrop, and given the sheer volume of untapped DER resources sitting on the grid, the market potential of tech-agnostic VPP platforms likely outweighs the cost. In effect, consumers, aggregators and utilities are leaving money on the table by not connecting these devices to VPPs — an opportunity they cannot afford to ignore.

Advice for utilities

Emergence of a technology agnostic VPP market will take place incrementally over many years. This provides utilities with the advantage of foresight, and the opportunity to prepare in advance for an optimized, tech-agnostic, grid-to-grid-edge future state. There are several steps utilities can take:

Incremental progress is good. Utilities do not have to accomplish everything at once in the transition to unified, tech-agnostic VPPs. An incremental approach is optimal given the nascent, rapidly evolving nature of the market. As an example, utilities will benefit from working with tech-agnostic VPP aggregators and program providers leveraging product-specific APIs for integration today, rather than waiting for the emergence of market-wide interoperability. Through partnerships with today’s emerging tech agnostic VPP providers, utilities can enroll a broader set of existing customer-sited DERs in the near-term, increasing MW under management and learning how to integrate these resources into existing utility systems optimally.

Single-technology VPPs are valuable. Utilities should not shy away from proprietary, single-technology VPPs in the near-term, while waiting for interoperable DER technologies and VPP platforms to mature. Single product VPP providers are dominant in today’s market and are valuable partners in enrolling more DER resources, providing utilities valuable load flexibility experience and learning opportunities, and engaging the customers they will need to operate tech-agnostic grid to-grid-edge dynamic systems in the future.

Foundational systems are key. Utilities must begin working now to implement the systems that will enable them to derive full value from tech-agnostic VPPs. It is important to begin trials, testing and implementation of DERMS, ADMS and other supporting systems that will lay the foundation for their participation in tech agnostic, utility-scale VPPs in the future.

The states with the highest growth in clean energy jobs overall last year were Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, Florida and New Jersey.

More than 80 per cent of all new energy sector jobs in 2024 were in clean energy, the study found.

""What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,"" E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said in a statement. ""Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk - and with it, our overall economy.""

The study analyzes employment in industries including renewable electricity generation, biofuels, electric vehicles, energy efficiency, battery storage and grid modernization.

The analysis does not account for changes in US policy since President Donald Trump took office in January. Since then, his administration has taken a string of measures to unravel federal support for wind and solar projects that were championed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and instead promoted fossil fuels.

The number of Americans employed in clean energy exceeds those employed by oil, gas and coal by three to one, E2 said.

The states with the most jobs in wind and solar include California, Texas, Florida, New York and Massachusetts, according to the report.

Energy efficiency jobs, which include installing efficient heating, cooling and lighting systems and manufacturing certified appliances account for nearly 2.4 million of total sector employment.

Industry leaders must design tangible strategies that align with core manufacturing processes while avoiding superficial efforts that may lead to accusations of greenwashing.

At Sustainability LIVE: Climate Week NYC 2025, the CSO Strategy Summit gathers pioneers from across the manufacturing landscape to share insights on effective sustainability integration.

Attending this event provides an opportunity to glean valuable information about successful methodologies and forward-looking initiatives.

Adapting to an evolving risk landscape

The manufacturing industry faces a rapidly transforming risk landscape, with shifting regulations and increased scrutiny on sustainability practices.

As noted by the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Global Risks Report, environmental challenges such as extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse pose significant concerns for long-term manufacturing sustainability.

Additionally, while 72% of businesses involve their top governance in ESG reporting, a larger impact must extend deeply into manufacturing supply chains, where the majority of emissions are generated.

For manufacturers, addressing these challenges is crucial, not only to mitigate risks but also to capitalise on growth opportunities by integrating environmental considerations into business practices.

Boston Consulting Group highlights that some sectors face upstream carbon liabilities exceeding US$335bn.

Such liabilities underscore the importance of addressing Scope 3 emissions, which can greatly surpass the emissions from direct operations.

Targeting transformation in manufacturing

Moving from setting sustainability targets to achieving transformational change in manufacturing requires robust governance frameworks, comprehensive data management and strategic capital allocation.

The UN Global Compact indicates that about 60% of global emissions are tied to supply chains, thereby necessitating strategies that extend throughout the entire manufacturing process, from operations to partners and suppliers.

Immediate and informed action can allow manufacturing firms to not only manage risks but also seize market opportunities.

Integrating sustainable practices into procurement, product development and operational strategies can position companies to better handle market volatility and capture future growth.

According to RepRisk analysis, as the severity of greenwashing incidents evolves, manufacturing entities need to implement robust data governance and oversee claims with strict board governance to maintain credibility.

Furthermore, a joint survey by BCG and CO2 AI reveals that only around 9% of companies extensively report on all emissions Scopes 1, 2 and 3.

This statistic highlights the need for more comprehensive reporting across the manufacturing industry.

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers today delivered his weekly radio address, celebrating National Clean Energy Week in Wisconsin. Gov. Evers proclaimed September 15-19, 2025, as “National Clean Energy Week” across the state, highlighting the importance of building a robust 21st-century clean energy economy in Wisconsin that supports green jobs, bolsters the health of our state, and ensures the clean, sustainable future Wisconsinites deserve. A copy of the governor’s proclamation is available here.

This week, Gov. Evers also announced the release of the 2025 Clean Energy Plan Progress Report, underscoring achievements made over the last year to advance goals established by the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan. The progress report released today details Wisconsin’s advances in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through clean energy sources while also creating thousands of new jobs and lowering energy costs for families across Wisconsin, as well as investing in job training and apprenticeship programs in innovative industries and technologies. During 2025 the Year of the Kid, the progress report also highlights stories of youth-driven initiatives, helping to create a more sustainable future for Wisconsin.

Since Day One, the Evers Administration has been committed to promoting climate resilience and building a clean energy economy in the state. In 2019, in one of his first acts as governor, Gov. Evers joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing nearly 60 percent of the U.S. economy and 55 percent of the U.S. population. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers was appointed a co-chair of the Alliance after being the first governor from the Midwest to join the executive committee, which oversees the strategic direction of the bipartisan coalition of governors.

In addition to joining the Alliance in 2019 Gov. Evers signed Executive Order #38 to create the Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy (OSCE), charging the office with developing the Wisconsin Clean Energy Plan to promote the development and use of clean and renewable energy across the state, advance innovative sustainability solutions that improve the state’s economy and environment, and diversify the resources used to meet the state’s energy needs. The order also established the state’s goal to reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050 and charged the OSCE with ensuring the state is fulfilling the carbon reduction goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Hey there, folks. Governor Tony Evers here.

This week, we’re celebrating National Clean Energy Week across the state to highlight our efforts to build the clean energy future Wisconsin deserves.

Folks, we don’t have to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment and good-paying jobs and economic development—we can and should do both.And a clean energy economy is as much about protecting the health of our communities as it is about protecting the health of our environment.

So, as governor, I’ve made protecting our environment and investing in a clean energy economy to support our 21st-century needs a top priority of my administration since Day One.

We’ve joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, created a Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, and developed our state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan.

We also created the Green Ribbon Commission on Clean Energy and Environmental Innovation and our Green Innovation Fund, and so much more!And I was thrilled to sign legislation to advance the state’s nuclear energy innovation to continue our work towards ensuring Wisconsin has 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Through these efforts, we’re working to lower energy bills for families, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and invest in jobs and apprenticeship training all while building a brighter, healthier, and more prosperous future.

And while leaders in Washington continue to slash and claw back millions of dollars of federal funding for clean energy initiatives across our state, sending us backwards, this work is more important than ever.

Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work, and here in Wisconsin, that’s exactly what we are going to continue to do.

So, happy National Clean Energy Week, Wisconsin, and take care.",https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/WIGOV/2020/03/3252723/wisconsin-twitter_original.png,N,,2025-09-20 00:58:37.729418

Despite these gains, the sector faces headwinds.

The Overlooked Potential of Wind Manufacturing

While battery and solar manufacturing have surged, wind manufacturing has lagged. A 2025 report by the Clean Investment Monitor notes that the U.S. wind sector has seen declining investment, few new project announcements, and limited capacity expansion despite IRA incentives like the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax CreditThe State of US Clean Energy Supply Chains in 2025[ 4 ]. This underperformance suggests a significant undervaluation.

The IRA's tax credits are designed to incentivize domestic production of wind turbines and components, yet the sector has not yet capitalized on these opportunities. This gap could be a strategic entry point for investors, particularly as global demand for wind energy grows. With supply chain bottlenecks easing and permitting reforms streamlining project timelines2025 Energy Predictions: Battery Costs Fall, Energy Storage Booms[ 3 ], the sector is poised for a rebound—if capital flows align with policy intent.

Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Underfunded Sectors

Not all clean tech infrastructure is created equal. While battery storage and solar remain robust, other areas like industrial decarbonization and utility-scale solar have shown volatility. In Q1 2025, U.S. industrial decarbonization investment plummeted to $79 million from $16 billion in Q1 2024Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ], while utility-scale solar and storage investment declined by 15.4% year-over-yearClean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. These fluctuations highlight the importance of sector-specific due diligence.

However, the development pipeline remains strong, with $328 billion in clean energy projects in the worksClean Investment Monitor: Q1 2025 Update[ 5 ]. Investors who focus on undervalued niches—such as wind manufacturing or regional battery storage projects—can capitalize on mispriced assets while contributing to a diversified energy transition.

Conclusion: Strategic Allocation in a Fragmented Market

The energy transition is not a monolith. While some sectors are overhyped, others are undervalued, offering asymmetric risk-reward profiles. Battery storage's resilience, wind manufacturing's untapped potential, and the IRA's long-term tailwinds suggest that investors who adopt a nuanced, sector-specific approach will outperform in the coming years. As the global infrastructure market continues to evolve, the key to success lies in identifying where capital is scarce—and where it is most needed.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758325485178.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-19 21:59:51.230147

Markey (D-Mass.), U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), and 36 of their Congressional colleagues have submitted an amicus brief to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of Climate United Fund, et al. v. Citibank, N.A. et al, urging the reinstatement of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) grants.

The lawmakers pressed the Court to grant a rehearing en banc, or hearing of the full active bench, and to overturn the erroneous ruling issued earlier this month by a three-judge panel of the Court. That poorly reasoned ruling allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to proceed with its efforts to illegally claw back GGRF awards that were appropriated by Congress and fully disbursed into private bank accounts. The GGRF is a $27 billion national climate financing network that facilitates investments in affordable clean energy deployment to spur economic development, lower energy costs, and reduce pollution. It was passed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and is based on the National Climate Bank Act, legislation authored by Senators Van Hollen and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).

In the brief, the lawmakers argue that the D.C. Circuit panel’s two-judge majority – both Trump appointees – misapplied precedent and ignored the district court’s well-supported factual findings in a results-oriented bid to greenlight EPA’s unlawful efforts to claw back GGRF funds. Given that Congress mandated that the GGRF funds be spent as appropriated, and the funds were already distributed to private bank accounts, EPA’s cancellation of the program is clear executive overreach. The lawmakers stress that letting this decision stand jeopardizes Constitutional protections of the separation of powers, and would amount to a transfer of Congress’ power of the purse to the executive branch.

The lawmakers outlined the thorough, transparent process by which the EPA under the Biden Administration awarded GGRF funds, writing, “Congress passed the IRA in 2022, which authorized and appropriated nearly $20 billion for the GGRF programs at issue here: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA). Congress directed that these funds must be granted to specialized nonprofit financial organizations for projects that ‘reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.’ Congress required that the EPA obligate GGRF funds by September 30, 2024. EPA met the deadline and entered into Financial Agent Agreements to ‘[convey] to the grantees legal title to the award funds’ while ‘affording EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system.’”

“After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations. EPA’s subsequent blanket termination of the NCIF and the CCIA programs willfully ignores Congressional spending power and puts $20 billion of community and clean energy investments at risk. This is not a prosaic contract dispute; this is a constitutional power grab,” they argued.

The lawmakers pointed out that the panel Dalton v. Specter, which disallows judicial review in cases where a statute commits decision-making to the discretion of the President. They argued that Dalton does not apply in this case, writing, “but no statute gave the President, let alone EPA, discretion to terminate all previously obligated and disbursed funds allocated by Congress for two GGRF programs. Plaintiffs’ claims here do not depend on termination of a single contract, withholding of a disputed grant amount, or even administrative interpretation of a statutory provision. Finally, in sharp contrast with the discretion afforded to the President [by the] … statute at issue in Dalton, Congress could not have been clearer that the GGRF was enacted to ‘enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies,’ and that EPA had to obligate all grant funding by September 30, 2024. […] Dalton cannot sanction EPA nullifying clear statutory directives by terminating these programs.”

They also criticize the panel for dismissing without basis key factual findings by the district court, writing, “The district court did not, as the panel writes, ‘simply declare’ that EPA was shutting down the GGRF program. […] Rather, the district court made well-supported findings of fact that EPA’s out-of-court words and actions contradicted the Agency’s representations in the litigation that the GGRF program would continue following termination of Plaintiffs’ grants.”

“If the panel decision stands, it would set precedent that any agency can simply unwind any Congressionally-mandated program, unilaterally ending contracts without process, seizing money in private bank accounts, and clawing back already-disbursed funds. Congress’s exclusive power of the purse would be in name only. This Court should grant rehearing en banc,” the Senators concluded.

INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE AND RULE 29(a)(4)(E) STATEMENT

Amici curiae include the original champions of Green Bank legislation and its passage as the GGRF; the Ranking Members of the Senate and House committees with jurisdiction over the GGRF (U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce); the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee with jurisdiction over GGRF funding; and other Members of Congress with a particularized interest in preserving the separation of powers and ensuring that Congress’s plenary power over appropriations and spending is protected.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Congress passed the IRA in 2022, which authorized and appropriated nearly $20 billion for the GGRF programs at issue here: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA). Congress directed that these funds must be granted to specialized nonprofit financial organizations for projects that “reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.” Congress required that the EPA obligate GGRF funds by September 30, 2024. EPA met the deadline and entered into Financial Agent Agreements to “[convey] to the grantees legal title to the award funds” while “affording EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of the funds than it would have had under the default disbursement system.” Climate United Fund v. Citibank, 2025 WL 2502881 at *16 (D.C. Cir. Sept 2, 2025) (Pillard, J. dissenting) (citing Bafford Decl. ¶ 33 (J.A. 372)).

After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations. EPA’s subsequent blanket termination of the NCIF and the CCIA programs willfully ignores Congressional spending power and puts $20 billion of community and clean energy investments at risk. This is not a prosaic contract dispute; this is a constitutional power grab.

The panel errs in finding that Plaintiffs’ appropriations claims are prohibited by Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994). An agency’s failure to spend congressionally appropriated funds is illegal under In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Yet the panel wrongly allows EPA to seize GGRF funds that were appropriated by Congress and fully disbursed into private bank accounts. Unlike in Dalton, which was not an appropriations case, here Congress mandated how, by when, and to whom appropriated funds should be granted. It is black letter law that Congress enjoys plenary appropriations power. As held by the Supreme Court in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 464 (1998), the executive branch does not have the power to repeal a statute by withholding its funding. To hold otherwise would give the executive branch free rein to ignore Congressional appropriations decisions. This Court should grant rehearing, to consider the constitutional issues raised by EPA’s misdeeds.

ARGUMENT

EPA’s Actions

Violate Congress’s Appropriations Power.

The panel decision acknowledges that EPA terminated the full amount of all grants made under two GGRF grant programs, but discards the district court record and precedential case law to conclude that the grantees’ challenge “is not a constitutional claim at all” and is only a challenge to the IRA. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *10. This is exactly backwards: the existence of a potential statutory violation does not displace a constitutional claim, and the dispositive question is whether the Administration has exceeded its constitutional powers. Here, it has: Congress required EPA to spend the GGRF funds before September 30, 2024, and EPA would have been prohibited from refusing to do so. EPA’s efforts to terminate funding after disbursement are equally impermissible. Nor was there any basis to overturn the district court’s thorough analysis concluding that EPA terminated the grant programs wholesale.

A. The Panel Erred in Rejecting the Constitutional Claim.

The Court should grant en banc review and not allow an overly expansive interpretation of Dalton to nullify Congressional spending power. By stretching Dalton to reject Plaintiffs’ separation of powers claims, and shoehorning Plaintiffs’ remaining claims into contractual disputes under the ill-fitting Tucker Act, the panel swept constitutional questions under the rug.

This case concerns EPA’s unilateral termination of all grants under two GGRF programs (in addition to at least eight other programs beyond this case, see infra note 4), after all the funds had been dispersed to private bank accounts. These brazen actions usurped power assigned to Congress by the Constitution. Under our Constitution, the power of the purse belongs to Congress, not the President or his agents. U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7 (Appropriations Clause); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (Spending Clause). Congress may employ that power “to further broad policy objectives” and as the dissent points out, “neither the President nor his subordinate executive agencies may decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibit spending because of policy objections.” Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *14 (Pillard, J., dissenting).

Dalton simply does not apply here. That case stands for the limited proposition that “[w]here a statute . . . commits decision-making to the discretion of the President, judicial review of the President’s decision is not available.” 511 U.S. at 477. But no statute gave the President, let alone EPA, discretion to terminate all previously obligated and disbursed funds allocated by Congress for two GGRF programs. Plaintiffs’ claims here do not depend on termination of a single contract, withholding of a disputed grant amount, or even administrative interpretation of a statutory provision. Finally, in sharp contrast with the discretion afforded to the President under the military base closure statute at issue in Dalton, Congress could not have been clearer that the GGRF was enacted to “enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy or benefit from zero-emission technologies,” and that EPA had to obligate all grant funding by September 30, 2024. 42 U.S.C. § 7434. Dalton cannot sanction EPA nullifying clear statutory directives by terminating these programs.

Nor can the panel’s expansion of Dalton be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the executive from unilaterally refusing to spend appropriated funds – let alone claw back actually disbursed funds. In Clinton, the Supreme Court struck down the line item veto as unconstitutional, because Article I, § 7 of the Constitution makes clear that the President cannot cancel a law without Congress’s express authorization. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 446. Decided after Dalton, the Court’s opinion in Clinton specifically rejected the argument that cancellations of Congressionally appropriated programs were “merely exercises of discretionary authority granted to the President.” Id. at 442. Instead, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the bedrock principle that the Constitution does not permit “the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Id. at 438. The panel’s broad recharacterization of Dalton into the appropriations context effectively gives an unconstitutional line item veto to this Administration.

It is similarly not possible to square the panel’s reading of Dalton with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Train v. New York, 420 U.S. 35, 42-47 (1975). There, the Supreme Court held that language in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act that the EPA “shall” allot funds by a date certain meant what it said. Train, 420 U.S. at 42-47. At the direction of President Nixon, the EPA Administrator allotted less than what the Act specified. Id. at 40. The Supreme Court ruled that the Administrator could not do so. Inclusion of the phrase “not to exceed” did not provide discretion to the EPA to refuse to spend the funds; it only preserved the possibility that approved applications for funds already allotted “would not total the maximum amount authorized to be appropriated.” Id. at 44. Here, the statutory directive is even clearer: Congress appropriated specific sums to carry out the GGRF programs, to be spent by a specific date, and to be provided to specified eligible entities.

Meanwhile, on the correct factual record, Aiken County is indistinguishable. See Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *29 (“[A]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.”) (Pillard, J., dissenting, quotation and citation omitted). Under Aiken County, an agency may not refuse to spend appropriated funds in violation of a statutory obligation. Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 257-69. As then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote: “where previously appropriated money is available for an agency to perform a statutorily mandated activity, we see no basis for a court to excuse the agency from that statutory mandate.” Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260. The panel tries to avoid this precedent by discarding the district court’s well-supported findings and lending undue credibility to EPA’s inconsistent justifications for terminating the grants. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. As set out below, the district court’s factual conclusion that EPA had no intention of re-awarding the GGRF money was amply supported; thus, Aiken County should control. The district court correctly found that the Plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on this claim.

B. The Panel Wrongly Substituted Its Own Inferences and Factfinding for That of District Court

The panel avoids the clear dictates of Clinton and Aiken County only by rewriting the factual record in the case and overturning the district court’s factual findings. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. But this turns logic upside down, dispensing with the district court’s detailed factfinding while affording the government a presumption of regularity that strains credulity. Where “the district court’s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.” Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).

The district court did not, as the panel writes, “simply declare” that EPA was shutting down the GGRF program. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. Rather, the district court made well-supported findings of fact that EPA’s out-of-court words and actions contradicted the Agency’s representations in the litigation that the GGRF program would continue following termination of Plaintiffs’ grants. Specifically:

The district court found that EPA initially claimed fraud and conflicts of interest in grant awards and enlisted the FBI to pressure Citibank to freeze funds, but then admitted the terminations were “based on reasons of policy” when it could produce no evidence of fraud. Climate United, 778 F.Supp.3d at 114-115.

The district court found that EPA served Plaintiffs with identical information requests on the GGRF program’s oversight controls then terminated all the grants prior to receiving responses. Id. at 114. From this action, the district court reasonably inferred that the government’s reference to lack of oversight was a pretext.

The district court found that EPA refused to provide any rationale for why it terminated the grants, why cancellation was necessary when EPA had begun to examine the grant programs to add oversight mechanisms, or “why it needed to cancel every single grant to review some aspects of the GGRF program . . . .” Id.

The district court found that “[t]hroughout February and March 2025, Administrator Zeldin began to publicly express his desire to take control of the funds disbursed under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to terminate the GGRF grants . . . and that EPA is ‘not going to rest’ until it recovered the grant funds.” Id. at 102. The district court was not “clearly erroneous” in concluding that these public statements by the EPA Administrator, alongside an executive order directing agencies to halt all IRA disbursements to “terminate the Green New Deal,” betrayed the actual, unlawful reason for the grant terminations and the intent to end the program.

The panel erred further by faulting the district court for “ignor[ing]” the “gold bars” video. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11 n.12. But of course the district court gave no evidentiary value to that video: it is patently irrelevant to the GGRF. The video concerns efforts to award different grant money after the November 2024 election. All the GGRF grants were awarded by September – months before.

The panel also erred in holding that the district court should have afforded EPA’s unsupported and inconsistent representations a presumption of regularity. Climate United, 2025 WL 2502881 at *11. The “presumption of regularity” is a limited, rebuttable presumption that applies to authenticity of government documents and official acts. Latif v. Obama, 677 F.3d 1175, 1178 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The district court did not refuse to consider EPA’s evidence or account of its actions but rather determined – after significant factual analysis – that EPA’s representations were unsupported by the broader factual record. The district court found that EPA first sought to terminate grant funding through a criminal investigation, and when that failed, shifted its position to claim that the terminations were based on changed agency priorities. Climate United, 778 F.Supp.3d at 115. Although EPA claimed it conducted an “individualized assessment” of the grants, the district court found that EPA had not provided any rationale for the terminations. Id. at 115-116. The district court, as the finder of fact, concluded that EPA’s “public statements contradict its representations here regarding the future of the program.” Id. at 116. These factual conclusions were firmly grounded in the record and should not have been disturbed by the panel.

CONCLUSION

The stakes presented by this power grab are high. In the NCIF and CCIA programs under the GGRF, Congress directed EPA to grant nearly $20 billion to nonprofit financial organizations for the purpose of reducing pollution and energy costs for low-income and disadvantaged communities. There is considerable reliance on those grants, which were disbursed to private accounts nearly a year ago.

If the panel decision stands, it would set precedent that any agency can simply unwind any Congressionally-mandated program, unilaterally ending contracts without process, seizing money in private bank accounts, and clawing back already-disbursed funds.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of a bipartisan permitting reform framework. As momentum builds for Congress to act on permitting reform, the recommendations in this framework offer a commonsense, two-party roadmap to streamline the permitting process, boost energy production of all kinds, and give investors the clarity and confidence they need to invest in America.

This framework was developed by the Problem Solvers Caucus Permitting, Energy & Environment Working Group, led by Reps. Scott Peters (CA-50) and Gabe Evans (CO-08), along with Co-Chairs Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) and Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

The framework reflects months of bipartisan collaboration with energy producers, industry experts, Members across committees of jurisdiction, and stakeholders across the political spectrum. It lays out a path forward to update the permitting system so the United States can compete globally and remain a responsible steward of the environment.

With the country poised to see one of the largest increases in energy demand in decades, Congress needs to act now. Communities and businesses across the country are facing rising costs and growing demand for affordable, reliable energy. Yet, too many projects remain stalled for years — some more than a decade — due to outdated regulations, duplicative reviews, and endless litigation, stifling innovation and driving up costs for families.

Key elements of the framework include:

• Cutting red tape for linear infrastructure projects

• Meeting growing energy demand across sectors

• Reforming outdated and duplicative NEPA requirements

• Establishing clear, enforceable permitting deadlines

• Strengthening domestic supply chains

“America faces a choice between cheap, abundant energy from all of the above sources or higher energy prices, falling behind China, and an increased risk of blackouts,” said Congressman Scott Peters (CA-50). “It’s obvious where we need to go. To get there, we know we need to update our environmental laws to meet the challenges of today and invest in a grid for this century. This platform represents a bipartisan commitment to set aside ideology and solve this problem for the American people. I look forward to working with my colleagues to keep the momentum going and turn this into legislation that can pass both chambers of Congress.”

“Reforming our permitting system is crucial, and this framework meets the moment for much-needed change. The demand for affordable and reliable energy of all kinds becomes increasingly urgent,” said Congressman Gabe Evans (CO-08). “By cutting through red tape, we can meet energy demand, lower costs, strengthen national security, and create high-quality jobs in America, while being responsible stewards of the environment and maintaining our position of global leadership and not cede ground to China. The urgency is real, and I am proud of this bipartisan push for change.”

“The number one issue Americans are concerned about is the cost of living,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Tom Suozzi (NY-03). “Sky-high energy costs play an enormous role—electricity prices rose more than 6.5% in just the last year, and demand is skyrocketing. Right now it takes years, even decades, for new green energy and other projects to get connected to the grid and start generating energy to meet demand. We need commonsense, bipartisan solutions to cut red tape, bring projects online faster, and make energy more affordable for American families. That’s exactly what this framework does.”

“America wins the future by building faster, smarter, and cleaner than our competitors — lowering costs, creating jobs, and strengthening security here at home. But our permitting system has been holding us back. The Problem Solvers Caucus is changing that,” said Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chair Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01). “Our bipartisan framework sets clear rules, enforces real deadlines, unleashes investment in every form of American energy, and strengthens our security and supply chains while protecting our environment. This is the model for governing in the 21st century: two parties coming together to clear the path for innovation, jobs, and affordable energy — proving that when both parties lead together, America leads the world.”

“Too much government red tape drives up costs for Nevada families and industries alike. As one of the top two geothermal states in the country, red tape is currently preventing us from unleashing our full clean power potential and getting reliable and affordable energy on the grid,” said Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03). “I’m thrilled to have a bipartisan framework that includes my proposed geothermal permitting reforms.“

“As Co-Chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I believe we need to move energy and infrastructure projects forward in a way that strengthens our economy, lowers costs, and protects our environment,” said Congressman Andrew Garbarino (NY-02). “This permitting reform framework is a step toward cutting through red tape so we can build cleaner, more reliable energy, create good-paying jobs, bolster our supply chains, and secure American energy dominance for the future.”",https://scottpeters.house.gov/vendor/_accounts/scottpeters/_skins/peters/images/twitter_card.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 01:59:14.110120

The partnership combines Denham’s experience in developing, building, and operating large-scale power plants across six different continents, and B&W’s experience in coal power generation and the conversion of coal-fired power plants to use natural gas.

“Data centers have created an unprecedented and immediate demand for power generation, the likes of which we have not seen in nearly two decades,” said Justin DeAngelis, Global Head of Sustainable Infrastructure at Denham Capital. “Time-to-power is a key focal point for data center developers and hyperscalers, and this partnership is one differentiated tool we are looking to utilize to meet market needs.”

“We are delighted to partner with B&W to offer reliable, fast, low-cost and sustainable power solutions to the data center market, leveraging B&W’s nearly 160 years of expertise in power boilers, and bringing Denham’s 10 GW of experience in developing, constructing or operating power generation,” DeAngelis said. “Given the scale of this opportunity, Denham will shortly announce a dedicated portfolio company focused on delivering these solutions. It is vital we leverage existing power fleets, decarbonize, and increase the quality and security of our power generation systems.”

According to Industrial Info Resources (IIR), as of early March, there were over 1,900 data center projects in development in the U.S., with a total investment exceeding $800 billion. A lot of this announced spend is tied up in multi-building campuses with additions that are planned out to 2035.

What are the relevant PFAS?

PFAS are synthetic chemicals used in many products and materials by a broad range of industries—from cosmetics to textiles—because they resist heat, water, and oil. Given their widespread use, these chemicals are relatively ubiquitous at low levels and have been detected in soil, sediments, groundwater, and surface water at many sites. The EPA rule at issue focuses on two PFAS specifically, PFOA and PFOS, given their widespread use and prevalence in the environment.

What does the rule do?

The EPA’s April 2024 rule designates PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. The rule establishes substantial reporting requirements for PFOA and PFOS releases, allows the EPA to initiate response actions without showing imminent and substantial endangerment, and perhaps most importantly, allows parties to pursue reimbursement or contribution claims for cleanups of these two substances. CERCLA’s strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability regime is particularly concerning in the context of chemicals like PFOA and PFOS that are ubiquitous in the environment and resistant to degradation.

More details on the rule’s specific requirements can be found in analysis from the Alston & Bird team here and here.

What’s the rule’s current status?

After the rule went into effect in July 2024, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and industry groups petitioned for review by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that the agency had wrongly applied CERCLA and did not adequately assess the costs and benefits extending Superfund liability to PFAS contamination. With the Trump Administration’s arrival, the EPA moved for a stay in February 2025, and the case has been paused since then while the agency decided whether to continue defending the rule.

In its September 17 motion this week, the EPA asked the court to lift the stay. Attached to the motion was a declaration from a senior adviser to the EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management stating that the agency will continue to “engage with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.” This goal of protecting so-called “passive receivers” raises significant questions, including the criteria for determining which entities qualify, the scope of protections provided, and the potential of unintended consequences on enforcement actions and cost allocations at sites where these entities are involved. The EPA has indicated that Congress will have to adopt new statutory language to address concerns with passive receiver liability.

The decision to retain the PFAS Superfund rule contrasts with other Trump Administration actions to relax PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act and push back compliance deadlines under similar legislation.

Next Steps

As litigation against the rule proceeds, companies and stakeholders should follow developments both at the congressional and EPA levels, where prominent leaders in both branches have supported measures to keep the rule but excuse so-called “passive receivers” from liability. For now, companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams, be mindful of potential PFAS contamination during environmental due diligence for transactions, and stay informed on potential liability that may arise from real property investments.

""If you're going to think about trying to get tax credit for your electric vehicle, act now. Don't wait till the last minute,"" said John Warren is an enrolled agent at Medford Tax Experts.

Here's what you need to know:

Consumers must buy the EV - before the deadline.

""The car can still be on order, or you can still be waiting for delivery, and you can still get this tax credit,"" Warren said.

Before signing the contract, make sure to read the fine print.

Eligibility for the tax credit, especially for used cars, could hinge on the type of car and how much money you make.

""In some cases, you can apply the credit if you're going to enter into a lease agreement with the car dealer and you can use the credit to lower the purchase price by $7,500,"" said Warren. ""The credit will go to the car dealer directly.""

A complete list of qualifying vehicles is available on fueleconomy.gov.

The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion.

The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey.

The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water.

“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release.

Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed.

Estimates of the project’s total cost come to about $260 million, according to the CPRA. A previous $28.6 million grant was put toward planning costs with any remainder to be rolled over for construction and maintenance.

“The Calcasieu-Sabine project reflects the kind of large-scale, science-based restoration prioritized in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said.. “We’re now moving from planning to action in one of the most vulnerable areas of our coast, where this investment will make a measurable difference.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_9101-1024x6831758312506.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ntbz57FF,N,,2025-09-20 04:59:02.870790

The plant is estimated to bring 512 jobs to Northwest Indiana by 2016, a huge win for the area, as unemployment remains relatively high.

Mayor Olga Velazquez was on hand as well, excited at the opportunity this new business venture brings to Portage. “Can you feel the energy?” she exclaimed to the crowd.

She continued, “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the governor and his team as well as the Indiana Economic Development Corporation and Jim Staton, for working with us at the local level to help bring this project to Portage. Thank you very much.”

This announcement marks the 1,000th new business establishment or expansion completed by the Indiana Economic Development Corporation since 2005.

“In order to compete, we must collaborate,” said Velazquez. “And this is truly a shining example of the collaboration that happened with the state government and private industry to realize positive results.“

“We’re excited to be able to introduce more of the U.S. especially to Fronius’ forward-thinking people, quality products, and superior service which have helped our position as a global leader in all three areas of our operations,” said Thomas Herndler, member of the Management Board for the manufacturing department of Fronius.

Fronius is the fourth-largest solar inverter producer in the world, and will relocate its North American headquarters from Michigan to the soon-to-be-built 400,000 square-foot facility in the Ameriplex complex in Portage.

“There were many factors that needed to be considered to choose the best location for the new site, but Indiana quickly became a contender,” explained Wolfgang Niedrist, the Managing Director for Fronius USA. “It has a strong educational system that will help us train our employees, as well as a talented workforce. There is a solid network of suppliers, some essential to the manufacturing of quality products.”

“On behalf of the citizens of Portage, please extend our extreme and sincere appreciation for choosing Portage to be your new home,” Velazquez told the crowd.

Too often, we have seen energy production or transmission projects languishing in litigation and redundant bureaucracy for years. As a result, Americans have been unable to fully benefit from our nation’s vast energy resources.

As a member of Congress and as the leader of an energy non-profit, we know that durable policy change as impactful as reforming our broken permitting process requires public buy-in. This is where federal policy and education from institutions like CRES go hand-in-hand — legislative action will help ensure long-term growth and informing Americans about how this will improve day-to-day life is key to garnering support. We know that passing comprehensive permitting reform will not only create jobs, but spur innovation, and the key is communicating that economic impact.

Improving federal permitting will create jobs and give business the certainty they need to invest in long term projects. Permitting reform will benefit all sources of energy production, meaning it could also help to lower consumption costs. However, supporting homegrown energy sources isn't just about supporting an American energy dominance agenda — it’s about boosting our local economies and American businesses. Take nuclear, an industry long burdened by red tape that supports roughly a quarter of a million jobs. Or wind, which boasts more than 300,000 jobs across all 50 states. Imagine if we made it easier to bring these job creating energy sources online?

Increased energy production is more important than ever with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI data centers need an immense amount of power — and one way to ensure we have that energy is an efficient and streamlined permitting process. To put it simply: data centers aren't just a trend; they're part of the next generation of the industrial economy, and we have to be ready to capitalize on their potential. This can be seen in Ohio, which is ranked fourth in the country for volume of data centers. We all use AI in our daily lives, and we need to take federal action to ensure the technology has the energy it needs to power its continued integration into our lives.

We need significantly more power, at lower costs, and the key is to use every tool and resource available to us. This is more important than ever, and should be a central focus of Washington, especially during this National Clean Energy Week.

There is so much to be gained from unleashing American energy: strengthening the economy, job creation, and innovation — but we have to get the policies right. Energy production, and the ability to move it, will be the defining need of our generation. As we continue to push pragmatic energy policy in the beltway and beyond, we look forward to working with the Trump administration to put American energy first.

Petrochemical companies and other industries in the coastal area need a lot of water and were already using the lion’s share of the municipal water supply.

The city of Corpus Christi is in a water crisis. It’s in stage three water restriction right now.

Desalination was being floated as the best solution. But it's expensive.

The project had ballooned from earlier estimates of $750 million to about $1.2 billion with residential users expected to pay for it with a 20 percent water rate increase.

Recently at a very long, emotionally charged city council meeting, many residents and environmental advocates spoke against the project. Major concerns included the high cost, fiscal risk, environmental damage—especially discharge of super-salty brine into the bay—and the unequal benefits.

But it was the cost concerns that eventually killed the project.

There was pressure from state officials pushing for desalination seeing this technology as a long-term partial solution to growing water needs for the state. For example, Governor Greg Abbott’s office had supported the project and provided some funding. But council members who opposed it said that despite the political pressure, the financial and broader benefit risks were too large.

Scrapping the Inner Harbor project is being seen as a major victory for the Corpus Christi community organizers who maintained pressure throughout the decade-long planning process.

They succeeded by mobilizing public testimony, framing the environmental stakes, and focusing on transparency and fiscal accountability.

Their strategy included showing how costs had escalated, how jobs or other claimed benefits were unclear, and insisting on alternatives.

The large public engagement shifted the political balance, making it politically costly for officials to support a plan seen as risky and burdensome.

Measles vaccine

On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory panel on vaccines voted to weaken recommendations for a measles vaccine that includes protection against the varicella virus, or the chickenpox.

They are saying the vaccine, called MMRV, shouldn’t be recommended for children under age 4 because of a small risk for seizures in that age group.

The seizures can be prompted by fevers associated with viruses. Doctors say that while they are scary for parents to witness, they are generally harmless.

It’s unknown if this recommendation will result in a policy change at the CDC but supporters of vaccines are alarmed.

Terri Burke says that would have had tragic consequences for Texans, given the fact the state just endured the worst outbreak of measles in 30 years.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6fb9fe4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/916x481+0+62/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F35%2F496e1feb4085a733d2cf8dcd6b9c%2Fdesal.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:01:44.394780

Hello and welcome to Eco Report. In today’s feature report, WFHB Assistant News Director Noelle Herhusky-Schneider reports on National Moth Week, a citizen science project to study and record populations of moths.

And here’s your environmental reports:

There is a Kissing bugs warning from CDC. Native insects aren’t always adorable bumblebees or beautiful butterflies. The triatomine insect, or “kissing bug,” is native to Indiana but it’s been making recent news as a danger. The CDC has issued a warning about the recent cases of Chagas disease—a parasitic infection that, while not immediately dangerous, can be deadly if untreated.

Environmental leaders from across the Great Lakes region gathered in Toledo this week for a groundbreaking summit focused on restoring the most polluted areas in the Great Lakes system. The “Areas of Concern Cross-Agency Partnership Summit” brought together federal, state, and local officials to coordinate restoration efforts. These “areas of concern” are locations that have experienced significant environmental degradation. The summit took place in the Maumee area, Ohio’s largest area of concern which has seen significant investment aimed at transformation.

The timing of this summit highlights major restoration progress happening across the region. Following a successful cleanup, the EPA removed New York’s Rochester Embayment from the list of most polluted Great Lakes areas, Since the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative began in 2010, the restoration program has already delisted 7 “areas of concern” and enhanced, protected, and restored nearly 530,000 acres of habitat, 13% of which are coastal wetlands.

Feeling the Heat? These fossil fuel giants are to blame, new study says. Climate change increased the probability and intensity of more than 200 heat waves across the globe over the last two decades, according to a newly published study.

Human-Caused Warming Tripled the Death Toll of European Heat Waves This Summer, New Report Shows

Public health researchers struggle to track the accelerating pace of global warming impact.

The folks from Campbell’s soup company are in hot water after officials admit that they’ve been dumping water in the Maumee River for over 6 years, violating the Clean Water Act thousands of times. This isn’t just about soup production gone wrong—it’s about contaminated water that affects everyone downstream. The factory dumps its waste into the Maumee River, which flows directly into Lake Erie. Phosphorus from the wastewater feeds toxic algae blooms that can harm swimmers and contaminate drinking water with dangerous cyanobacteria—something residents of Monroe County and visitors to Lake Monroe are all too familiar with.

The actor and influential environmentalist, Robert Redford, has passed away. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Redford spent over fifty years advocating for public lands and protected waters in the West, protecting wildlife, pursuing environmental justice for Indigenous communities, and climate action. Redford was one of the early voices speaking out about climate change and the choices developers, communities, and governments can make in safeguarding the planet for future generations. Redford, a longtime resident of Utah, was 89.

“I just can’t emphasize enough what an impact that ARCUS has had to the Arctic research community over the years, and actually to communities in the Arctic.”","After nearly 40 years, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States will close Sept. 30, a casualty of President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts and his administration’s focus on using the Arctic as an outpost for national security and energy dominance—and its push away from science.

As part of the overarching defunding of science after Trump took office, ARCUS’ major funder, the National Science Foundation, chose not to re-open a bid for a community hub project that would have continued to fund the nonprofit.

ARCUS had been trying to diversify its funding sources, but still received 93 percent of its funding—$1.7 million— from the NSF in fiscal year 2023, according to the nonprofit’s most recently available tax records.

While NSF is an independent federal agency, it relies on government funding to award grants to other organizations. It is also the lead agency responsible for implementing Arctic research policy. It is accepting input on the next five-year plan until Nov. 15.

In May, Trump released his budget request, which would cut NSF funding by 56 percent, from $9 billion to $3.9 billion. The request “reflects a strategic alignment of resources in a constrained fiscal environment in which NSF prioritizes investments that can have the greatest national impact,” an NSF spokesperson told Inside Climate News in an email.

The NSF spokesperson did not answer questions about the rationale for the cuts, how the money would be redirected and any connection between the reduction and the Trump administration’s national security plans for the Arctic region.

The U.S. House of Representatives is proposing a 23 percent decrease in NSF spending levels, while the Senate’s reductions are comparatively minimal, just 0.7 percent.

The ARCUS board recommended that the organization shut down, a move supported by the membership. “This decision to sunset ARCUS was not rash in any way,” said Audrey Taylor, its executive director, on a farewell call to supporters, scientists and media on Friday. “It was responsive to a number of things happening throughout the funding streams and throughout the federal government and the Arctic research community landscape writ large that have been going on for a number of years, but certainly came to a head in this last six months.”

Founded in 1988, ARCUS advanced Arctic research by connecting scientists, government agencies, Indigenous communities and nonprofits all over the world. Its dozens of projects included an Indigenous scholars program, the launch of the Sea Ice Prediction Network and an initiative to develop the prediction network’s sea ice forecast reports.

That research not only shed light on the effects of global climate change on sea ice, but provided crucial information for local subsistence hunters and businesses that relied on Alaskan shipping channels.

ARCUS, based in Fairbanks, Alaska, is closing at a critical time. Over the past several decades, federal data show Arctic air, ocean and land temperatures have increased at a rate more than twice the global average.

In May, the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy revised an implementation plan for the Arctic. Under the Biden administration, it had prioritized community resilience and health, hazard mitigation and sustainable economies and livelihoods, as well as the global climate impacts of a warming Arctic.

The Trump administration amended the list to prioritize community, economic, energy and military security. The changes mirror an executive order that Trump issued on his first day in office, “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential,” that rescinded Biden-era energy regulations and replaced them with measures to fast-track fossil fuel drilling and exploration.

The melting of Arctic sea ice also allows other countries, particularly Russia and China, to more easily access the region. That could turn Alaska into a chessboard for international military maneuvers, whose value is measured by its geopolitical usefulness—similar to Hawaii and Guam.

“In the early days, anything we did in Arctic research had to be justified from the importance of why the Arctic was important to the Lower 48,” Larry Hinzman said on the farewell call. He is the former assistant director for polar sciences and the executive director for the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee in the White House from 2020 to 2024.

“ARCUS has really helped us change that perception and made the Arctic a presence in its own right,” Hinzman said. “I just can’t emphasize enough what an impact that ARCUS has had to the Arctic research community over the years, and actually to communities in the Arctic.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2215603850-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 19:01:28.577719

Many spots again observed a more than 30° jump from the observed low temperatures to the observed high temperatures. Most once again ended up with highs in the upper 80s with several 90° readings.

Our blocking pattern this week ends soon! Notice the counterclockwise spin of an upper low. It drifts east tonight and brings more clouds here first. There are showers in Illinois but those will have a tough time holding as they enter a very dry environment. I won’t rule out a stray shower tonight but most, if not all, stay dry.

This weekend is when the changes arrive. If you have outdoor plans, Saturday is the day when rain shouldn’t bring impacts. Expect mostly to partly cloudy skies with the warm temperatures continuing in the upper 80s. As that upper-level low gets closer, the slightly higher rain chances come with it starting Sunday.

With the changes, this low will be cut off from the jet stream and nearly stationary from Sunday into the work week. This means (1) daily chances exist, (2) dry hours are promised and (3) cooler temperatures but higher dew points will be around. In the near term, the highest rain chances look to be late Sunday into Monday morning then again toward the middle of the week.

Total rainfall will help in putting a dent in our drought situation. However, it won’t help when it comes to the longer 60-90 day lack of rainfall across central Indiana. Most of the region is now under a Moderate Drought.

The 120-acre site at 1500 S. Tibbs Ave. has a long history of contamination.

It operated as a specialty chemicals production facility since the 1950s. Until 1972, a coal-tar refining and wood treatment facility that used creosote operated at the site. Creosote is a substance considered a likely contributor to cancer. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, site operators used a trench, a landfill and several pits to dispose of waste. Those waste handling practices contaminated the groundwater and soil.

The EPA placed it on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1984.

She remembers a few neighbors who still used wells and weren’t hooked up to city water. They had to get rid of their wells because the water wasn’t safe to drink.

Groundwater monitors detected benzene, a cancer-causing chemical.

“It’s like, what is this going to do to our health?” Linda said. “A lot of our neighbors are gone now, but they all felt the same thing that we did.”

“It’s nothing today like it was in the 80s,” she said. “But it’s still scary, because we lived here that whole time and you don’t know what the future holds.”

The existing groundwater extraction system has been operating at the site since 1994.

This month, crews will begin installing a new air sparging system. It’s intended to capture contaminants including benzene, ammonia and pyridine. The EPA says air sparging is the process of injecting air into the ground below the water table. It flushes the contaminants up through the groundwater as air bubbles and gets captured with a vapor extraction system.

1500 South Tibbs LCC is responsible for installing 73 air sparging wells along the east side under EPA’s oversight.

Crews will also install additional wells to monitor the cleanup process.

The EPA estimates the construction will be done in February. The existing system will remain online until the new air sparging system is fully operational.

“These are the pods once they’re mostly dry. But you can see we’ve got some of different colors,” Geiger said. “This is a blue-ish gray pod.”

He’s working with the Utopian Seed Project, an Asheville-based nonprofit, to test crops that will be climate resilient.

“Having seeds and crops that are resilient to our weather extremes is the best way to adapt to a changing climate,” Geiger said.

Several years ago, Geiger owned a food truck, then started a farm in Denton in 2020.

“[I] just got real interested in sourcing local ingredients and then kind of went down a rabbit hole of growing them myself,” Geiger said.

He says now he’s fairly hooked on farming.

With this project, he’s contributing to growing ingredients that can withstand the volatile nature of weather.

“Having more resilient plant varieties is definitely very important as we see more weather extreme events,” Geiger said.

The Utopian Seed Project uses crossbreeding to take different varieties to create hybrid versions of crops. Then Geiger can select and refine the seed collection. This year he grew three to four varieties of southern peas.

“These are the black-eyed peas that we’ve already shelled and harvested,” Geiger said.

With the southern peas that performed best, he’ll take those seeds and grow them again next year for a higher yield.

“It’s great. I’m very excited to be able to share our progress with the other growers. We have little groups that we’re able to share our successes, failures, what’s doing the best. Being able to collaborate and be in these groups with other plant breeders and seed savers,” Geiger said. “It makes me feel like there’s good progress to be had.”

“Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.” Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive.
Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost.","East Lansing — In the soft dirt of an indoor horseback riding ring last month, a group of farmers got ready to test drive a new piece of equipment: an electric tractor.

As they took turns climbing in — some surprised by its quick acceleration — they gave real-time feedback to the Michigan State University researchers who have been developing it for over two years.

The farmers remarked on the motor's quiet whir. Most were intrigued, or at least open to the idea. Some were concerned that the battery on the underside of the carriage would mean a lower clearance over the field, while others worried that it would simply be too expensive.

“What we hope to do when we retire is we want to get everything electric on the farm. The tractor is the last electric implement to get,” said Don Dunklee, one of the farmers to provide feedback. He runs a small organic vegetable farm that's relied on wind and solar for decades.

The market is fairly new, but some researchers and entrepreneurs think electric tractors will be ideal for small farmers who care about sustainability and want to market their products that way. The small cherry-red, open-cab machine is well-suited for tasks like weeding fields of specialty crops like carrots or asparagus, or squeezing between the tight rows of orchard trees. Farmers with solar panels can avoid the cost of diesel.

Agriculture is among the largest sources of climate-warming emissions worldwide. Though tractors are a small culprit, experts believe an environmentally friendly machine would still attract buyers interested in sustainability.

“There’s reduced emissions, but before you get there, you have to be solving for other problems,” including noise, ease of use and cost, said Derek Muller, business manager for battery electric systems at John Deere.

There are downsides — electric tractors are aimed at filling a niche, not overturning the status quo. And while battery technology has come a long way, they can’t last all day or match the massive horsepower of a diesel engine that sets giant tractors cruising through the sprawling grain and soybean operations of the Midwest.

Few companies offer electric tractor options

In addition to battery limitations, there are other structural obstacles. Most farmers do not have fast electric chargers, nor do they have solar panels to supply those chargers with free electricity — diesel would need to be much more expensive for the economics to turn sharply in favor of electric. But companies are starting to see an opportunity.

“For John Deere, it is not the only solution,” Muller said. “It’s not going to be where we lead our efforts. It’s going to be one of many options.”

The company has built a small utility electric tractor prototype. It joins a limited set of offerings from other companies like Monarch Tractor, which started in 2019 with the aim to help farmers, who have traditionally struggled with razor-thin profits to save money, work sustainably and more efficiently.

Ajit Srivastava, an agricultural engineer and Michigan State professor who hosted the farmer feedback session, wants to help smallholder farmers across the world. Such farmers grow about a third of the world’s food, but many do it with only hand tools. He started trying to emulate a pair of oxen made of off-the-shelf parts, so anyone could build it themselves.

“If we were to mechanize all the smallholder farmers in the world, there isn’t enough diesel out there to power them. So we have to find some other source,” Srivastava said.

It's still a work in progress. Rain had postponed the feedback session, originally planned for the spring, because the tractor hadn't been waterproofed yet. It also doesn't have enough power for some jobs like tilling. But farmers generally like what Srivastava had developed. He hopes it could eventually be sold for roughly $30,000, substantially cheaper than some of the competition.

“The steering is really responsive. It just seems to run really smooth,” said Dunklee, adding, however, that it might not do everything he needs on a farm yet. “Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.”

Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive. And there's also a market at universities in other countries where researchers are studying agriculture, said Brendan Dowdle, chief business officer of Bonsai Robotics, which sells modular, automated electric farm robots that can work together to mimic some tasks ordinarily done by a tractor.

One possible customer is the so-called “gentleman farmer” who has a small operation of specialty crops or vegetables and farms for fun, not necessarily to make a living.

“They want to be self-sustaining,” said Patrick Woolcock, an associate engineering professor and agriculture expert at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

Plus, without harmful diesel emissions, they can work in greenhouses and, with fewer parts, there's hope repairs won't be as complicated, at least once a readily available supply is established.

Could electric tractors be more compatible with automation?

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost. Engineers are now designing machines that will drive themselves and power precise weeders and planters.

For example, Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa noted that if a self-guided tractor gets stuck and has to notify the farmer, electric power has clear benefits. A diesel tractor would sit there idling, but an electric one doesn’t waste fuel while waiting.

Srivastava also said he's just trying to make people's lives easier — looking backward all day to make sure a plow is operating properly is grueling. So, a self-driving tractor would let farmers pay more attention to ensuring harvesting is happening properly, or the weeder isn't accidentally digging up crops.

""Not that we want to take the operator off the tractor, the operator would be there, but they can focus on how well the operation is going rather than making sure the tractor is in the rows,"" he said.

Still, some aren’t so sure electric has such a big advantage when it comes to automation. Tim Bucher, CEO of Agtonomy, a company focused on bringing autonomy software to farm vehicles, was all-in on electric a few years ago. But the technology has gotten so good that now his customers can pick and choose the energy source for their tractor and see similar results, he said. And with government electric vehicle subsidies disappearing, there's less incentive for most farmers to go that route.

On his own farm, though, he opts for electric, and he says he's seen economic returns.

And from an environmental perspective, “it also just makes me feel better,” he said.

A companion Request for Information (RFI), with responses due Nov. 21, 2025, aims to surface projects and bottlenecks across regions – everything from inter-regional transmission and reconductoring to bringing retired thermal assets back online or building new and balanced portfolios of generation – and how best to utilize its funding programs and authorities to meet this demand growth.

The launch follows DOE's report, ""Evaluating the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,"" developed under President Donald Trump's executive order (EO) on ""Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid"" (EO 14262). That analysis underscores an urgent reality: Planned retirements and interconnection delays – combined with AI/data center and industrial load growth – are stressing the U.S. electric grid. DOE is now asking industry, states, regulators, utilities and grid operators to help identify what can be advanced quickly and how federal tools should be applied to do so.

How Speed to Power Fits the Administration's Policy Framework

Speed to Power aligns with several administration priorities:

Unleashing American Energy (EO 14154). Emphasizes abundant, reliable and affordable energy across the nation as an economic and national security imperative.

Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI (EO 14179). Prioritizes building U.S. AI dominance to promote economic competitiveness and national security.

Strengthening Grid Reliability and Security (EO 14262). Directs DOE to use a uniform reliability methodology to guide federal interventions to meet growing demand.

Reinvigorating America's Nuclear Industrial Base (EO 14302). Encourages rapid deployment of nuclear generation as firm, dispatchable capacity.

Together, these actions point to a federal posture that is both pro-build and time-sensitive – with Speed to Power as the mechanism to identify and accelerate critical projects that can realistically increase power availability and reliability over the near-term to accommodate and enable load growth.

What DOE Is Looking For

DOE seeks information on large-scale projects that could enable at least 3 GW (and up to 20 GW) of incremental load, including:

New interregional lines (≥1,000 megavolt-amperes (MVA)) and reconductoring of existing lines (≥500 MVA) to increase load-serving capability.

Bringing retired thermal generation facilities back into service or otherwise using the existing interconnection capacity to provide reliable power generation.

DOE is also inviting respondents to flag high-priority geographic areas – such as data center corridors, semiconductor clusters, industrial parks and port complexes – where targeted federal support could unlock major private investment but where grid constraints (i.e., capacity, congestion and interconnection) stand in the way.

Programs and Authorities on the Table

While the RFI is not a funding opportunity, DOE explicitly asks how its programs and authorities should be deployed to accelerate delivery. Relevant tools include:

Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP). DOE acts as an ""anchor customer"" and administers borrowing authority to support and de-risk large interregional projects.

Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP). Competitive funding for grid hardening, optimization and advanced technologies.

Loan Programs Office (LPO). Debt financing for eligible transmission, generation and integrated systems under Title 17 authorities.

Technical Assistance. Modeling, planning support and national lab expertise to help design bankable, buildable solutions.

For sponsors weighing capital stacks, the RFI also invites input on where gaps exist and how DOE could best de-risk early stages to crowd in private capital.

Connection to Recent INL RFA

Speed to Power complements DOE's recent Request for Applications (RFA) for long-term lease agreements to use federal land at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for AI data center and integrated energy infrastructure – a site-specific opportunity that encouraged engagement with GDO and LPO on financing pathways independent of leasing decisions. (See Holland & Knight's previous blog post, ""DOE Opportunity to Lease INL Land for AI Data Centers and Integrated Energy Infrastructure,"" Sept. 12, 2025.)

Who Should Consider Responding

Utilities and public power entities with major load additions or grid constraints in their service territories

Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) coordinating interregional solutions or facing queue backlogs

Large load customers (e.g., AI/data center operators, semiconductor fabrication plants and industrial facilities) with location-specific, near-term needs

Generation and transmission developers with advanced projects that can materially increase power availability and reliability

State energy offices (SEOs) and public utility commissions (PUCs) with development investment zones or corridor designations with projected demand growth from data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, semiconductor plants and other large energy users

Technology and software providers with solutions that can realistically be deployed quickly to increase power availability or address grid constraints

How Holland & Knight Can Help

Holland & Knight advises investors, utilities and large-load customers on federal energy programs, including through GDO (TFP/GRIP) and LPO financing pathways. We can help scope a targeted RFI response, align projects with the appropriate federal tools, and position near-term projects for accelerated delivery.

,Congress,2025-09-19 21:11:19+00:00,www.wbur.org,"As federal tax credits for EVs end, experts worry about Mass. climate goals | WBUR News",Vivian La,,,,,https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/09/19/electric-vehicles-federal-tax-credit-mass,"This quarter, the U.S. could hit an all-time record for EV sales, the report stated.
A Massachusetts-funded EV rebate program will still be available after the federal tax credit ends.
The federal tax credit has income eligibility limits and requirements for vehicles to qualify.
Consumers can also take advantage of lower monthly payments on leased EVs through the expiring tax credit.
The other driver of EV sales, charging stations, seem to be back on track.","Car buyers have less than two weeks to take advantage of federal discounts that provide up to $7,500 toward the purchase of electric vehicles.

With the expiration of the federal tax credit at the end of this month, environmental policy experts said, there's one less incentive to buy the climate-friendly vehicles, and they're concerned about how Massachusetts will meet its goals for slashing planet-warming emissions.

“ It's going to be a lot harder to find a way to increase adoption to the levels that we need,” said Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director at the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

Still, she said, consumers can still make the switch to EVs.

""This is not all going to grind to a halt,"" she said. ""It is a challenging time, but that does not mean that this transition is not moving forward.""

The federal discount was designed to encourage drivers to go electric. In ending the credit, Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration argued the government shouldn't place its thumb on automobile markets in favor of one type of vehicle over another.

In Massachusetts, staff at some local dealerships said they've seen an increase in interest and sales of EVs in recent weeks, as consumers try to take advantage of the credit before the looming Sept. 30 deadline. Some dealerships' websites feature online countdown clocks until the credit expires.

Nationally, EV sales are also up. Last month, more than 145,000 EVs were sold across the country and made up nearly 10% of all new vehicle sales, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. This quarter, the U.S. could hit an all-time record for EV sales, the report stated.

Despite the “mad rush” to use the tax credit, EV sales will likely slow after it sunsets, said Christopher Knittel, professor of energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the university's Climate Policy Center.

In 2023, research out of MIT and Harvard University projected that federal tax credits, combined with efforts to install charging stations on highways nationwide, would increase EV adoption by 18% through the end of the decade. Knittel suspects customers could turn away from the EV without the financial incentive program.

“ Those are customers that are buying it because the tax credit exists, and if you pull it away, they're gonna go back to the internal combustion engine vehicle,” Knittel said.

Taking away the tax credits could reduce the number of EV sales through the end of the decade by around 6%, according to updated models from the Harvard and MIT team.

Massachusetts needs residents to register 900,000 EVs by the end of this decade in order to meet its climate change target. Last year, officials reported 140,000 EVs were on the state's roads. That pace of EV adoption has to increase for the state to meet its goal, Vanderspek said.

A Massachusetts-funded EV rebate program will still be available after the federal tax credit ends. The state incentive provides up to $3,500 for eligible vehicles. And Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers are eligible for a $6,500 credit. Some low-income households can also qualify for an additional $1,500.

Lauren Diggin, spokesperson for the state Department of Energy Resources, said staff works to ensure the rebate program ""operates as cost-effectively as possible to support broad adoption of EVs, and to better support increased adoption among disadvantaged communities, which are disproportionately impacted by harmful transportation emissions.""

The state will continue to help residents looking to purchase an EV ""as the Trump administration dismantles federal programs that support affordable clean vehicles,"" she said.

The federal tax credit has income eligibility limits and requirements for vehicles to qualify. The IRS also clarified last month that as long as a buyers sign a sales contract and make a payment before Sept. 30, they can qualify for the credit even if their car is delivered after the deadline.

Consumers can also take advantage of lower monthly payments on leased EVs through the expiring tax credit. They count as commercial vehicles, so there's a wider range of qualifying cars and the person leasing doesn't need to meet the income requirements that buyers do. Dealerships claim a commercial tax credit and often pass savings onto consumers.

Whether buyers get the tax credit when they buy a car or when they file their taxes, Vanderspek said to make sure and get a “time of sale” report from the dealership within three days of purchase. That will allow buyers to prove their purchase happened before the deadline.

The other driver of EV sales, charging stations, seem to be back on track. The Trump administration resumed a federal charging infrastructure program in August after freezing its funding for months, but research suggests that won't make up for the loss of individual discounts.

Knittel sees potential for the state continue its work on charging infrastructure, which could encourage more EV adoption without the cost of tax incentives. The Northeast has some of the highest density of public EV charging ports in the country, with Massachusetts topping the list, according to data from the nonprofit Climate Central.

Last month, state officials announced $46 million to add more charging infrastructure.

""Access to EV charging is essential if we’re serious about reducing emissions and developing a transportation system that’s resilient, fair, and prepared for the challenges of climate change,"" said state Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt in the announcement.

Still, shifts in federal climate policy — like a proposal to end the legal underpinning for tailpipe emissions standards — and uncertainty about tariffs could spell further uncertainty for the EV industry, as well as for consumers, Knittel said.

"" The most concerning thing to me is the yo-yo nature of climate policy at a federal level,” Knittel said. ""We've really gone into a world where we just have uncertain policy and that's gonna have much longer term impacts than what we're talking about today.""",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nepm-ev-1000x750.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 18:03:58.349179

Calling for a Billionaire Income Tax

On Wednesday, I introduced the Billionaire Income Tax Act(link is external) with my friend Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. We held a well-attended press conference in the Senate Finance Committee Room to explain how the measure would tax income from assets that, under current law, are not taxed until sold, while income from wages and salaries is taxed each paycheck. Later Wednesday, I spoke about the measure and about recent statements by Pope Leo on his concerns about income inequality from the House floor(link is external). I also entered a statement in the Congressional Record quoting Pope Leo’s remarks. See that here(link is external).

Questioning FBI Director Kash Patel about Operation Viper and the National Guard in Memphis

FBI Director Kash Patel testified at a Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Wednesday, and I took the opportunity to commend Operation Viper, the FBI initiative that works with local law enforcement in Memphis, to reduce crime. I also said the temporary deployment of the National Guard, which doesn’t have law enforcement training, was unlikely to make our community safer but will affect tourism, restaurant, construction and other industries. See a release with my exchange with Director Patel here(link is external).

Introducing Safe Streets for All Act

On Thursday, I introduced the Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Reauthorization and Improvement Act with Congressmen Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Robert Garcia of California. The legislation aims to reduce traffic accidents by supporting projects protecting pedestrians, cyclists, scooter-riders, motorists and transit riders. This is an important and successful program from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I am working to ensure it continues. See details about the measure here(link is external).

Meeting with Memphis Constituent Groups

This week, I met with several constituent groups including members of the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, University of Memphis President Bill Hardgrave and officials with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – Memphis District, Head Start, the Port of Memphis and the Auto Care Association, including AutoZone, in my Washington office to discuss their legislative priorities. These meetings are helpful in shaping my approach to voting, and I always welcome the opportunity to talk with constituents from Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District to my Washington office.

Calling for Independent Congressional Redistricting

On Wednesday, I introduced the John Tanner and Jim Cooper Fairness and Independence in Redistricting (FAIR) Act to require states to remove politics from their congressional apportionment practices and establish independent redistricting commissions. The measure is named for two former Tennessee congressmen who championed an end to partisan gerrymandering. Read about the measure here(link is external).

Meeting with Russian Dissident Journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza

On Thursday, the Russian political dissident, journalist and recently released political prisoner Vladimir Kara-Murza and his wife Evgenia visited my Washington office to talk about the war in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s corruption and the plight of Russian political prisoners. Kara-Murza, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 2024 while in prison, was released in a prisoner exchange last year. He is a true hero. As the Special Representative on Political Prisoners for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly, I discouraged Vladimir’s return to Russia in 2022 and worked diligently to keep his illegal detention in the headlines until he was released.

Denouncing Apparent Censoring of Trump Critics

ABC yanked late night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air on Wednesday citing some innocuous comments he made about the MAGA movement and its reaction to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. This follows CBS’s decision to cancel late night host Stephen Colbert in a transparent attempt to muzzle any criticism of Trump and his administration. These decisions, made while each broadcaster’s ownership companies are awaiting government approvals for multi-billion-dollar mergers, smack of government censorship in an age of fear and must be loudly and passionately condemned. As a democracy, we have a long tradition of criticizing public and elected officials, and the First Amendment guarantees that free speech. I spoke about this issue on the floor Thursday night which you can see here(link is external), and I cosponsored a resolution to condemn these attacks on free speech.

Reintroducing the Equal Employment for All Act

Credit scores should not be used in making hiring or firing decisions. On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and I reintroduced the Equal Employment for All Act to prohibit this practice. Read about it here(link is external).

Introducing the Aviation Funding Stability Act

With another Republican-caused government shutdown looming, I have introduced the Aviation Funding Stability Act with Congressman Andre Carson of Indiana. The measure would allow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to keep all of its programs running and all of its employees working by drawing from its Airports and Airways Trust Fund during any lapse in typical government appropriations. The current temporary budget agreement ends September 30. See my release on the measure here(link is external).

Announcing $3.4 Million in NIH Grants to UTHSC

On Monday, I announced two National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) totaling $3,409,508. Read about them here(link is external) and here(link is external).

Meeting with Eastern Orthodox Archbishop Bartholomew

Also Wednesday, I welcomed Archbishop Bartholomew of Constantinople, the leader of Eastern Orthodox Christians, at a luncheon hosted by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Bartholomew is making an official apostolic visit to the United States, where he will receive the prestigious Templeton Prize given to those who use their influence to explore deep questions about the universe and mankind’s purpose. Previous winners have been the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Archbishop Bartholomew’s longtime effort to promote coexistence with all the world’s religions is an inspiration.

Urging the EPA to Maintain its Endangerment Finding on Air Pollution

On Monday, I wrote(link is external) to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin seeking a reversal of a proposal to rescind the agency's 2009 Endangerment Finding which acknowledges that climate change has an impact on human health and safety. The Trump Administration is beholden to the fossil fuels industry. Denying climate change doesn’t change what everyone can see.

VPPs connect small energy systems and smart devices into a single network managed by an energy company or utility. That can include residential solar panels, battery storage, EVs, and smart thermostats. When the grid needs help during peak demand or emergencies, they can be tapped – and you get paid for participating.

Wood Mackenzie’s “2025 North America Virtual Power Plant Market” report shows that the market is expanding more broadly than deeply. The number of company deployments, unique buyers (offtakers), and market and utility programs each grew by more than 33% in the past year. But total capacity grew at a slower pace – just under 14%. “Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie.

Residential VPP customers are gaining ground

Residential customers are making a bigger dent in wholesale market capacity, increasing their share to 10.2% from 8.8% in 2024. But small customers still face roadblocks, mainly due to limits on data access for enrollment and market settlement.

Battery storage and EVs are also playing a bigger role. Deployments that include batteries or EVs now account for 61% as many as those that include smart thermostats, which have long dominated VPP programs.

Leading states and markets

California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are leading the pack, making up 37% of all VPP deployments. In wholesale markets, PJM (which manages the electric grid for 13 states and DC) and ERCOT (the Texas grid), both home to massive data center commitments, also have the highest disclosed VPP offtake capacity. “While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” Hertz-Shargel said.

Offtake growth and new business models

The top 25 VPP offtakers each procured more than 100 megawatts this year. Over half of all offtakers expanded their deployments by at least 30% compared to last year. That’s fueling the rise of a new “independent distributed power producer” model, where companies aim to use grid service revenue and energy arbitrage to finance third-party-owned storage for electricity retailers.

Policy pushback

Not everyone is on board with how utilities are approaching distributed energy resources (DERs). Many VPP aggregators and software providers oppose utilities putting DERs into their rate base under the Distributed Capacity Procurement model.* “This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third-party-owned resources,” Hertz-Shargel explained. He added that most wholesale market experts believe FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and won’t significantly improve market access.

*I really like this model, personally. I leased two Tesla Powerwalls under Green Mountain Power’s Lease Energy Storage program in Vermont for $55 a month, and it’s an excellent VPP program that’s grown much more rapidly than other models, such as bring-your-own batteries.

Steps to Take Now Plan with the deadline in mind: Review project timelines to confirm construction begins before June 30, 2026.
Final Word The construction start date is more than just a project milestone, it’s the gatekeeper to one of the most valuable tax deductions available today.
With the One Big Beautiful Bill sunsetting §179D on June 30, 2026, acting now ensures your project is on the right side of the deadline.","On July 4, 2025, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, a landmark piece of legislation that expanded the §179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction into one of the most powerful tax incentives available to building owners and designers. But this opportunity won’t last forever. The program sunsets on June 30, 2026. That means only buildings that start construction prior to this date will be eligible to claim the deduction.

After the deadline, the door to significant tax savings through §179D closes for projects that have not yet started.

Why Construction Start Date Matters

The construction start date is purely about eligibility. It does not determine which energy-efficiency standard applies. Instead, it’s the deciding factor for whether your project can claim the deduction at all.

Start before June 31, 2026 → Eligible to pursue up to $5.81 per square foot in deductions.

Start after June 31, 2026 → Not eligible, no matter how efficient the building becomes.

How the IRS Defines “Start of Construction”

The IRS recognizes construction through the use of 2 methodologies:

Method 1: Physical Work Test

Significant physical work on site is performed such as foundation work, plumbing, vertical construction, etc.…

This does not include site clearing, planning, design, permitting, etc..

Method 2: Safe Harbor

Incur 5% of the total cost of the facility. Additionally, work must be continuous.

In both cases, proper documentation of these activities is essential to demonstrate compliance with the eligibility cutoff.

What This Means for Owners and Designers

Building Owners: Beginning construction before June 30, 2026 locks in eligibility and ensures the opportunity to capture six- and seven-figure tax savings. Waiting too long could mean missing out entirely.

Eligible Designers: For architects, engineers, and contractors working on government or tax-exempt projects, starting construction before the deadline is the only way to receive an allocation of the deduction.

Steps to Take Now

Plan with the deadline in mind: Review project timelines to confirm construction begins before June 30, 2026.

Document thoroughly: Keep dated photos, contracts, and invoices to prove when significant work started.

Engage your advisors: Tax consultants and energy modelers can provide guidance and prepare the necessary reports and allocation letters.

Final Word

The construction start date is more than just a project milestone, it’s the gatekeeper to one of the most valuable tax deductions available today.

With the One Big Beautiful Bill sunsetting §179D on June 30, 2026, acting now ensures your project is on the right side of the deadline.

This follows building speculation in recent months that these designations would be revoked. The decision was confirmed in briefs filed on September 17, 2025, by the Department of Justice in the D.C. Circuit Court on behalf of EPA.

Presumably in response to pending legal challenges that the designation process for PFOA and PFOS under CERCLA section 102(a) was scientifically and legally flawed, EPA further announced it will pursue future rulemaking to establish a ""uniform framework"" governing the designation of any future hazardous substances under CERCLA. Beyond this, EPA Administrator Zeldin said ""new statutory language from Congress to fully address our concerns"" with CERCLA's liability provisions is necessary.

“Kids want the EPA to preserve the endangerment finding to protect our health and future,” said 12-year-old Valencia, who lives in Maryland.
The EPA determined at that time that the evidence was clear, and formalized the endangerment finding in 2009.
“The EPA couldn’t disapprove and deny the connection between greenhouse gases and climate change then, and they can’t now,” Markey told the audience.
“If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA,” Rogers, a former judicial clerk, told ICN.","School-age children carrying signs reading “less pollution, more solution” and “people over polluters” gathered on Wednesday inside the U.S. Capitol to oppose the Trump administration’s plan to roll back greenhouse gas regulations.

Congressional leaders and climate advocates joined the youth at the press conference, where they denounced the Environmental Protection Agency’s move to reconsider the landmark 2009 endangerment finding, the backbone of emissions regulation.

The backdrop of young faces underscored a point lawmakers and experts repeated throughout the event: that the debate is not just over statutory interpretation, science or judicial precedent. Repeal of the endangerment finding stands to fundamentally reshape the lives of young people, who will bear the brunt of climate change.

“Kids want the EPA to preserve the endangerment finding to protect our health and future,” said 12-year-old Valencia, who lives in Maryland. “Our generation is expected to live through three times as many climate disasters as our grandparents, and we’re already living through them.”

Holding aloft hand-drawn posters with messages like “climate change makes camp unsafe,” the kids described how environmental issues were already constraining the fun of their childhood. “My swim practices have gotten canceled because of wildfire smoke and recess gets moved inside when it’s too hot outside,” Margot, a 10-year-old from Virginia, told the crowd. “It’s really scary.”

Several lawmakers present reflected on their own childhoods, before pollution was reined in by the environmental policies now in the administration’s crosshairs. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) recalled “feeling that burning sensation in your eyes or in your throat because air quality was so bad.” He recounted how, growing up in Los Angeles in the 1970s, children had to stay home from school and avoid playing outdoors because of air pollution levels. “If you truly don’t believe in the power of cleaner vehicle standards, then think about these kids,” Padilla said.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) grounded the fight in history. His state argued, in Massachusetts v. EPA nearly two decades ago, that greenhouse gases were air pollutants and therefore must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court agreed in its 2007 ruling, which compelled the EPA to determine, based on scientific evidence, whether emissions posed a serious threat to public health. The EPA determined at that time that the evidence was clear, and formalized the endangerment finding in 2009. It vested the agency with the authority—and the legal obligation—to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

“The EPA couldn’t disapprove and deny the connection between greenhouse gases and climate change then, and they can’t now,” Markey told the audience. “We have the facts on our side—Trump’s EPA is pushing its own fictions.”

Markey’s comments were backed up the same day by a publication from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that will be submitted to the EPA. Authors of the new report from the nation’s premier group of scientific advisers reviewed the wealth of studies amassed by the scientific community since the endangerment finding was released, concluding that the evidence that emissions endanger human health is “beyond scientific dispute” and “has only grown stronger.”

“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” the report said, drawing on some 600 studies published in the past 16 years. Those newly identified threats include climate change’s impact on metabolic disease, antimicrobial resistance, immune health, nutrition, mental health, pregnancy and birth outcomes, the scientists wrote. “The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today’s extremes become tomorrow’s norms,” their report said.

The National Academies report is one of the more important documents to emerge in the brief public comment period that the EPA provided. That’s because Congress spelled out, in the Clean Air Act, that the agency should draw on the findings, recommendations and comments of the private, nonprofit institution, which operates under a 1863 congressional charter, signed by President Abraham Lincoln. Typically, the Academies write reports in response to requests from Congress or administrations, but in this case, no such request was made. The organization decided to self-fund a rapid response review of the science, completing it in just over 40 days.

Markey likened Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA head, to the mayor in the 1975 film “Jaws,” who keeps the town’s lucrative beaches open for swimming despite evidence of shark attacks and warnings from experts. “He’s trying to tell the American people, it’s all clear to get back in the water. Nothing to see here, folks. No danger from climate change. No laws that require him to fight pollution. No court precedent that demands the agency he leads must keep us safe.”

“We know that people are not safe; there’s blood in the water and more fossil fuel sharks than ever,” Markey added. “This attack on the endangerment finding is a clear and present danger to the public.”

In the 16 years since the endangerment finding, it was challenged numerous times by industry groups and their allies, but courts consistently upheld the EPA’s finding as “unambiguously correct.” Now, the Trump administration is moving to overturn years of precedent in just a few months.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said the EPA’s decision was the result of infiltration by the fossil fuel industry. Whitehouse described how the parasitoid wasp injects other bugs with its larva, which then controls the victim insect from the inside. “The Trump EPA is the bug and the fossil fuel larvae are in there, driving all of its decisions,” Whitehouse said.

Whitehouse announced an investigation Tuesday into whether the EPA’s decision had been shaped by industry groups. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding … played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal,” Whitehouse wrote in a formal request for documents from 24 companies and organizations.

Zeldin announced the plan to rescind the Endangerment Finding on July 29, promising to “end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.” If successful, the move could repeal all emissions standards for vehicles and end the reporting programs that track emissions data.

The announcement provoked immediate and significant public backlash.

During the first day of public hearings on the EPA’s proposal, Inside Climate News counted only 10 people who testified in support out of roughly 200 speakers. The overwhelming majority expressed deep concern over the decision’s potential consequences to human health, environment and industry.

The EPA extended the deadline for public input until Sept. 22, and the agency’s docket has now drawn more than 100,000 comments. Federal law requires that the EPA respond to significant comments before issuing any rule and incorporate the substance of those comments into the final regulation.

If the public fails to shift the EPA’s course, litigation will become inevitable, according to Kathleen Rogers, president of environmental advocacy group EarthDay.org. “If the endangerment finding is overturned, all the environmental groups will come together in bringing a case against the EPA,” Rogers, a former judicial clerk, told ICN. “It’ll go to the Supreme Court either way.” The National Academies report undoubtedly will be used as evidence in the legal challenges.

Rogers said the EPA would ultimately be asking the Supreme Court to overturn its own precedent. However, Rogers said it was “concerning” that three of the justices who, in 2007, wrote dissenting opinions in Massachusetts v. EPA—Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito—are still on the court today. “The Supreme Court ruling against itself isn’t that unprecedented anymore,” Rogers said. “Presidential power has become everything.”

The Trump administration based its justification for dismantling the endangerment finding on a U.S. Department of Energy report that downplayed the danger of climate change and argued that mitigating its effects could be more harmful than helpful. The report, which was widely discredited and dismissed by the scientific community—was penned by the administration’s since-disbanded Climate Working Group, composed of five prominent skeptics of the scientific consensus on climate change.

The Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit accusing the Climate Working Group of violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates transparency and balanced consideration from such bodies. President Trump insisted the group was exempt from those rules, but on Wednesday, a federal court rejected that argument.

“This Court rules that the Climate Working Group was not assembled to ‘exchange facts or information’ in a manner that would bring it into the claimed exception,” the order read, opening the path for the legal challenge to advance.

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) highlighted Wednesday how long environmental regulation had enjoyed bipartisan support. “I’m here to praise Richard Nixon for creating the EPA and the Clean Air Act. I’m here to praise Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, whose leadership recognized that global pollution demands global solutions,” Casten said, adding that Zeldin had a duty to administer the policies established by the courts and Congress.

“If he doesn’t do that, he’s breaking the law. He’s breaking his oath, and he is putting every one of us in jeopardy,” Casten added.

Reese Wilkerson, a 15-year-old from Maryland, was among the last to speak before the group of children and advocates left to visit the EPA, where they delivered hundreds of letters, from people across the country, opposing the agency’s regulatory rollback. “To every adult listening today, who cares about children now and who cares about our lives in the future, we are asking you to please protect the endangerment finding—and our future.”

Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. Not one is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

The average price of a new car in the U.S. hovers at $49,100, nearly a third higher than it was in summer 2019. The average EV price is higher still, $8,000 above that of the industry at-large, according to Cox Automotive.

Much of the recent auto inflation can be tied to options and add-ons. During the peak of the pandemic-related supply chain crunch, auto executives had trouble getting enough parts, so they put what little they could find into more expensive, lavish vehicles. In many ways, they never looked back.

Last year, the average car sold for one-third more than the average starting price. Most buyers either didn’t want bare-bones base models or couldn’t find them.

But some EV makers see a change ahead. At Slate’s launch event, Chief Executive Officer Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs.

“The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.

A blank Slate

Every year, AutoPacific, an industry consultancy, asks car shoppers what features they need. For those looking to spend under $35,000, the list is short. Generally, budget-conscious drivers are willing to splurge for safety features and apathetic when it comes to leather seats, head-up displays and advanced driver-assistance systems.

None of this is lost on Slate. The company’s truck, which it plans to deliver late next year, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, ambient lighting, cooled seats, air conditioning, all-wheel drive, a stereo and virtually any kind of driver-assistance.

“You could say we took out everything that wasn’t a car,” Barman said at the launch event.

What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s, before any incentives. By Slate’s reckoning, the market is sizable. In America, we love our trucks, but only about one-third of U.S. truck owners tow regularly. We love our road trips, but on average only drive about 30 miles a day.

While roughly 163,000 Americans buy small pickups in a typical year, the potential market for Slate’s EV expands when considering the 4.3 million people who buy a small SUV or the 1.2 million or so who drive off in a compact or subcompact car.

Would-be buyers can also purchase add-ons including speakers, a spare tire, or a kit that converts the truck to an SUV. Buyers can also add accessories in the years after their initial purchase, creating what the company hopes will be a long-tail revenue source.

Detroit reacts

Still, AutoPacific Chief Analyst Ed Kim sees Slate challenged on two fronts. Those considering the startup’s entry-level configuration may instead spring for a used truck that will offer far more features and niceties for the same price. And those considering a higher-end Slate may instead spend their money on a new machine from an established carmaker — say, the Ford Maverick, a pickup that starts around $27,000.

Ford, which dominates the market for full-size pickups, announced plans in August to make a mid-size electric truck that will sell for about $30,000, as well as a battery-powered SUV that will start below $40,000.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company was making a “tremendous pivot” to more affordable EVs. “This is a Model T moment for the company,” he told analysts, invoking a car whose price point put Ford on the map and made automobiles ubiquitous in America.

Toyota Motor Corp., whose Tacoma has long outsold every mid-size pickup on the market, is eyeing the tiny-truck market as well. The current Tacoma starts just shy of $32,000; if the company rolls out a smaller rig for less money, it will add yet another option for budget-conscious buyers.

Most Americans say they’re EV inclined. While battery-powered cars account for only about 1 in 10 new cars sales, almost 60% of shoppers say they are “very” or “somewhat” likely to buy an electric vehicle, according to JD Power.

Price is one of the obstacles, a speed bump the Trump administration made bigger when the president signed a tax law that will eliminate federal incentives for battery-powered cars and trucks. Without up to $7,500 purchase tax credits, EVs are expected to be just 27% of the market in 2030, down from nearly half had the incentives stayed in place, according to BloombergNEF’s projections.

Still, BNEF expects electric cars to be as cheap or cheaper than gas versions by around 2028. Even if they won’t help bridge the expected EV sales gap, cheaper models from Slate and Ford could help spur adoption after federal incentives disappear.

Derek Dufon, a 48-year-old architect in Iowa, put down a $50 deposit on a Slate hours after its reveal. Dufon doesn’t need much in the way of luxuries, just space to haul drawings and building materials to job sites and programmable air conditioning for Henry, his boxer-hound mutt.

“It would be great for work,” Dufon says of the truck. “And I’ve got an old house, so there’s always a project going on with that.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7d890b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F96%2Fb5ba57a064e4344954e2034f6a48%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 17:02:04.808511

Wireless Power Transmission Systems

In recent years, wireless power transmission technologies for devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, drones, and electric vehicles, which can supply electricity without using cables, have garnered increasing attention. There are two types of wireless power transmission systems: one uses microwaves and the other uses laser beams. Microwave wireless power transmission is already in practical use and its use is expanding. On the other hand, optical wireless power transmission using laser beams has not been put into practical use, but it is expected to realize compact long-distance wireless power transmission on the order of kilometers by taking advantage of the high directivity of laser beam technology.

Future prospects envision the development of next-generation infrastructure capable of supplying power and expanding communication coverage in situations and regions where electricity or communication networks are unavailable, such as during disasters, on remote islands, mountainous areas, or at sea. This includes delivering power precisely to specific areas or moving platforms such as drones. Achieving such highly accurate and long-distance power delivery requires laser-based wireless power transmission that takes advantage of its strong directionality.

Existing Technology Challenges and Achievements of This Experiment

The efficiency of optical wireless power transmission technology is generally low, and improvement of efficiency is an issue for practical use. One of the reasons for this is that when a long-distance laser beam propagates, especially in the atmosphere, the intensity distribution becomes uneven, and the efficiency of converting the laser beam into electric power in the photoelectric conversion element becomes low.

In this experiment, researchers combined NTT’s beam-shaping technology with MHI’s light-receiving technology to improve the efficiency of laser wireless power transmission. The team conducted a long-distance optical wireless power transmission experiment in an outdoor environment using long-distance flat beam shaping technology that shaped the beam at the transmission side to achieve uniform beam intensity after one kilometer propagation, and output current leveling technology that suppresses the influence of atmospheric fluctuations with a homogenizer and leveling circuits on the receiving side.

From January to February 2025, MHI conducted an optical wireless power transmission experiment on a runway at the Nanki-Shirahama Airport in Shirahama Town, Nishimuro District, Wakayama Prefecture (Figure 2). A transmission booth equipped with an optical system for emitting the laser beam was installed at one end of the runway, and a reception booth containing a light-receiving panel was placed one kilometer away.

During transmission, the optical axis of the laser was set at a low height of approximately one meter above the ground and aligned horizontally. As a result, the beam was strongly affected by ground heating and wind, and the experiment was conducted under conditions with strong atmospheric turbulence.

Inside the transmission booth, a laser beam with an optical power of 1,035 W was generated. Using a diffractive optical element (DOE), the beam was shaped to create a uniform intensity distribution at a distance of one kilometer. In addition, a beam steering mirror was used to precisely direct the shaped beam toward the receiving panel. The beam exited through the aperture of the transmission booth and propagated across one kilometer of open space, ultimately reaching the reception booth.

During propagation, atmospheric turbulence caused fluctuations in the beam’s intensity, creating hot spots. These were diffused by a homogenizer in the reception booth, resulting in a uniform beam being irradiated onto the receiving panel. The laser beam was then efficiently converted into electrical power (Figure 3). A silicon-based photoelectric conversion element was adopted for the receiving panel, taking into account both cost and availability.

In this experiment, the average electrical power extracted from the receiving panel was 152 W (Figure 4), corresponding to a wireless power transmission efficiency of 15%, defined as the ratio of received electrical power to transmitted optical power. This result marks the world’s highest optical wireless power transmission efficiency ever demonstrated using a silicon-based photoelectric conversion element under conditions of strong atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, continuous power delivery was successfully maintained for 30 minutes, confirming the feasibility of long-duration power transmission using this technology.

From a safety perspective, the optical transmission system and the receiving panel were each installed inside booths to prevent accidental exposure to high-power laser beams and the scattering of reflected light.

Technical Highlights

Long-Distance Flat Beam Shaping Technology. To improve photoelectric conversion efficiency, it is necessary to make the intensity distribution of the beam incident on the photoelectric conversion element uniform. In this study, MHI proposed a beam shaping method that enables intensity uniformity after long-distance propagation. In this approach, the outer part of the beam is transformed into a ring-shaped pattern using the effect of an axicon lens. The central part of the beam is phase-modulated to expand through the effect of a concave lens. As the beam propagates, the ring-shaped beam and the expanded central beam gradually overlap, resulting in a uniform intensity distribution at the target location, as shown in Figure 5.

For the experiment, MHI optimized the beam design to achieve the desired intensity profile at a distance of one kilometer. The beam shaping was implemented using a diffractive optical element, which improved the uniformity of the beam intensity at the target position located one kilometer away.

Output Current Leveling Technology. As the laser beam propagates through the atmosphere, it is affected by atmospheric turbulence, which disturbs the intensity distribution. Although the flat-beam shaping technique described above can make the intensity distribution more uniform, strong turbulence can still cause the formation of high-intensity spots, as shown in Figure 6.

To address this issue, MHI placed a beam homogenizer in front of the light-receiving panel. The homogenizer diffused high-intensity spots so that the beam was uniformly irradiated onto the panel. In addition, leveling circuits were connected to each photoelectric conversion element on the receiving panel. These circuits helped suppress fluctuations in output current caused by atmospheric turbulence and contributed to a more stabilize overall power output.

These two technologies make it possible to achieve beam uniformity in kilometer-order transmission, which was difficult with conventional beam shaping methods, and to stabilize output in outdoor environments. As a result, stable power supply to remote locations such as isolated islands and disaster-affected areas is expected to become feasible.

Company Roles and the Path Forward

NTT focused on the design and implementation of transmission optics such as beam-shaping techniques. Meanwhile, MHI managed the design and implementation of photodetector optics such as photodetector panels, homogenizers, and leveling circuits.

This technology enables the efficient and stable transmission of energy over long distances even under atmospheric turbulence. In this experiment, silicon was used as the photovoltaic conversion element. However, by employing photovoltaic devices specifically designed to match the wavelength of the laser light, even higher power transfer efficiency can be expected. In addition, the use of laser light sources with higher output power would make it possible to supply larger amounts of electricity.

As a result, flexible and rapid power delivery can be achieved in remote areas such as disaster-stricken regions and remote islands, where the installation of power cables has traditionally been difficult. Beyond terrestrial applications, a wide range of new use cases can also be envisioned based on this technology (Figure 7). Notably, the high directivity and low divergence of laser beams allow for the design of compact and lightweight receiving devices. This is a major advantage for mobile platforms that face strict limitations in weight and payload capacity.

For example, by combining this technology with beam steering techniques, it becomes possible to deliver power wirelessly to drones in flight. This avoids operational constraints such as landing for battery replacement or the use of tethered power supply cables, enabling long-duration and long-distance continuous operation. Such capabilities can enhance disaster-area monitoring as well as wide-area communication relay in mountainous or maritime regions, applications that were previously difficult to realize.

In addition, potential applications in space are anticipated, including power delivery to mobile platforms such as HAPS (High-Altitude Platform Station), which falls within the scope of NTT’s space brand, NTT C89. Looking further ahead, the technology could be applied to power space data centers and lunar rovers, as well as to space solar power systems in which electricity is transmitted from geostationary satellites to the ground via laser. These applications represent areas with strong potential for market expansion.

Through the collaboration between NTT and MHI, the companies have realized the world’s most efficient laser wireless power transfer technology under conditions strongly affected by atmospheric fluctuations. This achievement represents a significant step toward building an innovative technological foundation that can meet a wide range of societal needs, from disaster response to space development.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fig7-use-cases-laser-power-transmission.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:04:34.213037

Introduction

The impact of climate change has intensified worldwide, disproportionately affecting communities in the Global South, despite their limited contributions to historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Countries across the Global South must address rising climate challenges while balancing broader development goals such as economic growth, job creation, and trade enhancement. In fast-growing regions like India and Africa, where urban populations and energy demands are expanding rapidly, embedding sustainability into economic planning is essential for long-term prosperity. Recognizing this, policymakers are integrating energy security with low-emission technologies not only to meet climate targets, but also to foster economic progress by strengthening the local manufacturing and service sectors to create more local employment opportunities.

The transportation sector is central to the transition. It is both a critical enabler of economic activities—connecting markets, driving trade, and facilitating the movement of people and goods—and a significant source of GHG emissions. Globally, the transportation sector is the third-largest CO2 emitter, with road transportation alone accounting for over 70 percent of the sector’s emissions. To address this, many countries are turning their focus toward decarbonizing transportation through the adoption of low-emission technologies, namely EVs. This shift can unlock major opportunities for economic development through reduced reliance on expensive and imported fuels, enhanced productivity due to improved air quality, and the creation of new manufacturing and employment opportunities.

Though countries like Norway and China are currently leading the EV transition, emerging economies in Africa and Asia are following suit. Many countries are already demonstrating sustained EV adoption, building momentum toward climate resilience, harnessing economic opportunities, and expanding employment.

With distinct economic and policy structures, resource availability, and social priorities throughout the Global South, the transition to low-emissions technologies will take many forms. This diversity presents a valuable pool of knowledge in policy design, financing, technology deployment, and supply chain integration. Strengthening collaboration across the Global South can facilitate the exchange of insights, foster joint innovation, and create foundations for integrated EV supply chains to accelerate the e-mobility transition. In addition, leveraging this collaboration and regional strengths will facilitate real commercial gains built on technological and financial innovation.

Moving toward innovative and cooperative approaches across the Global South, and away from the traditionally siloed efforts, can accelerate progress and advance both economic development and climate goals. This is particularly important for India and many countries across Africa that are well-positioned to harness complementary strengths in policy design, manufacturing, and innovation.

Benefits of Global South Cooperation

Countries in the Global South can seek to harness a range of benefits from increased collaboration:

Countries can develop bilateral and multilateral relationships underpinning commercial ties to build resilient EV supply chains—spanning critical minerals, vehicle components manufacturing, and assembly line development. This has the potential to unlock new markets and investment opportunities, enhancing regional economic growth and increasing employment.

Improved regional coordination mechanisms can facilitate the exchange of ideas, identify areas of cross-collaboration, and strengthen institutional measures for rapid EV deployment.

As countries continue to evolve their EV ecosystems, the exchange of best practices can lead to the development of nuanced policy frameworks that are better suited to local contexts by drawing lessons from countries with similar economic and infrastructure challenges. Facilitating the exchange of best practices enables countries to avoid costly missteps in their own EV transitions.

A robust platform for continued dialogue among partners in the Global South would enable policymakers and private sector stakeholders to identify opportunities to create sectoral partnerships, expand the field of knowledge, and support context-specific development and manufacturing solutions as domestic ecosystems mature.

Untapped Potential of India-Africa Collaboration

India and Africa have long shared close trade relations across key sectors, including automobiles, pharmaceuticals, education, and agriculture. Over the years, trade between India and Africa has increased substantially, from $68.5 billion in 2011–2012 to $83.3 billion in 2023–2024, making India the continent’s third-largest trading partner. India’s trade volume with Africa is expected to double to $200 billion by 2031, presenting a timely opportunity to deepen economic and technology partnerships.

India has been a frontrunner on the EV transition in the Global South, supported by strong policy leadership and an expanding manufacturing ecosystem. In contrast, many countries in Africa are in the early stages of building modern, low-carbon transportation systems. By building on their long-standing cooperation in the automobile sector and channeling it into the EV value chain, India and African countries can drive innovation, reduce costs, and lay the foundation for developing strong regional coordination mechanisms.

India’s national and state-level EV policy frameworks are designed to establish a robust EV value chain. These policies create a strong enabling environment that encourages demand creation, boosts manufacturing, and supports the expansion of EV charging infrastructure (EVCI). Africa, though at an early stage of EV adoption, has a unique opportunity to leapfrog conventional vehicles and go directly to EVs while expanding its own manufacturing ecosystem by drawing from India’s policy, manufacturing, and market development experiences.

India and African countries should accelerate Global South cooperation to address challenges on both the demand and supply sides of EV deployment, including economic, material, and market barriers. To realize these opportunities, the countries should cooperatively focus on:

Strengthening supply chain resilience for EV manufacturing and critical minerals;

Integrating advanced technologies and harmonizing policy frameworks;

Developing an investment-friendly ecosystem to drive sector growth;

Enabling skill development and technology localization; and

Creating knowledge-sharing platforms to accelerate sectoral learning

There is significant common ground between India and Africa in the EV sector, with India at a pivotal stage of scaling clean transportation and several African countries entering global EV supply chains. Considering their similar ground experiences and growth trajectories, the partnerships can focus particularly on electric two-wheelers (E2W), electric three-wheelers (E3W), e-buses, and battery technologies. African countries can become reliable supply chain partners for Indian EV manufacturers, while India offers valuable expertise to support Africa’s evolving market, particularly in manufacturing and policy design.

About This Paper

This paper aims to outline a strategic framework for strengthening Global South collaboration to accelerate the e-mobility transition, with a particular focus on fostering partnership between India and Africa. It examines how collaboration between India and African countries can be deepened, drawing on a defined country selection framework (see Framework for Partner Country Selection), which has identified four African countries for focused engagement with India in this initial phase of collaboration. However, the framework is flexible and can be expanded in subsequent phases to include additional African countries.

Realizing Collaboration Opportunities in Electric Mobility

As part of development strategies, countries are increasingly recognizing the benefits of adopting low-emission technologies, including reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, decreasing air pollution, and expanding local manufacturing ecosystems and jobs. E-mobility in particular plays a critical role in this transition due to its interlinkages with emissions reduction and economic development. Against this backdrop, India and several African countries are pursuing e-mobility, backed by clear policy intent and action plans. This section examines the present stage of the EV transition in India and Africa and identifies specific areas of collaboration to accelerate progress in the sector.

India’s E-mobility Transition

Transportation is one of India’s fastest-growing sectors, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9 percent. India is the fourth-largest automobile manufacturer in the world, and the sector contributes 7.1 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 49 percent to its manufacturing GDP. Alongside industrial output, job creation and global trade are cornerstones of this sector in India. However, the transportation sector is also the country’s second-largest CO2 emitter, with road transportation alone accounting for more than 90 percent of those emissions. India is at a crossroads, trying to balance pursuing its economic and development goals while also reducing its emissions intensity as outlined in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets. To reduce the transportation sector’s emissions, which are projected to double by 2050, India is making significant strides to electrify the sector and shift toward low-emissions technologies.

India is expected to add 80 million EVs on the road under the government’s EV target, which aims for 30 percent of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. To facilitate this transition, the Indian government, as well as 30 subnational governments, have introduced or are in the process of introducing demand-side and supply-side incentives aimed at promoting EV adoption, streamlining charging infrastructure, enhancing local manufacturing, and creating jobs.

In addition, fiscal incentives from the central government have evolved as described in Table 2. The most recent tranche comes from the 2024 launch of the PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme, with an initial outlay of $1.3 billion to incentivize the purchase of various type of EVs, charging infrastructure, and automobile testing facilities. Through consistent policy support and financial incentives, the EV sector in India has registered exponential progress. Figure 2 shows the year-on-year increase in annual EV registrations (all categories) in India.

Changing Dynamics of India’s Automotive Sector

In tandem with the global transition, India’s automotive sector has shifted toward e-mobility, building on strong government backing and rapidly growing domestic innovation. Leading Indian original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Tata Motors, Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, and TVS have rolled out mass-market EVs such as passenger cars, E2Ws, E3Ws, and e-buses. Additionally, startups such as Ather Energy, Ola Electric, and SUN Mobility have continuously evolved to create tailored solutions for India’s changing mobility patterns.

The central and state governments of India have long supported this focus on e-mobility through various policies and schemes. Launched in January 2013, the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 (NEMMP-2020) laid the groundwork for key national programs such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles (FAME-I and FAME-II) schemes; Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI); Production Linked Incentives (PLI) for EVs, battery manufacturing, and critical minerals processing; and the PM E-DRIVE scheme. These central interventions have established a strong policy and financial framework, while much of the on-ground progress has been supported by proactive subnational policies. Many states have set up dedicated nodal agencies and designed region-specific incentives to address local priorities and accelerate EV adoption. States such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Gujarat are emerging as EV manufacturing hubs in India. At the same time, major investments are flowing into localized supply chains, including into battery gigafactories.

India’s EV Sector Challenges

While significant progress has been made in India’s EV transition, key challenges remain:

Insufficient charging infrastructure: As of April 2025, India had installed close to 26,000 public charging stations (PCSs). This translates to a ratio of only one PCS for every 235 EVs on the road. It is critically low when compared to the ratio of one charger for every 7 to 15 EVs in various European countries. Although schemes such as PM E-DRIVE and various subnational policies focus on the rapid installation of PCSs, momentum needs to be accelerated to alleviate range anxiety. Moreover, EVCI is unevenly distributed, further increasing range anxiety among potential EV consumers in both urban and rural areas. Focused, long-term planning is necessary to ensure that the charging needs of the emerging consumer base are addressed to offer easier access and convenience.

Supply chain vulnerability: The EV production ecosystem needs to address supply chain-related issues and vulnerabilities. Specifically, the sector heavily relies on imports for battery components, among other critical parts, and is constantly affected by global supply chain disruptions. While a robust local manufacturing ecosystem is required, India should explore strengthening supply chains through sourcing raw materials from reliable partners. Additionally, India has the opportunity to electrify the largest diesel-consuming segments of the economy: trucking and agriculture. To do so, India must continue to build international strategic partnerships, emphasize domestic reliance to build robust supply chains, and enable innovation to reduce costs and enhance overall trust in the sector.

Lack of technology standardization: EVCI, battery chemistries, and technology are still evolving. Charging connectors need to be standardized to enable interoperability and to ensure that the limited number of PCSs available can be utilized more efficiently.

Workforce limitations: The limited availability of a skilled workforce is another challenge that needs to be addressed. Mechanisms to train and upskill the workforce currently associated with the traditional automotive industry, as well as building a new workforce, need to match the pace of the expanding EV ecosystem.

Africa’s Evolving E-mobility Landscape

As a whole, Africa is experiencing rapid motorization, driven largely by the import of used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. While Africa’s EV market is nascent, countries across the continent are prioritizing the manufacturing and adoption of EVs, depending on existing infrastructure and resource availability. For instance, South Africa’s Comprehensive EV Roadmap focuses on manufacturing and localization of the value chain, leveraging the country’s existing automotive manufacturing value chain. Kenya, meanwhile, has drafted a National E-Mobility Policy that centers on domestic manufacturing and job creation. Nigeria’s energy transition plan aims to achieve 100 percent EV adoption by 2060, while Mauritius has developed a 10-year roadmap aiming to create favorable market conditions for EV adoption by 2030. In 2024, Ethiopia became the first country in the world to ban the import of ICE vehicles, paving the way for the electrification of transportation. The development of the EV sector in Africa, similar to India, remains intertwined with the economic objectives of job creation and infrastructure development.

Figure 3 illustrates the various levels of EV adoption readiness in Africa based on each country’s EV polices, incentives, grid reliability, and EVCI.

Africa’s Automotive Manufacturing Evolution

Africa’s automotive manufacturing sector has a long history, with many of the largest auto manufacturers—e.g., Toyota, Stellantis, and Renault—establishing major operations in Morocco and South Africa, though the majority of vehicles produced there are destined for the European Union. Indian manufacturers have also maintained a long-standing presence in Africa, including Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, and TVS Motor Company. A number of domestic OEMs in Africa have also emerged, including Kiira Motors in Uganda and Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM) in Nigeria, both focusing on domestic innovation and projects tailored to the local contexts.

Over the last decade, Africa’s automobile sector has shifted its focus toward the EV manufacturing ecosystem, leveraging investments from leading global automobile manufacturers in cooperation with many African governments. Multiple countries have introduced policies and incentives favorable to domestic EV manufacturing and have even pooled substantial resources to build an international EV ecosystem, including $54 million from South Africa and close to $100 million in public-private financing from Uganda. So far, 21 African countries have set up or are in the process of setting up EV manufacturing plants.

However, significant gaps persist in the local infrastructure needed to support the adoption of EVs across Africa. To address these challenges, many domestic startups are building solutions tailored to the African market, such as battery swapping and subscription-to-own models. The aim is to overcome barriers related to upfront investment costs, electricity reliability, and post-sale service. Moreover, some companies are locally designing and assembling E2Ws and E3Ws or retrofitting ICE 2Ws to better suit Africa’s road conditions and to reduce costs.

Bottlenecks to the EV Transition in Africa

There are several obstacles to Africa’s EV transition:

Prevalence of used ICE vehicles and the high cost of EVs: Used ICE vehicles dominate the four-wheeler (4W) passenger car market in Africa, constituting 85 percent of all sales. Without strong incentives, EVs struggle to achieve price competitiveness, discouraging growth and investment in EV manufacturing for domestic consumption. Deliberate policy design, such as Ethiopia’s ban on the import of ICE vehicles, can potentially shift market trends and address this concern.

Financing and capital constraints: Setting up and developing EV manufacturing and supply chains requires significant upfront investments, but rising financing costs are slowing the sector’s growth. The region faces a financial deficit in the range of $20–$25 billion per year to meet its industrialization and manufacturing goals, nearly half of the $50 billion the continent’s manufacturing sector requires annually, according to the African Development Bank. With potentially $9 billion in financing required by 2030 to advance a sustainable E2W market alone across Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ethiopia, local investors and financing institutions remain hesitant to support the sector due to early-stage risk aversion.

Insufficient electricity generation and grid reliability: Electricity demand consistently outpaces generation in Africa, with an estimated 43 percent of the population (over 600 million people) lacking access to reliable electricity as of 2022. Countries such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Nigeria struggle with inadequate power supplies despite massive investments in increasing electricity generation. This poses major obstacles to scaling up manufacturing and EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, African utilities consistently score poorly on grid efficiency and reliability, with high system inefficiencies and losses. As countries advance their EV goals, it is crucial that electricity infrastructure development and investment be prioritized to enhance electricity generation and grid reliability.

Lack of domestic manufacturing capacity and skilled workforce: Most countries in Africa lack both the infrastructure necessary to support local manufacturing and the skilled workforce required to run it. This poses significant barriers to scaling up EV manufacturing. While skilling remains a common challenge in India and Africa, international partnerships focusing on capacity building can help address this concern and provide a platform for more strategic dialogue among the countries.

The E-mobility Policy Landscapes in India and Africa

India’s EV policy landscape has advanced considerably over the past decade, shaped by a combination of national and subnational initiatives aimed at building a robust and self-sustaining e-mobility ecosystem. Africa’s EV policy landscape is still at an early stage, with efforts varying widely across countries depending on market readiness, infrastructure capacity, and national priorities. While a few African countries have introduced dedicated e-mobility policies or incentives, many others are integrating EV measures within broader transportation or energy strategies. Although the continent’s EV adoption remains nascent, growing commitment and urbanization trends provide a strong foundation for scaling the transition in the coming years.

This paper selected the top 10 countries in Africa based on largest GDP for the purpose of initial assessment: South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco, Ethiopia, Algeria, Tanzania, Angola, and Côte d’Ivoire. While South Africa and Nigeria have launched national plans, the others have more general frameworks focused on EV transition and emissions reduction.

Table 2 provides a broad overview of the national-level EV policies and frameworks from these countries, along with those in India, for seven broad categories. See appendix (Table 5) for more details on the different policies of the selected 10 African countries.

Realizing Opportunities to Advance the E-mobility Transition Through Collaboration

Historically, the automobile sector has been a key area of cooperation between India and Africa. Anchored in shared knowledge exchange, market development, and resource security, India and Africa have the opportunity to create a mutually beneficial framework for e-mobility. With different resources and stages of development, the two regions will need to play distinct roles through this cooperation.

India can perform several key actions to support Africa’s e-mobility goals:

Share policy and regulatory expertise. India has specific policy lessons to share through its established fuel consumption standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms, which ensure that manufacturers transition toward producing a more fuel-efficient fleet. With India’s example, African countries can address the challenge posed by the prevalence of ICE vehicles on the continent. Indian policymakers and industry can work with African partners to develop regulations for used vehicle imports, design incentives for EV adoption, and share lessons on achieving price parity through local innovation and economies of scale.

Support the development of financing models. Efforts to build local capacity and infrastructure are currently being driven by private international firms through blended finance mechanisms in Africa. India’s experience with tailored financing and risk-sharing tools can be leveraged to identify key opportunities to spur investments in domestic markets.

Draw lessons from the electricity sector. While electricity reliability and access are complex and multifaceted issues, there are myriad potential solutions specific to EV manufacturing in Africa. Solutions may comprise low-cost financing and subsidies for renewable energy for EV manufacturers or financing for battery-swapping pilot programs, both to scale charging infrastructure and to improve grid reliability. India’s experiences in the integration of distributed renewable energy and mini-grid solutions, as well as in piloting battery swapping and behind-the-meter storage, are extremely relevant to address these challenges, especially in developing scaled battery innovations and grid management solutions suited to local contexts in African nations.

Build skilling models. To upskill and reskill its workforce, India has established several skilling models through initiatives such as Skill India and a range of public-private partnerships. As the India-Africa partnerships on the manufacturing ecosystem evolve, knowledge exchange and skilling programs can be designed with both economic and manufacturing needs in mind to build local capacity.

Governments in Africa can likewise undertake several actions to facilitate e-mobility collaboration with India:

Enable diversified and value-added supply chains. India needs to strengthen its supply chains to establish and securely maintain a flourishing domestic EV manufacturing ecosystem. Africa is home to vast reserves of lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, all essential components of EV batteries. Beyond importing raw materials from Africa, Indian firms can play a proactive role in mineral and economic development by investing in sustainable mining, supporting local processing and refining capacities, and establishing joint ventures that can create stronger supply chains for both regions. This approach can help generate greater value domestically, build resilient regional supply chains, and produce benefits for both the African minerals sector and India’s EV industry.

Collaborate on battery recycling and circular economy models. India and many countries in Africa, including South Africa and Kenya, are considering the secondary use of batteries and establishing battery recycling ecosystems. These efforts present an incredible opportunity to collaborate on building circular economy frameworks that can meet battery demand for small-form factors (e.g., E2Ws and E3Ws) while also addressing electricity storage issues for many countries with abundant renewable energy potential.

Create innovation and opportunities to scale up. India’s automobile companies are already well-established in many African countries. The emerging EV market in Africa presents new opportunities to expand the existing consumer base or to enter local partnerships, particularly for players who already have a nuanced understanding of regional automobile markets. For India’s automobile sector, Africa’s emerging market not only provides scale but also will lead to lower costs and facilitate innovative production suitable for diverse conditions, benefiting consumers in both regions. At the same time, OEMs can invest in building local value chains, launch joint skilling initiatives, and create local employment opportunities.

Create partnerships for the ecosystem. By presenting a united Global South region at international forums, India and African countries can drive more equitable trade terms for critical minerals, promote open technology transfer, and push for increased funding and research. This collaborative approach can foster a more inclusive global EV future.

India and Africa are both at pivotal junctures in their e-mobility transitions—Africa with its strong policy intent to leapfrog ICE vehicles, and India with its goal to significantly scale up EV adoption. Considering evolving global trends, there are numerous opportunities to strengthen Global South coordination on e-mobility, including facilitating the exchange of ideas, expanding supply chains, and accelerating EV deployment across the region.

Framework for Partner Country Selection

India’s engagement with Africa on e-mobility marks a strategic opportunity for both regions to advance their economic and sustainability goals. This section outlines the framework adopted for selecting initial focus countries, providing a backdrop for collaboration between India and Africa. Subsequently, this framework can be expanded to include more countries and deepen cooperation across the Global South.

Country Selection Framework

The research team developed a comprehensive selection framework involving seven parameters to identify potential partner countries in Africa with which India can collaborate. While this framework offers an objective basis for the current assessment, it is important to note that the results may evolve as the parameters and underlying factors change. Under the initial phase, four African countries were identified, but the framework can be scaled and expanded to more countries in subsequent phases as the India-Africa partnership deepens.

The first step was to short-list countries based on GDP—a proxy for market size, consumer base, and infrastructure capacity—which can drive demand for EVs and related industries. The 10 countries short-listed for further assessment based on their GDP were South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco, Algeria, Tanzania, Angola, Ethiopia, and Côte d'Ivoire.

Each short-listed country was then evaluated for its EV readiness and its potential for partnership with India. The evaluation used seven quantifiable parameters, with data sourced from reputable international and government institutions to ensure objectivity and comparability.

Profiles for Short-Listed Countries

Based on the comprehensive selection framework, the top four countries short-listed for this phase of strengthening collaboration are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya. An overview of the current landscape of each country is provided below.

South Africa

South Africa is the largest automotive manufacturing hub in sub-Saharan Africa for global OEMs like Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen. Indian OEM Mahindra and Mahindra has been operating in South Africa for over three decades and signed an MOU in 2025 to explore auto manufacturing operations in the country. While no EVs are currently manufactured domestically, South Africa’s 2023 Electric Vehicle White Paper, from the country’s Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition (DTIC), focused on developing the EV industry.

E-mobility landscape: EVs have faced economic penalties in South Africa, facing a 25 percent import tariff, compared to 18 percent on ICE vehicles, making EVs less cost-competitive. However, the 2025 budget from the South Africa’s National Treasury introduced a $54 million incentive program to build domestic EV manufacturing. South Africa also plans to introduce a 150 percent tax incentive for electric and hydrogen vehicle production in March 2026. South African EV sales are growing rapidly, experiencing 80 percent growth in first-quarter sales in 2024 compared to 2023.

Climate goals and EV targets: South Africa’s climate goals, outlined in its 2021 NDC, highlight that greening transportation is a key component of its broader climate action framework. As part of the Paris Agreement, South Africa has a relatively modest non-binding commitment to achieve 20 percent hybrid or EV penetration by 2030.

The 2021 Auto Sector Green Paper on New Electric Vehicles, from South Africa’s DTIC, ties the country’s economic goals to climate imperatives in the domestic automotive industry. The paper prioritizes EVs to maintain access to key export markets and aims to boost EV adoption through a global framework such as the Electric Vehicle Initiative. The country has conditionally signed COP26’s zero emissions by 2040 vehicle declaration.

Key stakeholders: Collaboration and alignment among the key stakeholders in the South African automotive market is essential to drive the EV transition, with the government providing the policy framework and direction and the private sector bringing investment and technology.

The DTIC develops central auto industry policy and new legislation on EVs, while the National Treasury oversees the funds for EV incentives and tax measures. South Africa’s automotive industry, represented predominantly by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA), advocates for reduced import duties and transparent policies to encourage EV adoption (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Egypt

The most populous country in North Africa, Egypt has massive potential for EV growth and adoption. The Egyptian government has begun cultivating its EV industry through a mix of import policy, supply- and demand-side subsidies, and partnerships with foreign companies. Egypt has over 7,213 registered EVs as of 2024.

E-mobility landscape: Egypt offers several fiscal incentives related to e-mobility, including special import duty rates for EVs, charging stations, and components. The country has also introduced special electricity tariffs to reduce operational costs for EVs, although this rate has increased for public charging. Furthermore, Egypt has pushed for investments in startups, domestic manufacturing, and EV infrastructure. As a result, as of late 2024, the country was home to 19 automotive manufacturing plants, as well as the Suez Canal Economic Zone, an area to provide essential support to the industry. The country aims to produce 25,000 vehicles per year through an memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the state-owned El Nasr Automotive and Dongfeng Motor Group. In addition, the country entered a joint manufacturing scheme with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Bahrain, to build assembly lines in Egypt for the UAE’s M Glory Holding automotive manufacturer.

Climate goals and EVs: In 2022, Egypt released its National Climate Change Strategy 2050 and revised its NDC the following year. While its transportation focus is shifting from private passenger and freight vehicles to mass transit, the country is still making efforts to encourage the domestic manufacturing of EVs. Though Egypt does not have a set EV target, electrifying transportation aligns with its broader climate and emissions reduction strategies. Its NDC pledge is to reduce emissions in the transportation sector by 7 percent by 2030.

Key stakeholders: Egypt’s EV environment is governed by its line ministries, including the Ministry of Public Business Sector and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, through import policies—most notably the used car and EV import rules—and other industrial incentives (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Nigeria

Nigeria is a major oil producer and is heavily reliant on the import of used ICE vehicles. The country is committed to transitioning to cleaner vehicles, emphasized by its 2023 removal of historic fuel subsidies and its commitment to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2060.

E-mobility landscape: Since the successful repeal of historic fuel subsidies in 2023—which had been announced but not implemented in 2020, and only temporarily implemented in 2016—the Nigerian government has released several related reforms and incentives. The government eliminated all import tariffs on EVs in early 2024, compared to the 35 percent tariff on other vehicles, to increase the cost competitiveness of EVs. Nigeria’s Action Plan for Development of Electric Vehicles, issued in May 2023, delineates a strategy to facilitate domestic manufacturing of EVs, including several incentives for localized EV assembly, aiming for 30 percent of all EVs to be locally produced by 2033. The plan also outlines the country’s asset financing scheme to provide capital funding for Nigerian automotive and auto-component manufacturers.

Local and foreign entities are working together to invest in expanding Nigeria’s EV ecosystem. Nigerian Oando Clean Energy Limited, for example, is collaborating with the Chinese bus builder Yutong to deploy 12,000 electric buses by 2030, along with the associated charging infrastructure.

Climate goals and EVs: Nigeria’s long-term strategy is prioritizing clean transportation, and it has woven EV adoption into its climate commitments. Nigeria aims for 100 percent EV penetration by 2060. Critical to Nigeria’s climate strategy is transitioning to clean fuels and weaning off oil. Nigeria’s NDC targets aim for EVs to account for 60 percent of the total vehicle stock by 2050, and 100 percent by 2060.

Key stakeholders: At the national level, the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC), under Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment (FMITI), is the nodal agency for EVs. While the NADDC developed Nigeria’s automotive development plan, FMITI deploys incentives and subsidies for local EV manufacturing and adoption. At the subnational level, the Lagosian government is leading the charge for municipal electric transit, positioning itself as the testbed for EV projects in Nigeria.

Domestic auto manufacturers also play a critical role. Companies like IVM and Jet Motor Company are among the largest indigenous African EV companies. Historically, these companies have also played an important role in the EV sector. For instance, in 2020, Jet Motor Company set out to become the country’s first domestic auto manufacturer to produce a 100 percent indigenous EV, raising $9 million in research capital from a number of international investors (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Kenya

Kenya leads renewable energy generation in Africa, with over 90 percent coming from geothermal, hydropower, wind, and solar power. Kenya’s transportation sector is shifting quickly from ICE vehicles to EVs. While the EV market is new, it is rising, with over 4,193 EV units registered as of December 2024, a five-fold growth in EV registrations since 2022. While this is a small percentage of Kenya’s fleet of 2 million vehicles, it represents significant growth in EV uptake.

E-mobility landscape: There is national buy-in to support the EV transition through Kenya’s Draft National Green Fiscal Incentives Policy Framework and Draft National Electric Mobility Plan, announced in 2022 and 2024, respectively. The government has also implemented several policies and subsidies to accelerate EV adoption, including zero VAT ratings for electric bicycles, motorcycles, buses, and lithium-ion batteries, as well as import duty exemptions for some electric motorcycles.

Through specific electricity tariffs and subsidies, the estimated operating cost for operating EVs is up to eight times lower than that of ICE passenger vehicles, as well as for commercial and fleet ICE vehicles. The Kenyan government and startups are actively investing in charging infrastructure, with the government planning to install 1,000 EV charging stations by 2027. However, investments in the sector still lag. In addition to public sector and development financing, the sector needs active private sector investments to support innovation and manufacturing. Without these investments, emissions are expected to be between 4 and 31 times larger by 2050, compared to the 2010 baseline.

Climate goals and EVs: Kenya’s EV transition is part of its NDC to reduce carbon emissions by one-third by 2030. While energy demand in the country is growing, carbon-based energy sources have been diminishing, with 90 percent of all energy being sourced from renewable energy as of 2022. During COP26, Kenya signed the zero-emission vehicle declaration and joined the Accelerating to Zero Coalition, supporting the group’s multinational goal of ensuring all new cars are zero emission in leading markets by 2035, and globally by 2040.

Key stakeholders: The Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Energy jointly spearhead the Draft National Electric Mobility Plan, and the Ministry of Finance looks after deploying incentives and tax benefits for EV adoption. State utilities, namely Kenya Power, KenGen, and the Kenyan Power & Lighting Company, are prioritizing EVs in their investments to build EV charging stations and introduce new business models to increase EV adoption.

The United Nations Environment Programme, headquartered in Nairobi, is also a key player, supporting E2W/E3W pilots and rollout plans (see Table 7 in the appendix for a detailed stakeholder map).

Collaboration Potential Between India and Africa

While South Africa and India already have robust, well-connected auto manufacturing sectors, both countries can deepen their EV transition and manufacturing goals through decisive government support, knowledge sharing, and private sector collaboration. Partnership between Egypt and India can be strengthened through bilateral and multilateral platforms focused on EV manufacturing. Similarly, India-Nigeria relations, particularly on EVs, show significant potential for cooperation on targeted policy and manufacturing interventions. Kenya and India also have immense potential to accelerate EV manufacturing and the e-mobility transition, leveraging their respective renewable energy capacities.

The EMBRACE Platform: Electric Mobility Bridge for Regional Africa-India Cooperation and Exchange

India’s engagement with Africa on e-mobility presents a strategic opportunity to advance shared economic and sustainability goals. As countries transition to e-mobility, there is a clear need to create dedicated platforms that facilitate knowledge sharing, policy alignment, and coordinated action across borders. Such mechanisms foster trust, translate dialogue into actionable strategies, and strengthen collaboration across the Global South.

Envisioned as the Electric Mobility Bridge for Regional Africa-India Cooperation and Exchange (EMBRACE) Platform, this strategy brings together policymakers, industry leaders, financiers, and technical experts to accelerate the e-mobility transition. By enabling structured discussions on infrastructure, policy, and trade, the EMBRACE Platform supports informed policymaking, develops resilient and inclusive supply chains, and ensures partner countries benefit from both climate and development gains.

Architecture and Areas of Collaboration

At its core, EMBRACE aims to facilitate dialogue between policymakers and stakeholders, focusing particularly on supply chain resilience, innovation, and investment in EVs, batteries, and critical minerals. The initiative also emphasizes sustainable economic growth while promoting circular, low-emission transportation solutions aligned with long-term climate goals.",https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-09/GettyImages-145214856_cropped.jpg?VersionId=v.K8VPibM9ni_cPpX9x5sjbs5hRkGnCu,N,,2025-09-20 07:59:02.415062

The Government of Canada is working closely with the province of Nova Scotia, Indigenous communities, academia and industry to support the development of clean technology and energy projects, including tidal projects in the Bay of Fundy.

Today, the Honourable Kody Blois, on behalf of the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, and the Honourable Joanne Thompson, Minister of Fisheries, announced over $10 million in federal funding for two projects through the Energy Innovation Program:

The Ocean Sensors Innovation Platform (OSIP) led by the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy Ltd. (FORCE)

The “Reducing Fish-Turbine Collision Risk Uncertainty in the Minas Passage, Bay of Fundy” project led by Acadia University

With the world’s most powerful tides, the Bay of Fundy holds immense potential as a source of clean, renewable tidal energy. It is also a vital marine ecosystem that must be protected. Through OSIP, FORCE will develop state-of-the-art environmental monitoring platforms that collect fish and ecosystem data. Data collected will inform regulators, investors and the public to advance tidal energy so that it can be used to power Canadian homes and businesses.

Acadia University’s project will conduct fish detection studies and develop fish movement models and monitoring approaches to inform assessments of interactions between fish and tidal energy devices. Additionally, it will help to strengthen Canada’s workforce by providing opportunities for scientists and trainees to develop new technical skills to meet the needs of the growing offshore renewable energy sector.

With these projects, we are building the certainty investors need, supporting good jobs for Canadians and unlocking the Bay of Fundy’s tidal potential as part of a stronger, cleaner and more secure economy for generations to come.",https://www.canada.ca/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-19 17:01:17.509480

That means that much of the $4 billion Microsoft will spend on the facility will go untaxed along with the major costs of operating the data center once it is fully operational.
Minnesota, for instance, reinstated its sales tax on electricity at data centers in June while sales tax on equipment at the data centers was extended for up to 35 years.
The two Wisconsin data centers that have disclosed their electrical needs, Microsoft’s first data center in Mount Pleasant and the Vantage data center in Port Washington, will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power, enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, according to data from Clean Wisconsin.
Having a data center in a TID means that the company isn’t paying new property tax into the local community to fund things like roads, police, fire and schools.","(The Center Square) – When Microsoft announced plans for an additional $4 billion data center in Kenosha County on Thursday morning, it came with comments from Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Milwaukee County Executive and governor candidate David Crowley about the benefits.

But many of the usually benefits of a business entering the state – property taxes, sales tax and employment – have already been conceded by the state while questions remain about the impact of energy and water use at the facilities.

It’s why groups like Good Jobs First examine the deals surrounding data centers and provide the public with information about the deals and tax breaks, showing how these deals differ from what other businesses in Wisconsin receive.

“There are probably not a lot of benefits,” Good Jobs First Senior Research Analyst Kasia Tarczynska said. “On the tax side, if there’s any benefit it’s really difficult to know because there is so little transparency on the subsidies for these projects.”

There are six large-scale data center projects in progress in the state after Microsoft’s announcement and the state began the tax incentives for the projects in its last budget, exempting any sales tax on electricity or construction materials at any qualified data center including the water cooling systems and computing equipment. That means that much of the $4 billion Microsoft will spend on the facility will go untaxed along with the major costs of operating the data center once it is fully operational.

Tarczynska points to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. website, where there isn’t information on the value of those tax incentives available. Many states estimated up front the value of waving taxes on electricity but have found that the actual amount of electricity used has far surpassed any expectations as more projects have appeared and the energy required by the data centers has multiplied.

Minnesota, for instance, reinstated its sales tax on electricity at data centers in June while sales tax on equipment at the data centers was extended for up to 35 years.

“A lot of tax revenue is not materializing because things are thrown back to the company,” Tarczynska said. “And, on top of that, the problem is that data centers don’t create a lot of jobs. They create very few jobs and a lot of those jobs go to residents who live outside of a community.”

Construction jobs are needed when the facility is being built but, afterward, there are a few high-level analyst and electrician jobs but also lower pay security, maintenance and technician jobs.

The two Wisconsin data centers that have disclosed their electrical needs, Microsoft’s first data center in Mount Pleasant and the Vantage data center in Port Washington, will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power, enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, according to data from Clean Wisconsin. Wisconsin has only 2.8 million housing units.

“Because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built,” Clean Wisconsin Science Program Director Paul Mathewson wrote in the analysis.

That untaxed electricity usage is a concern with energy availability and consumer electricity prices an increased concern in coming years.

Data centers are expected to lead to the average American’s energy bill increasing from 25% to 70% in the next 10 years without intervention from policymakers, according to Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Jack Kemp Foundation.

https://www.thecentersquare.com/virginia/article_368b645e-a86e-11ef-8825-772ecfdea4b2.html

The first Microsoft data center on the former Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant is in a tax increment district, meaning the additional property taxes that would have been collected by local government from the project will instead be kept in the district for Microsoft’s use.

Wisconsin state lawmakers have approved exceptions for two large data centers in Port Washington and Beaver Dam to the state’s 12% rule related to tax increment financing districts capping the amount of property in a municipality that can be in a tax increment district.

Having a data center in a TID means that the company isn’t paying new property tax into the local community to fund things like roads, police, fire and schools.

Over the past decade, the Golden State’s Cap and Invest program has helped spur innovation – creating more than 30,000 jobs, building 20,000 housing units and the programs has reduced emissions by 20 percent. Team work makes the dream work.“

“These are the strongest energy affordability solutions Californians have seen in years,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas. “Bigger refunds on electricity bills, more reliable gas supplies, improved wildfire protections for homeowners, and a smarter power grid that will save families billions. We’re keeping health and environmental protections in place while building a cleaner, more resilient energy future.”

“No matter how much Trump lies, he can’t escape the truth: Earth’s atmosphere, upon which all living creatures depend, is heating up — and dangerously,” said former California Governor Jerry Brown. “Today, California boldly confronts this reality and extends our world-leading cap-and-invest program. Science over crass nonsense.”

Historic reforms will save Californians billions and cut dangerous pollution

Here’s how the package will impact Californians:

💵 Saving Californians billions of dollars and making energy more affordable.

Together, these policies will save Californians billions of dollars on energy costs and bring down customer electric bills.

The legislation provides the biggest boost to the California Climate Credit ever – which already saves millions of California families more than $100 every year on their utility bills.

Accelerates critical clean energy projects by making them easier and cheaper to build while also further integrating the use of clean energy throughout the broader West – creating more energy supply, improving grid reliability and driving down costs.

By stabilizing the state’s gasoline market, Californians will continue avoiding billions of dollars in price spikes at the pump.

⛽️ Stabilizing California’s gasoline supply to prevent price spikes.

Provides a path for a targeted, locally-led, environmentally responsible and safe increase in oil production in Kern County to boost overall fuel supplies in the state.

Protects the state’s ongoing transition away from fossil fuels by maintaining a more affordable, reliable and safe supply of fuels that is often subject to increasing volatility.

Continues the state’s commitment of ensuring the safety of existing oil pipelines and related facilities both onshore and offshore.

Encourages the state’s oil refiners to continue safe operations and further stabilize the market.

🌎 Cutting pollution and creating jobs.

Extending Cap-and-Invest, formerly known as Cap-and-Trade, to 2045 continues California’s world-leading efforts to cut climate pollution and transition to the clean economy of the future.

Doubles down on investing billions of dollars in projects that are cleaning the air in communities most impacted by toxic pollution, delivering clean water and investing in clean transportation options for Californians.

Holds private electric utilities accountable by requiring billions in investments to modernize and harden the grid at the expense of shareholders, only.

Earlier this week, the Governor approved the first allocation of $3.3 billion from Proposition 4, which was overwhelmingly passed by voters last year. The funding is going to firefighting and wildfire prevention, clean water and agriculture projects.

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Since the beginning of the Newsom Administration, battery storage is up to over 15,000 megawatts – a 1,900%+ increase, and over 25,000 megawatts of new resources have been added to the electric grid.

Recently, it also proposed to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health.
This would make it harder for citizens to keep track of how much local refineries are releasing greenhouse gases, which are the biggest drivers of climate change.
That’s absolutely critical when it comes to health,” said Lorene Allio, a member of the environmental justice group Fresh Air Vallejo.
The California Air Resources Board has a pollution mapping tool that residents can use to continue to track pollution.","VALLEJO – Last Friday, the Trump Administration announced that the Environmental Protection Agency was looking to permanently end a nationwide program that required refineries to report greenhouse gases emissions.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the program as harmful and expensive, and claimed that cutting it would save businesses billions in regulatory compliance. This is the latest in a series of environmental rollbacks from the administration. Recently, it also proposed to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health.

“It's a big step backward,” said Bill Magavern, the policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air, a nonprofit focused on air quality and climate change in California. “Reporting should be the bare minimum of what we're doing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that was agreed on a generation ago.”

The program was first established in 2009 and has long had bipartisan support. If the plan is finalized, more than 8,000 facilities across the country will no longer have any federal requirements to report how much they’re polluting. This would make it harder for citizens to keep track of how much local refineries are releasing greenhouse gases, which are the biggest drivers of climate change.

“If you don't have the data to say it's happening, how are you going to prove that it's happening? That’s absolutely critical when it comes to health,” said Lorene Allio, a member of the environmental justice group Fresh Air Vallejo. “Communities around the country won't necessarily be able to show how they're harmed, even if they are showing up at the hospital.”

Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to higher rates of asthma. Solano County has the highest rate of asthma emergency room visits in the Bay Area and the third highest in the state, according to the California Department of Public Health.

Currently, the EPA’s emission data is still on its website. The data shows that in 2023 in California, the Los Angeles Refinery was the biggest polluter in the state, emitting over 6 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. But in second place was the Chevron refinery in Richmond, emitting 4.3 million metric tons. In fourth and fifth places were Benicia’s Valero refinery and the Martinez refinery, emitting 2.9 and 2.3 metric tons, respectively.

There are a total of 21 sites — including refineries, power plants, and landfills — in Solano County and Contra Costa that reported their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA in 2023.

A 2023 study found that having a reporting program in place prompted facilities across the country to reduce their emissions by over 7%.

But even though this program may be ending at the federal level, Magavern said that California is better positioned to weather this change compared to other states. The California Air Resources Board has a pollution mapping tool that residents can use to continue to track pollution. And it has “a full fledged climate program,” said Magavern. “It does require the large emitters of greenhouse gases to report, and more importantly, to reduce their emissions.”

This program is called cap-and-invest (formerly known as cap-and-trade) and Gov. Gavin Newsom extended it until 2045 on Friday.

In the Vallejo area, there are also local organizations like the Benicia Air Monitoring Group, which has set up their own monitors to keep track of the emissions around the Benicia Valero refinery.

“It’s a continuous monitoring system. The monitors run 24/7, and it's on the website immediately,” said Kathy Kerridge, a board member with the Benicia Air Monitoring Group. “It's publicly available information.”

Meanwhile in Vallejo, Allio said that announcements like these have only motivated their organization to take more action and push for more environmental justice policies at a state and local level.

“Data is part of democracy,” said Allio. “When you take away people's right to have information, to talk about information, to share information, it's a big problem.”",https://www.vallejosun.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/09/Valero-benicia-refinery-stack-fire-05-05-2025.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 17:01:55.463669

Since 2001, California gas prices have increased 162%. Today, we pay about 43% more than the national average, and that figure would likely be far higher if not for record-high domestic oil production.

That tailwind unfortunately won’t last. While crude oil prices have fallen 19% since January, California costs and taxes have increased, now accounting for approximately 26% of the retail price of gasoline. And with the highest state excise tax per gallon in the nation, California makes several times more than a typical retailer for the same gallon of gas sold.

Platitudes and rhetoric aside, the truth is California is staring at a near-term gasoline shortfall, driven largely by the pending closure of two refineries, the highest operating costs in the nation and decades of falling in-state production. What these fuel supply challenges have not resulted in is a gigantic drop in demand. This has and will continue to lead to a greater dependence on foreign fuel, greater emissions, increased exposure to global volatility, and ultimately an increase in the price Californians pay for the fuel that powers the world’s fourth-largest economy.

We face a choice: On one side, the status quo assumes California’s economy can run without petroleum any time soon. On the other is a growing recognition that affordable energy is essential to economic stability and national security.

After spending years demonizing the oil and gas industry and accusing California’s refiners of ripping off consumers, Gov. Gavin Newsom now admits that “We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas,” under severe pressure to avert a full-blown energy crisis. At the tail end of the legislative session on Sept. 10, legislators and the governor reached an agreement to increase in-state crude oil production.

If we care about our climate goals, we must also care about where our gasoline comes from. In 1982, California imported around 6% of its oil needs from foreign sources; today, the Golden State imports around 64% from various petrostates. Shipping finished fuel thousands of miles can mean crude sourced from regimes with higher emissions and weaker oversight than California.

That’s more pollution, less transparency, less leverage for the U.S. — and yes, higher prices at the pump.

None of this is necessary, and most of this is self-created. California has one of the most underused oil reserves in the nation and some of the most advanced technologies, best-trained workforces and safest producers in the world. The Newsom administration’s recent moves to ease the bureaucratic red tape and permitting challenges that have forced us to import two-thirds of all our crude quietly admits as much.

We should use the resources we have today while we continue to build the clean energy system of tomorrow.

We also need to dial back the regulatory cost stack. On July 1, the state raised the gas excise tax and updated the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the state’s greenhouse gas reduction program. Layer on infrastructure costs, amortization, new storage mandates, refinery retrofits for changing crude blends and the lagging effects of the LCFS credit. If we care about affordability, let’s price it honestly and show the math.

Finally, equity must be both fiscally and morally sound. California’s gas tax — roughly 61 cents per gallon — pays for the roads we all use. Meanwhile, electric vehicle drivers don’t pay the tax but still use the same infrastructure. As EV adoption grows, the revenue gap widens. In a state that prides itself on equity, a fair solution is to stop subsidizing EV owners on the shoulders of other drivers and adopt a more equitable mileage-based road fee for EVs that accounts for miles driven and vehicle weight, which better reflects road wear.

Newsom’s long-overdue acknowledgement of a pending gasoline and price crisis — together with the Legislature’s last-minute actions — are a start but also a piecemeal approach to addressing a critical problem.

As a next step, the Legislature should consider the repeal of regulations limiting production and pipeline use in more counties, assess the powers of agency bureaucrats who force higher prices on the backs of Californians, and a new regulatory strategy that will provide a more hospitable business environment for refiners and producers.

That ultimately means greater fuel and price security for California consumers.

Wait times for power projects on the interconnection queue have increased to as long as five years, according to Rep.
He blamed projects supported by green energy tax credits for the longer wait times and highlighted the growing demand for facilities to power AI data centers.
The bills collectively “double down on the Trump administration's commitment to raising American electricity prices by discriminating against clean, cheap energy,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member on the House energy and commerce committee.","Through mostly partisan votes, lawmakers in the House of Representatives advanced legislation Sept. 18 that proponents say will accelerate some energy-related projects, but some Democrats warn will raise energy prices.

The Promoting Cross-border Energy Infrastructure Act has a goal to make the process to authorize construction of international border-crossing facilities for import and export of oil and natural gas, and the transmission of electricity, “more uniform, transparent and modern.”

It would require anyone planning to build such a facility to obtain a certificate of crossing from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the U.S. Dept. of Energy for electric transmission facilities. The agencies would have 120 days to issue a certificate or deny an application if not in the public interest, or just 30 days for natural gas facilities on the Mexican or Canadian borders.

The bill includes an exemption for any projects with a presidential permit.

Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.), who sponsored the bill, said in a statement that it would address regulatory uncertainty that has grown under the current process, which involves a mix of permits, different agencies’ procedures and executive discretion. She pointed to then-President Joe Biden’s decision to revoke the Keystone XL pipeline permit on the first day of his term in 2021.

“By passing my legislation, the House has taken a critical step to end years of regulatory uncertainty and partisan games that have delayed energy infrastructure projects, crushed good-paying jobs and undermined America’s energy security,” Fedorchak said.

Power sector groups have supported the legislation. Marco Giamberardino, senior vice president of public and government affairs at the National Electrical Contractors Association, said in a statement that the bill “enables more timely project delivery and ensures stable workloads for NECA contractors nationwide.”

Another bill, the Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act, or GRID Power Act, would assist power plant developers to fast-track project reviews. It directs the commission to initiate rulemaking “to address inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of existing procedures” in processing interconnection requests. Transmission providers could submit proposals for the commission to adjust its interconnection queue to prioritize dispatchable power plants.

Providers would need to demonstrate the need for a given project’s prioritization and describe how it would improve grid reliability and resilience. FERC would have 60 days to review and approve or deny a proposal.

Wait times for power projects on the interconnection queue have increased to as long as five years, according to Rep. Troy Balderson (R-Ohio), who sponsored the bill. He blamed projects supported by green energy tax credits for the longer wait times and highlighted the growing demand for facilities to power AI data centers.

“With American power demand far outpacing our ability to generate more electricity, our grid is heading toward a reliability crisis,” Balderson said in a statement. “The interconnection queue is overwhelmed and bogged down, leaving shovel-ready power projects waiting for years while demand continues to climb.”

A third bill advanced Sept. 18 reestablishes the National Coal Council, which shut down in the Energy Dept. when its charter expired in 2021. Per the charter, the council’s 120-150 members meet twice a year to advise the Energy secretary on coal policy matters, and are appointed by the secretary for terms of up to two years.

The bills collectively “double down on the Trump administration's commitment to raising American electricity prices by discriminating against clean, cheap energy,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member on the House energy and commerce committee. “They prove that Republicans have never been for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and they don’t care about fixing the insanely high cost of living that is crushing families across this country right now.”

The state has only to reach its remaining 20,480 eligible homes and businesses, the state said, because of successful investments under American Rescue Plan Act money contributing to a relatively rapid reduction in unserved and underserved locations.

Of the $551 million originally available under BEAD grants, South Carolina is aiming to spend just $41.3 million, or 7.49 percent.

New York also released its tentative grant winners under the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program this week, bringing the total to 43 states.

Meanwhile, a non-profit group called the Community Broadband Action Network confirmed the Commerce Department was moving ahead with plans to further drive down state spending before approving those draft proposals and allowing funds out the door.

South Carolina locations split between fiber and satellite

South Carolina locations would be roughly split between satellite and fiber, with 48.7 percent to be served by low-earth orbit satellite and 47.85 percent slated for fiber. The small number of remaining homes and businesses would get cable.

Amazon’s nascent Kuiper Systems would cover most of the satellite locations, about 8,900 to SpaceX’s 1,000. ZiTEL and TruVista would take the majority of the wireline locations, with AT&T, Charter, and Comcast serving several hundred each in addition to small projects from other local companies.

“Today’s release of the SC BEAD Final Proposal provides our plan for the anchor leg of the broadband investment relay race here in South Carolina,” Jim Stritzinger, director of the South Carolina Broadband Office, said in a statement.

“With an extraordinary team, in just over three years, we completed four ARPA investment rounds representing $400 million, and $41.3 million in BEAD, to 22 ISPs. From SCBBO inception (July 2021), combined federal, state, and private investments resulted in service to over 200,000 locations. Additionally, nearly 99 percent of these recently constructed locations now have access to fiber – or will soon!”

New York big on terrestrial fixed wireless

In New York, terrestrial fixed wireless would serve the largest portion of the state’s 53,918 BEAD locations, something not seen in any other state to have reported results so far, at about 44 percent. Fiber would take 30.72 percent and satellite, provided by SpaceX, would take 25.25 percent.

“Every community in New York State deserves to have access to the internet and it is time we uplift our underserved communities, providing them with more opportunities and resources,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said in a statement.

The states will take public comments on their plans for one week before submitting them to Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration for approval.

A hidden NTIA cap on BEAD?

The awards are tentative and might be altered by NTIA before being finally approved. Last week, after apparent NTIA cost thresholds and an apparent internal memo leaked to broadband marketing executive Doug Adams, people involved in the process told Broadband Breakfast NTIA was seeking to have states negotiate down or potentially award to another provider grant awards that came above those cost caps.

CBAN’s executive director Curtis Dean said that a member company in Iowa had received notice from the broadband office there that some of its project costs had been deemed excessive and would have to be corrected within 72 hours, or within 3 days.

“Applicants can reduce costs by cutting expenses or increasing matching funds” or “provide extraordinary circumstances justifications,” Dean said. “The email explains that failure to respond by the deadline will result in locations being awarded to other applicants.”

Two people familiar with the matter said a similar process was underway in multiple other states. One said NTIA was also looking for states to further trim their lists of community anchor institutions, which are in line for fiber once a state’s eligible homes and businesses are taken care of.

ISPs bid on geographic units called project areas, the structure of which differ in each state, and many tentative BEAD projects encompassing several project areas.

The cost thresholds Dean outlined line up with the spreadsheet posted by Adams.

Question about non-deployment funds

It’s not clear what will happen to states’ BEAD money that isn’t used on broadband deployment projects. The 43 states to have reported results would have more than $16 billion in such “non-deployment” funding.

States were planning to use that left over money on things like broadband adoption and workforce development efforts, but the Trump administration isn’t eager to see much non-deployment spending. The NTIA rescinded approval for those activities in June and said more guidance was forthcoming.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/09/AP25077653033685-mcmaster.jpeg,N,,2025-09-19 16:01:46.102488

Long Live All-of-the-Above Energy… - The Breakthrough Institute,"Ted Nordhaus, Alex Trembath",,,,,https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/quiet-climate-policy-is-dead-long-live-all-of-the-above-energy-policy,"Even as pitched partisan battles over climate science, carbon regulation, and the Paris Agreement intensified, quiet climate policy largely prevailed when it came to energy innovation and investment.
The decade-long effort to center climate in US energy policy is over.
Pitched political battles over electricity generation, moreover, don’t address the source of much of the increase in retail electricity prices.
For Democrats, environmentalists, and clean energy advocates, this represents a “who moved my cheese” moment, where not just talking points and arguments will need to change but the entire basis of clean energy advocacy.
Quiet climate policy is dead.","Last January, in the Wall Street Journal, we argued that efforts to preserve the whole of the Inflation Reduction Act were both bad policy and politically doomed. Republicans had run against the IRA and needed to cut trillions of dollars to finance the extension of tax cuts established during the first Trump administration. One way or another, they were going to take a pound of flesh and it behooved climate and clean energy advocates to get clear about what in the IRA was worth saving.

We also argued that there was plenty of fat to cut. The vast majority of IRA spending was flowing towards mature technologies—wind, solar, and electric vehicles—that were well established in electricity and automotive markets. Preserving IRA money for these technologies wouldn’t appreciably change their trajectory, or the trajectory of US carbon emissions, which have been falling at a consistent rate for decades.

Rather, the main obstacles to continuing growth of those technologies are not primarily their direct costs, which continue to fall, but a range of well understood challenges associated with integrating these very different technologies into the legacy electricity and transportation sectors—permitting, transmission, and intermittency in the former case, range and charging infrastructure in the latter.

This message was not well received by many climate and clean energy advocates. They believed that the Biden administration’s clever Green Vortex strategy, which overwhelmingly directed clean tech spending toward Republican districts, might insulate wind, solar, and EV tax credits politically and accused us of “negotiating with ourselves.” Forever subsidies for wind, solar, and electric vehicles, moreover, were necessary because the future of the climate hung in the balance.

In reality, we weren’t negotiating with ourselves. We’ve long argued that public subsidies should support early stage commercialization of clean energy technologies and should phase out as those technologies achieve traction in energy and transportation markets. The point of clean tech industrial policy should be to make clean energy cheap in real, unsubsidized terms, not to prop up uncompetitive technologies in perpetuity.

Nor did the fate of the climate, or even US emissions, hang in the balance. Groups like Energy Innovation and Princeton’s Net Zero America that had promoted the legislation produced modeling purporting to show dire consequences if Trump were elected and repealed the IRA. But well before Trump and Republican majorities gutted it, the IRA was underperforming its promised emissions benefits while costing far more than initially estimated. In reality, emissions over the short and medium term were always likely to converge toward the long-term historic US decarbonization rate with or without the IRA. What will matter over the longer term are nascent technologies necessary for further progress: long duration energy storage, advanced nuclear energy, geothermal, and industrial decarbonization.

As it happened, the final package broadly comported with our political analysis. A handful of EV, battery, and solar assembly factories in Republican districts were not going to sidetrack tax, fiscal, and energy policy priorities that were far more important to the Republican coalition. The key fights that were there to be won were to preserve policy support for nuclear, carbon capture, geothermal and other nascent technologies in the face of the opposition from the Freedom Caucus’ fiscal hawks, along with beating back a last minute effort to tax wind and solar energy production.

If it had stopped there, we’d be taking a victory lap today. High-priority programs to promote nuclear, geothermal, energy storage and similar were not only preserved but extended through 2035. The sunsetting of wind and solar subsidies gave Democrats strong incentives to work with Republicans on permitting reform. And there was substantial demand in Congress to develop domestic critical mineral supply chains, and provide sufficient support for the commercialization of next generation nuclear energy technologies.

In place of the Biden administration’s whole of government climate obsession, you could almost convince yourself that federal energy policy was swinging back toward the successful all of the above energy policies that held sway across both the Obama administration and the first Trump administration—to the benefit of both America’s economic performance and its impressive decarbonization over the last two decades.

But, of course, it hasn’t ended there. The Trump administration has now borrowed a page from the Biden playbook, answering Democrats’ punitive approach towards fossil fuel and mining projects by turning the formidable administrative powers of the executive branch against wind and solar energy development. That effort has not only endangered clean energy production that America needs to meet rising demand in the short term, but has also substantially reduced the likelihood that Congress will get very far in efforts to reform permitting and other outdated environmental laws that now stand in the way of energy development of all kinds.

Polarization Trumps Green Pork

The green vortex strategy was, in one sense, an effort to build a durable bipartisan political base for the clean energy economy. By directing enormous public funding for clean energy manufacturing and production toward Republican and right-leaning congressional districts, the idea was that the representatives of these districts would have strong political incentives to support clean energy policies and subsidies whether they were Democrats or Republicans and whichever party controlled Congress and the executive branch. And perhaps, had Kamala Harris squeaked out a victory last November, four more years of public investment in these programs would have proven that strategy out.

But it is also the case that most of these policies already had bipartisan support. A broad swath of Republican politicians had supported tax credits, loan guarantees, ARPA-E, and other policies to support clean energy, electric vehicles, and other clean tech going back to the last years of the George W. Bush administration, including through the first Trump administration. Even as pitched partisan battles over climate science, carbon regulation, and the Paris Agreement intensified, quiet climate policy largely prevailed when it came to energy innovation and investment. But the era of quiet climate policy, it seems, ended with the passage of the IRA, or more precisely, with the fateful determination to enact those policies through a maximalist and entirely partisan budget reconciliation process in the name of historic climate action.

The bet by the Biden administration was that it could use budget reconciliation in the same way that the Obama administration had used the parliamentary procedure to pass the Affordable Care Act. Give the public a valuable benefit and policy-makers would be loath to take it away. Meanwhile, through its implementation, the Administration would use the IRA to make sure that Republican congressional districts benefited from the spending in much the same way that the Pentagon distributed defense production (or pork) widely around the country to assure bipartisan support for defense spending.

But in contrast to the ACA, most households saw little benefit from the IRA. Electricity prices in most places continued to rise and most people remained unconvinced that electric vehicles were a viable option despite the generous subsidies. And while defense spending was broadly supported by both parties in the Cold War era, when the Pentagon built a durable political economy around the military industrial complex, passage of a massive spending package for clean energy on a straight party-line vote in the name of averting a climate apocalypse put a huge partisan target on the IRA and the clean tech economy.

In the age of Donald Trump and an era defined by negative polarization, the results were predictable. Climate polarization swallowed the formerly bipartisan commitments to energy innovation whole, ushering in the fate that we have long warned of: that catastrophism and polarization were a positive feedback loop, imperiling not just conventionally toxic climate policies like carbon taxes and regulations but pragmatic quiet climate policies as well, such as transmission investment, conventional pollution regulations, and energy innovation.

Live By the Electricity Price Sword, Die By the Electricity Price Sword?

In the face of the Trump administration’s full frontal assault on wind and solar, much of the clean energy and climate advocacy community has pivoted, warning today not of looming climate catastrophe but an electricity price apocalypse. For the first time in decades, electricity demand is growing rapidly. Electricity rates are rising around the country. Natural gas production has flatlined. And now, alongside the phase out of subsidies, the Trump administration aims to block the siting of wind and solar projects on public lands and federal waters.

There is a belief among many advocates that Trump and the Republican Party will die by the same electricity price sword that they used so effectively against Biden and the Democratic Party in the last election. The public will blame Trump’s vendetta against wind and solar for the price hike, swinging the mid-term elections to Democrats or, at least, forcing Trump to backtrack in the same way that Biden was forced to reverse course on his administration’s moratorium on oil and gas development on public lands.

This may come to pass. But there are also reasons for skepticism. First, Trump, to a much greater degree than Biden, inherited rising electricity prices. As with the broader issue of inflation, Biden had the bad fortune of taking office just as energy prices were rebounding after the Covid pandemic, a problem that was then made worse by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Biden’s various energy policies were not the main event in the run up of energy prices. But in the context of a lot of other things that were out of his control, policies that seemingly contributed to the problem were bound to get an outsized share of the blame.

Second, it is not yet clear that Trump’s moves against renewable energy will be as politically salient as Biden’s moves against oil and gas. Gasoline prices typically set the template for public perception of energy prices more broadly and Trump has been extremely proactive about encouraging Saudi Arabia and other global producers to increase production, even though this has disadvantaged US oil and gas production.

As a result, while electricity prices are rising, gasoline prices are not. So it is not at all clear either that higher electricity prices will stoke public concern about Trump’s energy policies absent an increase in gasoline prices or that the voters or the public will so easily be convinced to accept a connection between Trump' s assault on wind and solar and electricity prices as they were to accept that Biden’s early moves against fossil fuels were responsible for high gas prices specifically and rising energy prices more generally. Indeed, recent polling suggests that voters are more likely to blame corporations and state governments than the Trump Administration for rising electricity prices.

Finally, the narrative that Democrats and clean energy advocates have begun to tell, about the cancellation of wind and solar projects causing rising electricity prices, is complicated by the widespread perception that wind and solar are responsible for high electricity prices in California and other blue states. This claim is highly contested. Clean energy advocates point to trends in wholesale electricity prices, for instance, which don’t show a strong correlation with renewable energy penetration.

But whether high retail electricity prices are the result of the costs of transmission, distribution, and other measures necessary to integrate variable renewable generation into electrical grids, wildfires, or just the “blue state model” more broadly, the fact remains that many of the highest profile Democrat-run states, including New York, California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Massachusetts feature very high electricity prices. This problem is further exacerbated by what has, to date, been Exhibit A in the effort to blame Trump for high electricity prices, which is the repeal of IRA subsidies for wind and solar, which undermines the claim that these electricity sources are cheap, not expensive.

In short, while the Trump administration’s energy agenda may not prove a recipe for either energy abundance or energy dominance, it is not clear that Trump or Republicans will pay a particularly high political price for it, particularly given how polarized the politics of energy, not just climate, has become.

Electricity Prices Are Too Damn High

Beyond the dueling claims about who is responsible for high electricity prices, what is clear is that energy price, reliability, and security are now the coin of the realm. The decade-long effort to center climate in US energy policy is over.

Yet neither fossil energy-focused Republicans nor renewable energy-focused Democrats are likely to make much headway on electricity prices in the short term. US natural gas production was already at record levels in the last years of the Biden administration. Gas production is expected to tick up a bit more this year but won’t grow remotely fast enough to keep up with demand growth.

Wind and solar, meanwhile, were not coming to the rescue of electricity ratepayers even if Kamala Harris were president and the IRA had not been repealed. Solar generation was growing rapidly even before the passage of the IRA and most current projections foresee strong continuing growth despite the phaseout of subsidies. Wind energy deployment, by contrast, was already flagging, due to rising commodity prices and exorbitant costs for off-shore projects even before the Trump administration’s recent moves against off-shore wind and the repeal of the IRA’s subsidies. Had Harris won the 2024 election instead of Trump, electricity prices would be rising just as rapidly and Republicans would be blaming the IRA for today’s electricity prices, just as they were before the election.

Pitched political battles over electricity generation, moreover, don’t address the source of much of the increase in retail electricity prices. Rather, a substantial portion is associated with the cost of transmission and distribution, which in many places has been rising faster than the cost of wholesale electricity generation.

The costs of maintaining and expanding transmission and distribution owes to many factors, including grid hardening in the face of extreme weather and rising commodity prices, as well as the costs of integrating geographically diffuse intermittent electricity generators like wind and solar. But it is also in significant part an unintended consequence of the effort to restructure and liberalize electricity markets.

Electricity market liberalization has allowed for competitive electricity generation markets and has been good for both the natural gas and wind and solar industries. But it also, by design, pushed utilities out of the electricity generation business. As a result, most utilities around the country now make their money through transmission and distribution, where they still maintain their regulated monopoly status and are still granted a guaranteed profit on top of the cost of building and maintaining transmission and distribution infrastructure.

Unsurprisingly, this has incentivized utilities to build and upgrade a lot more transmission and distribution infrastructure, and those are the costs that in most of the country are rising fastest. Worse, the institutional capacity to plan and coordinate investment for affordability, reliability, and decarbonization has been deeply compromised by a utility landscape that was already highly decentralized, by the many Rube Golbergesque variations of electricity market liberalization, and by the transformation of federal and state energy policy into culture war objects.

Wicked Electricity

Last spring, Alex declared the era of the climate hawk over, noting that none of the conditions that had allowed climate advocates to believe that climate change could be established as a durable priority for US policymakers over the decade or so before the COVID pandemic any longer obtained. Post-Covid budget deficits, supply chain challenges, and inflation had brought an end to the low interest rates and expansionary fiscal policy that had underwritten public clean energy investments over the previous decade. The post-COVID recovery and huge new demand from data centers reversed a generation of slow energy demand growth, putting upward pressure on electricity prices and making policy tradeoffs between energy costs and clean energy and climate objectives even more toxic politically than they already were. Perhaps most importantly, the election of Donald Trump had put to rest the notion that inexorable demographic trends would allow for sustained Democratic majorities which would prioritize climate policy at the federal level.

This shift appears unlikely to be temporary. Democrats might take back the House or even the Senate in the midterm elections and perhaps they will retake the presidency in 2028. But high interest rates and budget deficits are likely to be with us for a long time. So are high electricity prices. Despite America’s remarkable innovation capacities and energy resource endowments, we do not have the right mix of technologies nor the institutional arrangements nor the political leadership to solve the electricity problem anytime soon.

This will create possibilities for some clean energy technologies. Higher prices and supply constraints are good news for anyone who can get so-called “clean firm” generation technologies commercialized, sited, and built at a competitive price, whether that is advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, natural gas with carbon removal, or solar with long-duration battery storage. But the balkanized utility landscape, liberalized electricity markets, and diversity of rent-seeking interests competing for a share of the electricity generation and distribution pie make neither more centralized and rationalized planning of the electricity system nor truly competitive and efficient market based solutions particularly feasible.

We have long written about the wicked nature of climate change, which suffers not merely from polarization but rampant solution-based problem definition, policy-based evidence making, and arbitrary boundary setting. “The expert is also the player in a political game, seeking to promote his private vision of goodness over others,” as Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber, the UC Berkeley urban planning professors who first applied the idea of wickedness to policy debates, wrote over 50 years ago. “What comprises problem-solution for one is problem-generation for another.”

America’s electricity landscape is now wicked. The sheer number of conflicting economic and ideological interests make electricity cost and reliability a problem to be managed, not solved. Electricity costs are increasingly salient at a moment when cost of living concerns remain high and yet are not salient enough to discipline political actors and policy making in a nation in which a highly polarized public and even more polarized opinion elites are mostly rich enough to ignore cost of living concerns when they conflict with their ideological priors.

While there is no solving the problem, there are problems to solve. The electricity price crisis is the result of multiple causes, including generation and supply shortfalls; permitting, transmission and interconnection bottlenecks; wildfire mitigation, particularly in the west; and kludgy regulatory and market restructuring that simultaneously socializes the costs of goldplated infrastructure, subsidizes high-volume customers, and simulates competitive generation markets.

Solutions to these problems will look different in liberalized versus traditionally regulated utility markets. They will also look different in different parts of the country. Solutions that work in Texas, with abundant wind, solar, and natural gas resources competing in the most liberalized electricity market in the nation will not look the same as North Carolina or Florida, where vertically integrated monopoly utilities still lean heavily on nuclear and coal, or the Tennessee Valley, where TVA operates a publicly owned system powered predominantly with nuclear and natural gas.

For these reasons, as a matter of both policy and political communication, all-of-the-above energy policy remains both the most robust approach to the wicked and highly differentiated nature of America’s electricity system and, demonstrably, the best political approach. Neither Bill McKibben’s solar liberation nor Trump’s fossil-heavy energy dominance agenda are plausible alternatives.

Back to an All-of-the-Above Future

Democrats and clean energy advocates still have a lot of unlearning to do. We were both struck during our week in DC for Abundance 2025 how hard it was for even moderate, Abundance-pilled Democratic politicians, despite the determination to pivot to electricity cost, to talk about energy and electricity without talking about climate change. They would start off on their talking points, about AI and data centers, the need for more renewable energy and President Trump’s anti-abundance assault on wind and solar, and then they’d veer back to talking about climate change and decarbonization.

This was, perhaps, by design—based on the perception that they still need to signal to environmentalists that they care deeply about climate change. But if so, it is a poor design. When Democrats and clean energy advocates extoll the benefits of renewable energy to keep electricity costs under control, their supporters already know that they care about climate change. By contrast, when they muddle their energy affordability message with talk about climate change and emissions, they end up signalling to everyone else that what they really care about is climate change, not electricity costs.

Climate advocates, for their part, do their partners in the Democratic Party no favors by rebranding conventional green policies as an “energy affordability” strategy. A policy agenda that supports residential rooftop solar while opposing fossil fuel drilling and pipelines will strike voters as an agenda to keep energy prices high, because that’s what it is, notwithstanding talking points about shielding ratepayers from fuel price volatility and promises of solar energy too cheap to meter.

Trump and Republicans may face similar problems by the time the 2026 or 2028 elections come along. But removing subsidies, as they did in the Big Beautiful bill, likely won’t have the same political valence as the Biden Administration’s sweeping gestures towards fossil fuel abolition. That said, blocking wind, solar, and transmission development on public lands may undermine public support for the Trump Administration's energy dominance agenda.

Ultimately, whoever controls the affordability debate is likely to have the upper hand. For Democrats, environmentalists, and clean energy advocates, this represents a “who moved my cheese” moment, where not just talking points and arguments will need to change but the entire basis of clean energy advocacy. Policies to “keep it in the ground” are dead and aren’t coming back. The conflation of policies to make clean energy cheap with perpetual subsidies for renewable energy has polarized opinion toward what were once popular technologies and undermined claims that these technologies are cheap and hold the key to lower electricity prices. Hardest of all, clean energy advocates, not just Democrats, will need to learn to talk about the benefits that fossil fuels bring to America’s energy and electricity systems, even as they advocate for diversifying away from them.

This will seem new to many. But it is not so new for an older generation of Democrats and environmentalists. It is the language and agenda of the Clinton and Obama administrations, from before the time that the climate hawks seized control of the Democratic Party. It is still the most popular and durable approach to energy affordability and decarbonization, and holds the key to restoring credibility on the energy issue for both Democrats and clean energy advocates.

“LENOWISCO Planning District Commission believes that the Brownfields Program creates great potential for Southwest Virginia communities.

“This EPA Brownfield Assessment Coalition grant for $1.2 million helps LENOWISCO Planning District Commission continue its goals to redevelop hazardous or polluted sites in deep Southwest Virginia.”

BACKGROUND

In May, Congressman Griffith announced that LENOWISCO Planning District Commission received a different $1.2 million Brownfield Assessment grant from the EPA. That funding supported a community-wide assessment of local brownfields.

According to the EPA, Assessment Coalition grants are designed for one “lead” eligible entity to partner with two to four eligible entities that do not have the capacity to apply for and manage their own EPA cooperative agreement and otherwise would not have access to Brownfields grant resources.

Before his July appointment as Health Subcommittee Chairman, Congressman Griffith chaired the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment.

In March of 2025, Congressman Griffith chaired a hearing on the EPA’s Brownfields Program. Scott County Native and LENOWISCO Planning District Commission Executive Director Duane Miller testified to the panel and discussed the Program’s importance to Southwest Virginia communities.

LENOWISCO Planning District Commission serves the Counties of Lee, Wise and Scott and the City of Norton.

The Brownfields Program empowers states, communities and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse brownfields.

A brownfield site is real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.

Brownfield Assessment grants provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments and community outreach.

Congressman Griffith’s e-newsletter on the Program can be found here.

Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water, said that level of demand would be significant for the region.
“It’s a meaningful chunk of water that would otherwise be reserved for residential or commercial growth,” said Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water.
While the overall national water use of data centers remains small compared with agriculture or industry, Ren noted that local impacts can be far greater.
Ren said roughly half of data centers are not publicly disclosing their water use.","The rapid growth of artificial intelligence is fueling demand not just for electricity but also for water, raising new questions for communities in North Carolina.

Industry estimates show a 250-megawatt data center can use about a billion gallons of water each year, or 2.7 million gallons a day.

Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water, said that level of demand would be significant for the region.

“It’s a meaningful chunk of water that would otherwise be reserved for residential or commercial growth,” said Ed Buchan, assistant director of Raleigh Water. “That’s about what the demand is for some of our merger communities like Knightdale and Wendell.”

Buchan said that most water utilities return nearly all of what they treat back to the river basin, but cooling systems at data centers often evaporate it. “If it’s evaporated, it’s basically out of the equation,” he said. That could pose risks during drought, when downstream flow is critical.

Shaolei Ren, a University of California Riverside professor who has studied AI’s water footprint, said usage can spike during the hottest months. That means competition with residents who already need more water in summer. “Understanding the peak usage is also important in addition to the annual total,” Ren said.

While the overall national water use of data centers remains small compared with agriculture or industry, Ren noted that local impacts can be far greater. “We need to look at the specific context and understand if it is creating some pressure on the water infrastructures,” he said.

Michael Pencina, Duke University’s vice dean for data science, said sustainability must be part of AI’s future. At Duke, researchers are exploring ways to recycle the heat generated by computing power. “We’ve looked at using the heat from GPU farms to warm up water that’s used across campus,” he said. “It’s about being creative in reducing the footprint while still advancing discovery.”

AI companies have pledged to become “water positive” by 2030, yet transparency remains a challenge. Ren said roughly half of data centers are not publicly disclosing their water use. “Without knowing the numbers, how can we manage these resources responsibly,” he asked.

A Washington Post analysis found a ChatGPT text query uses only about five drops of water, but those small amounts add up when multiplied by billions of requests and the massive cooling demands of data centers.

Buchan said Raleigh has enough supply to handle one or two large facilities, but multiple sites could speed the need for new reservoirs or other costly projects. “If you had a significant number of them come into your service area, and then they were the type that evaporated a lot of water, then that might move up your need for a new water resource pretty quickly,” he said.

Communities weighing data center proposals are often drawn to their high property tax value.

“Data centers clearly have benefits,” Ren said. “On the other hand, they also use resources like power and water. The real question is whether those tradeoffs add up to a net benefit for the community.”",https://images.wral.com/ba85002e-96cb-4e4d-aab9-d9863654e3ea?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-09-19 15:02:44.634076

This week, the campaign continues with additional events and rallies in today California, Arizona and Nevada. These events will engage constituents by delivering petitions, holding more events to come in additional states across the country and holding members of Congress accountable by urging them to stop increasing costs.

These events build on the more than 115 events LCV and state partners have already hosted across the country since the Big Ugly Bill passed.

The Big Ugly Bill raises costs across the board including healthcare, groceries, and utility bills, jeopardizes clean energy jobs, and guts critical programs that protect the health and safety of people.

“Families are struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford the rising costs that Congressional Republicans are making so much worse” said LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber. “Republicans in Congress who voted for the Big Ugly Bill have broken their promise to their constituents to lower costs. They are siding with Big Polluters and other powerful billionaires and hurting working families by cutting widely supported investments and programs that mean energy, health care and grocery bills are going up. At a time of rising energy demand and extreme climate disasters, it makes no sense to block affordable clean energy solutions and roll back protections for our health and our environment. Our elected leaders should instead be investing in affordable energy solutions that work for us all and safeguard our communities, our planet, and future generations.”

“Our Latine and communities of color were already hurting before they passed this catastrophic legislation that will continue to raise our energy bills, make our air dirtier, impact our health,” said Chispa Arizona Executive Director Vianey Olivarría. “Our leaders who voted for these policies are responsible for the harm they are placing on all our families and neighborhoods.”

The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) prohibits constructing an “emission unit” without the requisite air permit. Yet many large capital projects involve both emitting and non-emitting components, and for decades, project developers have faced uncertainty about where the line is drawn. A 1986 “Reich memo” suggested that even “accommodating installations”—like foundations, pads, and roofs—might require permits. This expansive view often forced companies to delay construction of non-emitting components, even when those components were the rate-limiting step for development. The result: slower timelines and higher costs.

On September 2, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) provided long-awaited clarity. In a letter opinion, the agency confirmed that the prohibition applies only to construction “on an emissions unit” itself—not related non-emitting infrastructure. At the same time, EPA announced it would undertake a rulemaking to codify this narrower boundary, limiting future administrations’ ability to revert to the broader 1986 guidance without a full rulemaking.

EPA’s clarification may allow project developers in certain industries to get a head start on construction. But project sponsors, investors, and lenders alike should note that any construction remains at the permittee’s own risk: time and money spent before the permit is issued will not influence whether the permit is granted or the conditions it will impose.

The 2025 EPA Interpretation

In July 2025, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC Arizona Corporation (“TSMC”) sought clarification from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (“MCAQD”) on whether it could begin construction of the foundation, steel superstructure, and exterior walls of a manufacturing plant prior to MCAQD’s issuance of the plant’s air permit. MCAQD agreed that TSMC was not prohibited from constructing the “core and shell” of the plant because these structures are not a source of emissions under the CAA. Nevertheless, MCAQD sought EPA’s concurrence.

EPA’s September 2 response letter (the “TSMC Letter”) explains that permit applicants can commence permanent on-site construction activities prior to receipt of a New Source Review (“NSR”) preconstruction permit, provided that no construction is performed “on an emissions unit.” EPA agreed that, based on the facts provided, erecting TSMC’s proposed plant’s superstructure would not constitute construction “on an emissions unit” and so is not prohibited by the CAA. But EPA cautioned that any construction performed would be at TSMC’s own risk, meaning that the time and resources TSMC expended on the superstructure cannot be used to influence or justify any permitting decisions, and that TSMC would assume the risk that the permit could contain conditions requiring TSMC to modify or rebuild what was already in progress.

EPA concurrently shared its intent to finalize by the end of 2026 revisions to its regulatory definition of “begin actual construction,” to more clearly articulate the construction activities prohibited by the CAA. EPA has since updated its webpage, “Construction Activities Allowed Before Obtaining a Preconstruction Air Permit,” with this information and a reference to the TSMC Letter. In the interim, EPA will continue to provide case-by-case guidance on pre-permit construction.

The Regulatory Background

The CAA generally prohibits the construction of stationary sources of air pollutants without an NSR preconstruction permit. EPA implements the CAA’s preconstruction permitting mandate through regulations, which states must incorporate into their respective state implementation plans.

EPA’s regulations provide that major stationary sources cannot “begin actual construction” without a permit. “Begin actual construction” is defined as “in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature,” including the emission unit’s supports and foundation, underground pipework, and storage facilities.1 Emissions units are “any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the potential to emit” regulated pollutants.2

The TSMC Letter arguably preserves the status quo: based on the plain text of EPA’s regulations, project developers like TSMC have never been constrained from beginning construction on non-emitting structures. Only construction “on an emissions unit” is prohibited. More fundamentally, it is reasonable to conclude that structures with no emissions are beyond the ambit of the CAA, as MCAQD and the TSMC Letter posit.

However, earlier EPA guidance like the 1986 “Reich memo” suggested that EPA would view construction of “any accommodating installation” related to an emissions unit as prohibited by the CAA. This historically drove developers to take overly conservative approaches to pre-permit construction, to the detriment of project development timelines—a problem the TSMC Letter appears to alleviate.3

Takeaways

The impacts will vary considerably by industry and potentially also by state, given state permitting agencies are not obligated to follow EPA guidance. For manufacturing and data center development, which often have significant non-emitting infrastructure, the TSMC Letter may promote accelerated construction timelines. Indeed, EPA’s decision to revise the “begin actual construction” regulatory definition is explicitly linked to the current administration’s desire to ramp up the deployment of domestic manufacturing and data center infrastructure. However, with respect to projects where virtually all equipment has potential to emit or is a direct accessory to such emitting equipment, the potential benefits are less clear.

Bottom line: The TSMC Letter gives project developers new room to maneuver, but not without risk. Expect federal courts to weigh in—via citizen suits or rulemaking challenges—on whether the CAA bars construction of non-emitting yet essential project structures before a permit is in hand. And after Loper Bright, it is the judiciary, not EPA, that will have the last word.

What work does Type One Energy hope to do at Bull Run?

Type One is planning to build the world’s first commercial nuclear fusion plant on the former TVA site. The Knoxville-based firm aims to use a machine called a stellarator to contain superheated plasma at the pilot plant being developed with TVA.

Its design plan is a break from traditional nuclear power plants, which use fission - the process of splitting uranium isotopes apart - to create heat. Fusion reactions instead smash hydrogen isotopes together for heat.

Company scientists have built stellarators, but not under the Type One name. Once the plant is fully online - possibly in the 2030s - it could create as many as 330 jobs, according to Type One’s leaders. They previously said they hoped to start constructing Infinity One, a prototype stellarator, in 2026.

Type One Energy has had an Oak Ridge office since August 2023 and works with both TVA and Oak Ridge National Laboratory on expanding its fusion projects. It was the first company to receive a grant − $4.5 million − from Tennessee’s Nuclear Energy Fund.

Microsoft on Thursday announced it will build a $4 billion advanced artificial intelligence data center in Mount Pleasant over the next three years, which will be similar in size and scale to the initial $3.3 billion facility set to be operational in 2026. The company’s total Wisconsin investment has reached roughly $7.3 billion.

“We’re in the final phases of building Fairwater, the world’s most powerful AI data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin — part of a region forged by generations of hard work and ingenuity,” wrote Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, in an announcement.

In May 2024, Microsoft announced its first data center complex in southeastern Wisconsin, which included a visit from former President Joe Biden. The company initially planned a 1.5 million-square-foot data center on land formerly set aside for Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group.

Foxconn’s plans didn’t come to fruition, but companies such as Boldt and Walsh Construction are building out the data center complex on land Microsoft bought.

The facility will hold “hundreds of thousands” of powerful NVIDIA general processing units, which will be used to train AI models. Smith said this will deliver “ten times the performance of today’s fastest supercomputers.” Microsoft officials said the Mount Pleasant facility will be the world’s most powerful AI data center.

“But what does that mean for the average Wisconsinite?” Smith wrote. “It means new jobs, new skills and new opportunities — right here at home. From union construction roles to long-term careers in operations and IT, this facility is creating pathways for Wisconsinites to be part of the future of technology. It means students at Gateway Technical College can train for high-demand roles through Wisconsin’s first Datacenter Academy. It means local companies — from manufacturers to startups — can partner with Microsoft engineers to turn AI ideas into real solutions.”

More than 90% of the facility will use a closed-loop liquid cooling system which will be filled during construction and continuously recirculated, officials said. The rest will use outside air for cooling and switch to water on the hottest days to minimize environmental impact, officials added.

Microsoft will pre-pay for energy and electrical infrastructure to offset costs for ratepayers and match kilowatt hours used by fossil fuel with renewables, officials said. A 250-megawatt solar project under construction in Portage County will help with matching, officials said.

The first data center used more than 3,000 construction workers at its peak, Microsoft officials said. When the first data center is open, it will hire around 500 full-time employees and will grow to 800 when the second is completed.

“Throughout our history, innovation has been the key to Wisconsin’s success, championing ideas of discoveries that have transformed people’s lives the world over, and this announcement is no different,” said Gov. Tony Evers in a statement. “Microsoft’s investment puts Wisconsin on the very cutting edge of AI power, not just in the U.S., but throughout the world, while creating good, family supporting jobs, growing our communities and bolstering our critical biohealth, personalized medicine and advanced manufacturing sectors here at home. We are grateful for Microsoft’s continued investment in our state and look forward to continuing to partner together to support Wisconsin’s workforce, economy and communities.”

First data center goes under environmental scrutiny

Microsoft’s data center will use 8.4 million gallons each year, data from the city of Racine showed.

In February, Milwaukee Riverkeeper requested information from the city under public records. Later, the Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit against the city to turn over project water use information. Racine’s water utility will provide Lake Michigan water for the data center campus under an agreement with Racine and Mount Pleasant.

The facility will hit peak daily use of 234,000 gallons of water each day when its first phase is completed in 2026, city data showed.

After future phases, the data center will use 702,000 gallons of water each day or 8.44 million gallons each year. This project is for when Areas 3B, 3A and 2 are built out.

The first phase (Area 3B) will see wastewater discharge of up to 81,000 gallons per day and more than 2 million each year. After all phases, the facility will discharge 243,000 gallons each day and more than 6 million each year.

“Data centers will have major implications for Wisconsin’s environment,” said Cheryl Nenn, lead at Milwaukee Riverkeeper. “Our ability to understand the impacts and protect our water resources depends on open and transparent government.”

The request “required additional review while the city worked with Microsoft and associated parties to ensure that the release of information would not violate contractual agreements,” wrote city of Racine officials. Officials pointed to the review for the delay and said their ultimate goal was transparency.

“Open and transparent government is not optional; it is essential to public trust,” said Racine Mayor Cory Mason in a statement. “While we needed time to ensure that we handled this request responsibly and in compliance with legal agreements, we believe transparency is paramount. The information has been released, and we remain committed to making all relevant government records accessible so our community can see how decisions are made and resources are used.”

In 2018, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources approved the city of Racine to divert up to 7 million gallons each day towards the former Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant.

The diverted water would be returned to the Great Lakes Basin through the Racine Wastewater Treatment Plant, DNR officials said.

The approval was granted under the Great Lakes — St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact, which banned diversions of Great Lakes water with a few exceptions, officials said. One exception was to allow a “straddling community” to receive Lake Michigan water if certain criteria were met. Mount Pleasant is classified as such a community.

The Microsoft data center in Mount Pleasant and Vantage Data Centers facility in Port Washington would require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of electricity, a September analysis by Clean Wisconsin found. That’s enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes. However, there are only 2.8 million housing units in the state, U.S. Census data showed.

Mount Pleasant and Port Washington data centers were two of five proposed data center projects which publicly shared their electricity needs. Proposals are underway for Beaver Dam, Vienna and Red Cedar.

“To put this in perspective, that is more than three times the power production capacity of Wisconsin’s Point Beach nuclear reactor,” said Paul Mathewson, science program director at Clean Wisconsin. “And because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Microsoft.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:03:35.304668

The City of Tallahassee is proud to announce it has received the Sunrise Award and Redevelopment Award from the Florida Brownfields Association (FBA), recognizing its commitment to environmental stewardship, community engagement and sustainable growth.

These prestigious awards spotlight the City's successful Brownfields program, which is recognized as one of the most successful in Florida and the southeastern United States. Through this program, the City has secured over $3 million in grant funding from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) since 1997 to turn underused, environmentally impacted sites into thriving community assets.

Brownfields are properties where the perception or presence of environmental contamination hinder growth and development. Cleaning up brownfield properties improves the environment, facilitates job growth, utilizes existing infrastructure, increases the local tax base and enables redevelopment opportunities.

The Sunrise Award recognizes the most impactful brownfields redevelopment projects in the state of Florida that successfully leverage multi-stakeholder partnerships to bring about positive change. The Redevelopment Award celebrates innovative, transformative projects that are models of resilience, environmental responsibility and strategic reuse.

The centerpiece of this dual achievement is the transformation of Cascades Park, a former polluted Superfund alternative site, into a nationally recognized park known as a vibrant cultural and recreational destination that also houses vital stormwater infrastructure.

""This achievement highlights the City's leadership in turning environmental challenges into opportunities for economic vitality and community pride,"" Deputy City Manager Karen Jumonville said. ""The dedication and expertise of staff in the transformation of Cascades Park exemplifies the power of brownfields redevelopment to restore contaminated land and revitalize communities.""

Through collaboration by the City of Tallahassee, Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency, EPA, FDEP and private stakeholders, this once-polluted site was remediated and repurposed into a thriving community asset that has spurred more than $300 million in private investment.

As part of the City's 2025-2029 Strategic Plan, the City will complete 25 environmental assessments, remediation or redevelopment projects at brownfield sites throughout the City.

These declarations are not merely procedural — they carry significant operational, regulatory, and environmental implications for Louisiana industry.

LDEQ may issue an emergency declaration in anticipation of, or immediately following, a major weather event such as a hurricane. This action is typically coordinated with the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness and other state and federal agencies. The declaration is based on expected or actual disruptions that could affect facility operations, public safety, environmental protection, and access to resources.

The declaration allows LDEQ to temporarily modify or suspend certain regulatory requirements. These modifications are intended to ensure continuity of critical operations, facilitate rapid response and recovery efforts, and prevent more significant environmental or public health consequences. Common elements addressed in a declaration include fuel storage and transfer, wastewater management, air emissions, debris management, and reporting deadlines.

Once a declaration is issued, facilities may apply for emergency authorizations or waivers. These requests must be submitted to LDEQ and should clearly demonstrate a hurricane-related need — for example, a power outage preventing normal emissions controls or the need to bypass wastewater treatment during flooding. While LDEQ provides flexibility, it still expects facilities to minimize environmental harm and to document any deviations from permit conditions.

In many cases, LDEQ may issue a general administrative order or preauthorized contingency relief to certain sectors, such as refineries, chemical manufacturers, and utilities. These orders typically outline what actions are permitted during the emergency and under what conditions. It is crucial that facility personnel review and understand these documents, as noncompliance — even during a declared emergency — can still result in enforcement action if the terms of the relief are not followed.

While LDEQ’s emergency declarations offer much-needed flexibility, they do not exempt facilities from all responsibility. Facilities remain accountable for actions that result in preventable releases, environmental damage, or public harm. Post-event reporting is typically required, and LDEQ may conduct inspections or request documentation after the emergency has passed.

It is important for Louisiana industry to proactively review emergency response plans, ensure environmental compliance procedures are adaptable to emergency conditions, and maintain open lines of communication with LDEQ. Early engagement with LDEQ can improve a facility’s ability to respond effectively and legally during a hurricane.

LDEQ’s emergency declarations are vital tools for managing environmental risks during hurricanes. By understanding the declaration process, complying with the conditions of any regulatory relief, and maintaining proactive communication, industrial facility managers can better protect their operations, the environment, and the communities they serve. Preparation, flexibility, and compliance are key to navigating hurricane-related emergencies with resilience and responsibility.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-09/Louisiana%20LA%20Flag-457944407.jpg.webp?itok=BVWpI79U,N,,2025-09-19 15:02:56.649842

The executive order directs State Land to develop a report within 30 days outlining proposals to streamline and expedite processes for energy infrastructure development on state land. State Land will also be directed to identify and accelerate energy-related projects already underway.

“Arizona is on the frontlines of the American power resurgence, creating the affordable energy future,” said Gov. Hobbs. “We have incredible potential to deliver affordable energy to every business and family who needs it. We just need to unleash it. We’re going to cut away the bureaucracy and red tape that too often holds our economy back and increase costs. With this executive order, we will put common sense before outdated policies and procedures and build the energy infrastructure Arizona needs.”

The executive order also establishes the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce, which will develop plans to facilitate large-scale growth, while preventing significant increases in Arizonans’ energy costs, expand Arizona’s clean energy economy and identify opportunities to streamline processes to site and develop energy infrastructure projects.

In addition to establishing the Taskforce, Gov. Hobbs’ executive order leverages state resources and directs state agencies to:

Develop an energy affordability study to identify opportunities to reduce consumers’ energy costs and expand energy affordability programs.

Analyze transportation fuel affordability and opportunities to plan for EV adoption.

Provide support for energy-related businesses impacted by changes to federal policy.

Support Tribes in advancing energy sovereignty.

Identify ways to reduce energy costs and lower energy use.

This executive order comes at a critical moment. Recent federal actions, including the repeal of clean energy tax credits and new obstacles delaying the deployment of solar and wind projects, have put jobs and energy developments at risk. Moreover, Arizona utilities estimate significant energy needs over the next 15 years, with some utilities projecting a 40% increase in peak demand.

“This executive order focuses on giving Arizona families the affordable and innovative energy future they want and deserve. It also helps Arizona continue on its trajectory to becoming an energy and manufacturing leader. The solutions that will stem from this EO come at a pivotal time, as energy costs and the uncertainty about future energy demand increase,” said Maren Mahoney, director of the Governor’s Office of Resiliency. “It’s an honor to help lead the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce and ensure Arizona thrives for many generations to come.”

More than 40 organizations urge Governor Newsom to pass SB 787 and Support Clean Heat Pump, Battery, and Off-shore Wind Supply Chains in California

Los Angeles, Calif. — Today, Public Citizen joined the United Auto Workers and over 40 organizations urging Governor Newsom to sign SB 787 into law. The California State Assembly on Friday voted in favor of SB 787, which would create an Industrial Policy Council in the California Energy Commission. The council would coordinate agencies and stakeholders to support clean energy supply chains for three key sectors across the state: heat pumps, batteries, and off-shore wind.

“While Trump takes the country back to the time of coal barons, awful labor conditions, and extreme pollution, California—the world’s fourth largest economy—has an opportunity to support creating critical clean technology supply chains in the state,” said David Arkush, director of Public Citizen’s Climate Program. “We urge Governor Newsom to ensure California remains a global leader in clean industry development by signing SB 787 into law.”

“UAW is committed to an equitable vision for decarbonizing California’s economy. Part of that vision is growing good union manufacturing jobs in the industries of the future, while accelerating clean energy deployment and bringing down the price of energy for working class Californians,” said Mike Miller, Director of UAW Region 6, which represents 100,000 members across various industries in California. “With SB 787, we’ve sponsored a bill championed by Senator McNerney that will go a long way towards reaching these critical goals in an affordable manner. We’re proud to be joined by a broad coalition of unions, environmentalists, businesses, community groups, counties, utilities, and other organizations who have linked arms in supporting this common sense measure.”

California has established ambitious goals for building a green economy that accelerates the deployment of affordable clean energy and provides quality jobs. However, the state lacks a comprehensive approach to building the clean energy supply chains and workforce needed to achieve its goals.

SB 787 formalizes partnerships between state agencies, labor, environmental organizations, and clean energy industries to coordinate supply chain development for batteries, including electric vehicle and grid-scale batteries, along with building decarbonization technologies and offshore wind.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor When electricity demand in New England is relatively high, electricity imports from Canada have a key role in meeting that demand.
For example, in January 2025, the month winter demand peaked in ISO-NE, Canada provided an average of 14% of ISO-NE electricity demand.
Between 2016 and 2022, Canadian electricity imports provided 11% of NYISO electricity.
Through August 31, 2025, Canadian electricity imports remained about 2% of NYISO electricity demand.","Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor

Over the past few years, net electricity inflows from Canada into New York (New York Independent System Operator, or NYISO) and New England (Independent System Operator of New England, or ISO-NE) have decreased. We identified this trend in an analysis in 2024, and the trend has continued through the first eight months of 2025. From January through August 2025, daily net electricity imports from Canada into ISO-NE averaged less than 40% of those occurring over the same months in 2022. During the same period, NYISO and Canada net trade fell to 25% what it was during the same months of 2022.

Two factors contributed to the falling imports from Canada. First, drought conditions have led to less hydropower electricity generation in Canada throughout most of the past three years. Despite parts of Canada receiving above average rainfall in July, drought conditions have persisted across much of the country, according to the Canadian government’s Drought Monitor. Second, electricity demand in both ISO-NE and NYISO has fallen. Between 2016 and 2024, electricity demand in ISO-NE fell 9%, and demand in NYISO fell 6%.

Although NYISO and ISO-NE typically import electricity from Canada, the shifting trends have led to multiple days of net electricity exports into Canada from the two ISOs. Net electricity exports from these two grid operators to Canada are more common in the shoulder seasons (spring and fall) when electricity demand in the U.S. Northeast is relatively low. In summer and winter, relatively high electricity demand in the U.S. Northeast limits the electricity available for export.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor

When electricity demand in New England is relatively high, electricity imports from Canada have a key role in meeting that demand. For example, in January 2025, the month winter demand peaked in ISO-NE, Canada provided an average of 14% of ISO-NE electricity demand. But the average over the first eight months of 2025 was 5%. In previous years, Canada contributed a higher share of electricity, providing an average of 14% of ISO-NE’s electricity between 2016 and 2022. That share fell to 11% in 2023 and to 5% in 2024.

ISO-NE first exported more electricity than it imported from Canada, becoming a net exporter, on a daily basis in February 2023. Daily net exports have become increasingly common, occurring 49 times in 2024 and 20 times through August 31 in 2025, according to data collected in our Hourly Electric Grid Monitor.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Hourly Electric Grid Monitor

As in ISO-NE, Canadian electricity imports to NYISO are an important component in meeting electricity demand, but the amount of electricity imported from Canada has decreased in recent years. Between 2016 and 2022, Canadian electricity imports provided 11% of NYISO electricity. In 2023, that share fell to 5%, and in 2024 it fell to 3%. Through August 31, 2025, Canadian electricity imports remained about 2% of NYISO electricity demand. In August 2025, NYISO was a net exporter to Canada every day except for three during the month.

NYISO was a daily net exporter of electricity to Canada for the first time in July 2023. In 2024, NYISO was a net exporter to Canada for 87 days. In 2025, through the end of August, NYISO was a daily net exporter 86 times.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/TIE09192025.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:07:03.368379

Key Considerations Manufacturers of plastics and those who use plastic components in any part of their processes should consider the following.","In both cases, environmental groups allege that the defendants have been releasing small plastic pellets, called nurdles, into waterways without a permit. In the Pennsylvania case, environmentalists accused Styropek USA, Inc., an expanded polystyrene manufacturer, of discharging nurdles into a tributary of the Ohio River. As part of a settlement with the plaintiffs and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Styropek agreed to install monitoring and control equipment and to pay $2.5 million for watershed restoration.

Soon after, environmentalists in South Carolina issued a citizen suit letter to two companies allegedly discharging nurdles into the Congaree River. The increased attention to nurdle releases raises the possibility of additional citizen suit activity in the near future.

South Carolina Citizen Suit Summary

In February, an environmental group, Congaree Riverkeepers, first began collecting nurdles near Columbia, South Carolina. The Riverkeepers assert that a polyester factory operated by Alpek Polyester USA, LLC and Eastman Chemical Company has been releasing nurdles, 1,4-dioxane, and organic matter into the Congaree River.

The CWA forbids the discharge of any pollutant without a permit. 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a). The Act defines a “pollutant” to include solid waste discharged into water, which can include solid plastic. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(6). The Riverkeepers allege that Alpek and Eastman have been discharging nurdles and 1,4-dioxane without a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.

The Riverkeepers also accuse Alpek and Eastman of violating the RCRA. The RCRA allows citizen suits against a defendant for the handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste that may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to health or the environment. 42 U.S.C. § 6972(a)(1)(B). It also forbids the disposal of solid or hazardous waste in an “open dump”—anywhere outside a proper landfill. 42 U.S.C. §§ 6945(a), 6903(14). The RCRA defines “solid waste” to include discarded material from industrial operations. 42 U.S.C. § 6903(14). The Riverkeepers contend that Alpek and Eastman’s nurdles harm fish in the river and the people who eat them. They also say that the plant’s wastewater treatment system is located within a floodplain and therefore results in open dumping.

Unless regulators act within 60 days, we expect litigation. The Riverkeepers’ case may be yet another model for environmental plaintiffs seeking to limit plastic pollution.

Pennsylvania Settlement Summary

In the Pennsylvania case, the plaintiffs alleged that Styropek released nurdles into a river without authority under Styropek’s NPDES permit. As part of the proposed settlement, Styropek agreed to install equipment to prevent and monitor future releases. Styropek also agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty, $2 million for plastic remediation, $500,000 for watershed restoration, and $375,000 in attorney’s fees. The environmental plaintiffs who brought the suit suggested the settlement could set a framework that could be copied across the country.

The Pennsylvania settlement is the third settlement related to plastic pollution in waterways. In 2019, Formosa Plastics Corp. agreed to retrofit its facility and pay $50 million after it allegedly discharged nurdles into Lavaca Bay in excess of its permit conditions. In 2021, Frontier Logistics agreed to pay $1.2 million to settle a lawsuit after nurdles washed into Charleston Harbor.

Supply chain decarbonisation Mars aims to integrate sustainable practices not only in its confectionery and pet food production, but also across its wider supply chain.
By collaborating with Enel, Mars enhances its efforts to decarbonise, particularly through the Renewable Acceleration programme.
""For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches.
These contracts exemplify a transformative approach to the supply chain, potentially inspiring similar actions among other manufacturers, furthering the cause of global sustainability in procurement and supply management.","Mars is taking steps to enhance its Renewable Acceleration programme by teaming up with energy partner Enel.

The multinational manufacturer is dedicated to implementing sustainable practices, considering everything from building partnerships with NGOs to the responsible sourcing of raw materials.

Since introducing its Generation Plan in 2017, Mars has been actively working to ensure it is a positive force for the world.

Supply chain decarbonisation

Mars aims to integrate sustainable practices not only in its confectionery and pet food production, but also across its wider supply chain.

By collaborating with Enel, Mars enhances its efforts to decarbonise, particularly through the Renewable Acceleration programme.

“Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture,” says Kevin Rabinovitch, Global VP Sustainability at Mars.

""For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches. It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.""

Suppliers will shift to renewable energy and trucks transporting ingredients and finished products will transition to EVs, exemplifying Mars' commitment to sustainable procurement.

Alastair Child, Chief Sustainability Officer at Mars, adds: ""[The partnership with Enel] means sourcing renewable electricity to cover everything from the farms that grow our ingredients, to the trucks that deliver products, and even the energy used by consumers at home to enjoy their favourite Mars products, like Ben’s Original and SNICKERS Ice Cream or at their BANFIELD veterinarian’s office.

""By implementing this strategy, we could cut around three million tons of carbon emissions from the Mars full value chain, amounting to an estimated 10% of our current total footprint. This is a huge unlock for decarbonisation and we’re just getting started.""

The adoption of renewable electricity is an accessible and cost-effective strategy for decarbonisation, and is well received publicly and by businesses alike. Direct operations under the Mars name use about 2 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually.

However, the full value chain, including suppliers, customers and consumers, requires 8-9TWh, indicating the vast scope of the Renewable Acceleration programme to reduce emissions.

Developing sustainable value chains

The inaugural contract in this programme, spanning Mars and Enel North America, stands as a testament to Mars' dedication to sustainable energy, setting its largest precedent in global power purchase agreements (PPA) with a commercial and industrial client.

“Renewable Acceleration is a bold initiative to support the buildout of more clean energy capacity, which we know is among the fastest and most economical ways to decarbonise,” asserts Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America.

“Mars is raising the bar for corporate sustainability strategies, taking a comprehensive and direct approach to addressing emissions across its entire value chain. Enel is proud to partner with Mars in launching this new programme.”

Mars continues to fortify its procurement and supply strategies through diversified renewable energy contracts with global companies, facilitating its suppliers' transition towards decarbonisation.

Strategic energy resilience

Mars’ approach manifests its commitment to fostering robust and effective supply chains through strategic partnerships that bolster both energy resilience and supplier relationships.

By not relying on a single provider, Mars enhances its capability to meet decarbonisation goals more expediently.

The initial trilogy of contracts with Enel is projected to generate a cumulative 1.8TWh annually, reducing approximately 700ktCO₂e each year. With continued collaboration and contracting, Mars anticipates achieving a 10% reduction in its total carbon footprint by 2030.

These contracts exemplify a transformative approach to the supply chain, potentially inspiring similar actions among other manufacturers, furthering the cause of global sustainability in procurement and supply management.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/62a82981ab16dd951068ad0990034462:bb2455a98e9e7bd321a36d36f148c8ad/aurora-solar-farm-dual-use-solar-min.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 17:01:33.931649

Energy security: Closer coordination with the UK diversifies global supply chains, reduces reliance on Russian fuel, and strengthens Western resilience against hostile suppliers.
For the U.S., it would reinforce leadership in an industry critical to economic growth, energy security, and climate goals.","Over the past three years, global energy markets have been rocked by successive crises.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, European nations — and the UK in particular — were forced to go “cold turkey” off Russian natural gas, severing a supply chain that had underpinned electricity and heating for decades. That scramble collided with an unprecedented heatwave in the UK’s early summer, straining grids, sending prices soaring, and exposing the fragility of over-reliance on imported fossil fuels.

These shocks underscored a hard truth: energy security is national security. Countries that cannot depend on their own supply — or on trusted allies — risk economic disruption, political instability, and a diminished ability to protect their citizens when geopolitics shift. We wrote about these geopolitical events previously.

Against this backdrop, the United Kingdom and the United States have launched an ambitious new phase of cooperation to accelerate nuclear power development on both sides of the Atlantic. The new Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, expected to be signed during President Trump’s state visit to London, marks a major step toward unlocking the next generation of clean, secure energy.

By streamlining licensing and encouraging private investment, the partnership aims to shorten the time it takes to build new reactors—from three or four years for regulatory approvals to as little as two. That would mean more jobs, faster deployment, and greater energy security for both nations.

A transatlantic energy alliance

By combining the two countries’ innovation, investment and industrial sites, as well as more aligned regulatory oversight, the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy aims to offer:

Lower costs and shorter schedules through mutual recognition of safety reviews.

Robust supply chains, including advanced fuels and reactor components, that bypass hostile actors and improve resilience.

Shared R&D on fission and fusion, harnessing AI tools and joint test facilities to accelerate breakthroughs.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the partnership “a golden age of nuclear,” while U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright highlighted how cooperation will “enhance global energy security” and “fuel the AI revolution.”

Key announcements driving the partnership

Several commercial agreements were unveiled alongside the government-to-government framework. Together, they signal a wave of investment in advanced reactors, fuels, and clean power applications.

X-Energy and Centrica – Plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors at Hartlepool, creating as many as 2,500 skilled jobs. The full UK programme could deliver 6 GW of capacity, power 1.5 million homes, and generate £40 billion in economic value—£12 billion of which would flow to the North East.

Holtec, EDF and Tritax – A proposal to develop data centres powered by small modular reactors on the site of the former Cottam coal station in Nottinghamshire. The £11 billion project could employ thousands during construction and create long-term operations roles.

Last Energy and DP World – One of the world’s first micro-modular nuclear plants to supply clean power to DP World’s London Gateway port and logistics park, backed by £80 million in private investment.

Urenco and Radiant – A £4 million deal to supply advanced HALEU fuel to the U.S. market. Urenco’s new Advanced Fuels Facility in the UK, co-funded by government, may become a model for similar plants in the United States.

TerraPower and KBR – A collaboration to study and evaluate UK sites for deploying the Natrium advanced reactor, each unit supporting about 1,600 construction jobs and 250 permanent jobs while pairing reliable nuclear power with grid-scale energy storage.

Why this matters

For the current U.S. Administration, the Atlantic Partnership is more than a gesture of friendship—it’s a way to meet strategic and economic goals at home. The same goes for the UK, with the partnership expected to create tens of thousands of high-quality jobs in regions which have historically been overlooked.

Among other things, the more U.S. and UK technology is deployed, the more first-of-a-kind costs are driven down, and the stronger the commercial offering—both domestically and abroad--become:

Grid reliability & clean energy: Nuclear power offers firm, carbon-free electricity to complement renewables and meet surging demand from AI, data centers, and electrified transport.

Industrial competitiveness: Building and exporting advanced reactors creates thousands of highly skilled jobs in engineering, construction, operations, and supply-chain manufacturing.

Energy security: Closer coordination with the UK diversifies global supply chains, reduces reliance on Russian fuel, and strengthens Western resilience against hostile suppliers.

Innovation leadership: Bilateral projects—like Natrium, advanced SMRs, and HALEU fuel supply—position companies from both countries at the forefront of next-generation nuclear technology.

Climate and decarbonization goals: Meeting emissions targets will require reliable zero-carbon power alongside renewables; nuclear is the only large-scale option already proven.

Conclusion

The UK–U.S. deal could transform the pace of nuclear deployment in the UK, the U.S., and abroad. For Britain, it could provide a route to affordable, clean, homegrown energy and thousands of well-paid jobs. For the U.S., it would reinforce leadership in an industry critical to economic growth, energy security, and climate goals.

How an executive order is different from a law

Feature Executive Order Law (Statute)

Origin Issued unilaterally by the President to manage the federal government.

Passed by a majority vote in both the House and Senate, then signed by the President. Constitutional basis

Must be based on authority granted to the President by the Constitution (Article II) or an existing federal statute.

Directly enabled by the legislative powers given to Congress in the Constitution (Article I).

Scope of authority Used to direct federal agencies on how to implement or enforce existing laws and manage the executive branch. Cannot be used to create new laws or appropriate money. Can cover a broad range of topics, including creating new programs, making new crimes, and authorizing spending. Overturning

Can be rescinded by the issuing President or a future one. Can only be overturned by passing new legislation or by a court finding it unconstitutional.

Judicial review Federal courts can strike down an executive order if it is found to exceed the President's authority or be unconstitutional. Federal courts can strike down a law if it is found to be unconstitutional, a process called judicial review. Public vs. federal workers

Primarily binds and directs employees within the executive branch. However, it can affect the public by changing how federal agencies operate. Binds the entire nation and applies to all people.

Limits on executive orders While a powerful tool, a President's use of executive orders is not unlimited and is subject to the system of checks and balances:

Judicial review: The federal courts can invalidate an executive order that they find unconstitutional or beyond the President's legal authority. A famous example is the Supreme Court striking down President Truman's executive order to seize steel mills in 1952, determining it was an overreach of his power.

Congressional action: Though challenging, Congress can pass legislation that overrides or defunds an executive order. This legislation would require a two-thirds majority in both houses to overcome a presidential veto. Congress can also refuse to fund initiatives directed by an executive order, effectively killing it.

Future presidents: A new President can easily revoke the executive orders of a predecessor. This means their effects can be temporary, changing with each new administration.",,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:24.072229

Renewable energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy in 2024. However, future growth could be in jeopardy, according to the 10th annual Clean Jobs America report released by E2.

The report showed that the renewable energy sector added almost 100,000 new jobs, bringing the total number of renewable energy workers in the United States to 3.56 million. However, policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth in 2024 led to the growth in renewable energy jobs dropping to its slowest pace since 2020, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023.

Still, jobs in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage and grid and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, and make up an increasingly larger share of the overall U.S. workforce. More than 7% of all new jobs added in the United States and 82% of all new energy jobs added last year were in renewable energy occupations.

E2’s 10th annual Clean Jobs America report comes as the clean energy industry is reeling from recent federal policy decisions to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape and legal hurdles aimed at hobbling solar, wind, electric vehicles and other industries. These federal policy assaults come even as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the fastest-growing occupations in America are wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled more than $22 billion planned clean energy related factories and other projects that were expected to create 16,500 new jobs. Analysis by other organizations estimate more than 830,000 jobs could be lost just because of the energy policy rollbacks in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy,”

According to E2’s report, clean energy jobs now account for 42% of all energy jobs in America and 2.3% of the overall national workforce. More people now work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers.

More than 520,000 jobs have now been added by the clean energy and clean vehicle sectors over the last five years, an increase of 17% — far exceeding employment gains in fossil fuels, gas and diesel motor vehicles, and the overall U.S. economy.

While the sector added the fewest jobs since the pandemic-fueled unemployment crisis, clean energy still grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. workforce (2.8% vs. 0.8%) amid an economy-wide slowdown in hiring and rising policy uncertainty. Over the last five years, clean energy companies have added jobs 60% faster than the rest of the economy.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications for E2. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce. The strength of the U.S. job market and the future of our energy economy are now inseparable from the growth of clean energy.”

Energy efficiency remains the top sector for U.S. clean energy jobs, employing nearly 2.4 million workers nationwide after adding 91,000 jobs in 2024. That’s followed by renewable generation (569,000 overall, +9,000 in 2024) and clean vehicles (398,000 overall, -12,000 in 2024). Despite an industry-wide decline across all motor vehicle sectors in 2024, clean vehicle jobs have grown 52% since 2020, adding 137,000 jobs.

Over the past five years, no region added more clean energy jobs and at a faster rate than the South — now home to more than 1 million clean energy workers. From Texas to Virginia, Southern states added 41,000 clean energy jobs in 2024. Western and Northeastern states added more than 20,000 jobs respectively. The Midwest added more than 13,000 jobs. See a detailed regional breakdown in the full report.

At the state level, clean energy continues to drive economic prosperity. Twenty-three states are home to at least 50,000 clean energy jobs and just eight states have more workers employed by fossil fuels than clean energy.

Seventeen states have seen their clean energy workforces jump at least 20% in the last five years. See table below for more detail.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors. In addition, the 2025 USEER relies on a unique supplemental survey of 42,800 business representatives across the United States. Created and conducted by BW Research, the methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This survey is used to identify energy-related employment within key subsectors of the broader industries as classified by the BLS and to assign them into their component energy and energy efficiency sectors.

A full methodology on the sectors and types of jobs this analysis includes and does not include is available in the report here.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, VPPs are networks of small energy generation sites — think hundreds of homes with rooftop solar — that are combined with storage technologies like home batteries and electric vehicles. VPPs can help grid operators manage peak demand, improve affordability, and bolster grid resilience by taking some of the strain off of centralized power plants, especially during times of peak demand.

The use of solar+storage helped many communities during Hurricane Helene in Fall 2024. As we approach the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Helene, we want to take time to showcase a solutions-based program for the Carolinas: Duke Energy in North Carolina’s VPP pilot program, PowerPair, which provides an incentive for solar+storage systems for residential customers.

PowerPair Basics

The intent of the PowerPair pilot program is to reduce Duke Energy’s peak demand by making solar+storage systems more affordable, incentivizing more customers to add solar+storage to their homes. The pilot program also increases resilience since solar+storage systems can continue to run even in a system outage. This is a 3-year pilot. Customers have until the end of 2027 to apply. Participants are required to participate for 10 years. Incentive levels vary depending on rate structure and utility battery control, with the maximum rebate being $9,000 per residence. Remaining program capacity is updated periodically on the PowerPair website.

The pilot consists of two cohorts.

Cohort A is for residents who would like to control their battery themselves. These participants are on a time-of-use rate schedule that encourages them to reduce their utility-fed electricity usage during times of peak demand when it is most expensive for the utility to meet customers’ needs.

Cohort B allows Duke Energy to control the customer’s battery and provides the customer with an additional monthly incentive.

A Missed Opportunity to Incentivize Resilience for Medical Device Households

As an additional resilience measure, a Cohort C Medical Device Pilot was also discussed throughout 2024/2025. The intent of the medical device pilot would have provided incentives specifically for solar+storage for individuals with a medical device. This would make these particularly vulnerable dwellings more resilient and allow these customers to shelter in place when there is a power outage. A great example of this working is a Savannah, GA homeowner who uses a sleep apnea machine and was able to shelter in place during Hurricane Helene. Unfortunately, despite efforts by SACE and others, in July 2025, Duke Energy notified the NC Utility Commission that, even though the costs of such a program would be fairly modest, Duke could not find a way to pay for the Cohort C Medical Device pilot program. Households with medical devices can, of course, still participate in the Cohort A or B pilot program, but without additional incentives.

How can I participate?

To participate in PowerPair, Duke Energy North Carolina customers select a Trade Ally, which is a contractor that has met the requirements to partner with Duke Energy. The Trade Ally helps the customer complete an Interconnection Request and program application, which is reviewed and approved within 10 business days. Once the installation is completed by the Trade Ally, required documentation is submitted, eligibility requirements are verified, and billing has started, the customer will receive the one-time PowerPair incentive payment. More information is available on the PowerPair website.

VPPs Can Support Resilient Communities Throughout the Southeast

VPPs throughout the Southeast are a great way to provide resilience, as shown in NC and FL during Hurricane Helene. In addition to providing resilience for customers, these programs reduce usage during periods when it is most expensive for the utility to provide service, thereby lowering utility bills for all customers. Duke Energy is leading by example with the PowerPair pilot, and the Georgia Public Service Commission recently approved a similar Georgia Power Company pilot as part of their 2025 Integrated Resource Plan. We encourage other Southeast utilities to follow in Duke Energy and Georgia Power’s footsteps and provide the opportunity for resilience and peak demand assistance for their customers.

I didn’t gamble a single cent or pay for a sip of a drink, but the trip out to Las Vegas for RE+ completely wiped me out.

The long flights and days spent shuffling around the Venetian and Caesar’s Forum were well worth it, though, and as I shamble back into the saddle and transcribe quotes from the event, I’m picking up on some prominent themes. The prevalent one is optimistic: the tailwind of increasing electricity demand is strong enough to ensure the U.S. renewable energy industry survives and thrives, despite headwinds from the federal government.

Kevin Smith, CEO of independent power producer (IPP) Arevon, put it succinctly.

“Solar and battery storage are best positioned, with or without tax credits,” he told me. “And the industry feels that because projects are still continuing to move forward, there’s still demand from utilities.”

Smith anticipates a more acute supply vs. demand situation to emerge in late 2026 and into 2027; keep your eyes on Factor This for more on that in a future article.

Catalyze Brings Community Solar Online in New York

This week, fully-integrated distributed renewable energy asset developer and IPP Catalyze announced the completion of four community solar projects in central and western New York. The projects are located in Pavilion, Phelps, Fonda, and Fabius (sounds like a cool name for a law firm!) and were developed in partnership with CS Energy. Combined, they account for 27 megawatts (MW) of capacity.

According to Catalyze, the projects leveraged standardized design, a consistent racking system, and trusted subcontractor relationships, allowing teams to accelerate schedules and bring power online as fast as possible. Construction access and laydown areas were carefully managed so that farmland could return to its pre-existing condition, allowing landowners to continue farming outside the solar arrays. The installations, built with prevailing wage labor, were supported by New York State programs including the Inclusive Community Solar Adder and the Community Adder, which help ensure reliable energy access to low-to-moderate income (LMI) subscribers and disadvantaged communities.

“Our work with CS Energy shows what’s possible when states, developers, and communities align,” said Andrew D’Amico, Chief Operating Officer at Catalyze. “This milestone is about more than megawatts; it’s about taking action. We are seeing businesses move fast to lock in the long-term benefits and cost advantages of solar power while federal tax credits are still in place, with states offering incentives designed to expand access.”

The timing of these projects, as D’Amico points out, highlights the importance of acting quickly to secure federal tax incentives while they’re still around. Current solar investment tax credits cover 30% of project costs, with potential bonuses of 10% for domestic content and an additional 10% for projects in designated energy communities.

This marks the halfway point of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze and CS Energy. The remaining projects, totaling more than 25 MW, are scheduled for completion over the next year. Last October, New York reached its goal of installing 6 gigawatts (GW) of distributed solar ahead of schedule.

Enel Signs Largest-Ever Power Purchase Agreement

Enel North America is going to Mars! Or rather, Mars is coming to Enel… for power.

Late last week, Enel signed three power purchase agreements (PPAs) for the full output of a trio of Texas solar farms with Mars Incorporated (yes, the candy bar company). The deals represent Enel’s largest corporate PPA transaction worldwide. Combined, the agreements represent 851 MWac and are expected to yield 1.8 terawatt-hours of electricity each year.

Vegetation at all three sites will be managed through sheep grazing, a sustainable dual-use solar practice that Enel expanded through the largest solar grazing agreement signed in the United States. Learn more about that deal and check out cute sheep pics here:

“This deal reinforces our commitment to decarbonization and shows how renewables are among the fastest and most affordable solutions to meet the nation’s energy needs. Through these agreements, we’re adding clean capacity to the Texas grid while supporting a leading manufacturer’s sustainability goals,” said Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America.

“Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture,” added Kevin Rabinovitch, Global VP Sustainability at Mars. “For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches. It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner. The more demand we create together, the faster we can build the future we all want. And clean energy means cleaner air for our communities, our people, our partners.”

Fourth Power Secures $20M for Utility-Scale Storage Solution

Startup flexible-duration energy storage provider Fourth Power has secured $20 million in Series A Plus funding led by Munich Re Ventures, with follow-on investments from DCVC and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

The funding will accelerate the commercial deployment of Fourth Power’s modular, utility-scale thermal energy storage system, supporting the commissioning of an integrated 1 MWh-e demonstration using full-scale commercial components, the company’s final step before customer deployments. Fourth Power also intends to use the influx of capital to deepen partnerships with suppliers and customers further and grow its customer pipeline.

“We’re in a race between the growing need for reliable electricity and the grid’s ability to provide it quickly and affordably. Existing solutions are too slow to deploy, too expensive for customers, and oftentimes both,” argued Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power. “Fourth Power offers a new path forward: scalable, flexible-duration energy storage built from abundant domestic materials. It’s how we deliver reliability at a price point that works—for energy providers, their customers, and the future of the grid.”

Since its $19 million Series A in 2023, Fourth Power has doubled its team size and claims it has achieved breakthrough engineering milestones that validate its commercial readiness. The company constructed three large-scale, accelerated life test rigs to validate the durability, safety, and lifetime performance of its subsystems at temperatures up to 2400°C. Further advances include demonstrating a self-lubricating graphite pump for moving molten tin, high-pressure-rated graphite fittings for liquid metal containment, and a scalable inert gas enclosure system.

“Fourth Power is solving a grid problem that’s very real and very near-term, and they’re doing it with a system that’s safer, cheaper, and dramatically more scalable than anything we’ve seen in this category,” stated Peter Ortez, principal at Munich Re Ventures. “We focus on companies tackling the biggest risks facing society. And we believe Fourth Power’s approach represents exactly the kind of resilient infrastructure investment the energy transition demands.”

The Northeast faces distinct challenges, including transportation electrification, aging infrastructure, renewable integration, grid modernization, and increasingly severe weather. DTECH® Northeast will assemble leading stakeholders to tackle these issues head-on, offering insights into cutting-edge technologies and strategies that ensure reliability, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. Join us in Boston, Massachusetts, from November 17-19, 2025!

Fourth Power’s thermal energy storage system works by converting electricity into heat using 2400°C liquid metal as a heat transfer fluid. It stores that energy in carbon blocks and converts it back to electricity using proprietary thermophotovoltaics (TPVs). The company’s use of very high-temperature liquid metal for heat transfer achieves high power density, reducing overall system costs. Fourth Power’s modular design separates power and energy, allowing utilities to add storage duration over time as needs change at just a fraction of the initial installation cost. This flexibility, which the company says is enabled by storage costs of less than $25/kWh-e, allows customers to “grow with the grid,” a key differentiator from lithium-ion batteries, where adding duration means duplicating the entire system.

“This technology doesn’t just incrementally improve on existing solutions, but completely reimagines how we approach the problem,” said Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “With energy demand rising rapidly, we need storage technologies that can scale cost-effectively alongside that growth. Fourth Power’s flexible-duration approach is that kind of infrastructure-grade solution.”

Fourth Power expects to announce its first commercial partnerships by 2027.

Jupiter Power Brings Michigan’s First Utility-Scale Battery Online

On Wednesday, Texas-based Jupiter Power and Michigan utility Consumers Energy hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the successful commercial operations of the Tibbits Energy Storage Facility, the first-of-its-size operational battery energy storage system (BESS) in the mitten state. The 100 MW, four-hour duration BESS is located in Coldwater Township.

In June 2024, Consumers Energy announced a long-term agreement to purchase 100 MW of capacity from the Tibbits facility to be built and operated by Jupiter Power. The project went online earlier this summer and is the first of several large-scale battery projects that Consumers Energy has in the works this decade.

“Jupiter is proud to have completed Michigan’s first utility-scale energy storage project, which will increase Consumers Energy’s supply of reliable, flexible energy solutions to meet customer needs and also bring many benefits to the Coldwater community,” said Jack Godshall, Chief Commercial Officer of Jupiter Power. “Tibbits puts Jupiter’s total battery storage projects now in operation or under construction at nearly 3GWh, and with more than 12GW of new projects in development, we have much more to do – including in Michigan.”

Jupiter Power is also advancing the proposed 100 MW Voyager Battery Storage project in Saline Township, supported by a long-term power purchase agreement with Consumers Energy.

Nexamp Attracts $350M for First Utility-Scale Projects

Nexamp, the largest community solar and commercial-scale distributed generation owner in the United States, has secured $350 million in financing from Macquarie Asset Management to support the construction of its first utility-scale solar and battery storage projects. In a separate transaction, the company also raised additional development capital from Nomura to advance earlier-stage projects and sustain a national pipeline of utility-scale opportunities.

The Macquarie deal is more about Nexamp’s near-term construction plans. It will enable Nexamp to advance a significant portion of its 6 GW pipeline, which has been under development since the company’s expansion into the utility-scale segment in 2021. According to Nexamp, the Nomura investment complements this structure by supplying flexible capital to support the development activities of its next tranche of utility-scale projects.

“Access to capital across both development and construction is essential for building the scale of projects that today’s energy market demands,” said Zaid Ashai, Chairman and CEO of Nexamp. “These financings, secured from two world-class partners, ensure that Nexamp can both deliver on the near-term buildout of utility-scale solar and storage and invest in the development pipeline that will power the next phase of growth. This is about building a durable platform that meets the country’s rising demand for easy-to-deploy, more affordable energy.”

Macquarie’s financing will facilitate the construction of more than 1 GW (AC) of solar and storage projects across the high-demand MISO, ERCOT, and NYISO markets, while Nomura’s capital will advance development activities in MISO, NYISO, and PJM, three of the nation’s fastest-growing regions for utility-scale renewables. PEI Global Partners served as financial advisor to Nexamp on both transactions.

Sol Systems Scores $80M for Project Pipeline

Growing IPP Sol Systems has announced an initial commitment from Great Bay Renewables (GBR) of approximately $80 million in interconnection letters of credit (LCs) supporting Sol’s MISO portfolio. The revolving facility will be used to post refundable milestone deposits to MISO and, subsequently, to support readiness deposits in PJM.

“Interconnection is a bottleneck for U.S. clean energy deployment,” noted Richard Romero, Chief Financial Officer of Sol Systems. “This facility lets us scale more efficiently by posting deposits with letters of credit rather than cash, so we can advance a broader, de-risked portfolio for our customers and capital partners. Great Bay Renewables understands today’s queue realities and structured a solution that meets the moment.”

Non-cash-collateralized LC capacity has historically been reserved for large, credit-rated platforms. By partnering with GBR, Sol gains balance-sheet efficiency comparable to the industry’s most prominent players while continuing to invest in rigorous upfront engineering and site selectivity. This non-cash-collateralized LC capacity enables Sol to advance a greater number of high-quality interconnection positions without tying up cash, supporting a larger, more diversified pipeline, and accelerating deployment as projects mature.

“The capital required for grid interconnection security is one of the largest impediments to energy project development,” added Frank Getman, CEO of Great Bay Renewables. “At Great Bay, we specialize in creating innovative financial solutions to solve these complex problems. Our interconnection financing frees up our partners’ balance sheets, enabling companies like Sol Systems to deploy their resources efficiently to build the projects that accelerate the growth of American industry.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FT-Template-19.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:09.123114

Texas House Bills 3809 and 3228 introduce significant changes to the decommissioning and recycling requirements for Battery Energy Storage Facilities (“BESFs”), Solar Power Facilities, and Wind Power Facilities in Texas. This legislation, effective for agreements entered into on or after September 1, 2025, mandates specific obligations for the removal and recycling of facility components. Here’s what you need to know to ensure compliance in your lease agreements.

Key Provisions of HB 3809: Battery Energy Storage Facilities

HB 3809, codified into law as Chapter 303 of the Texas Utilities Code, requires project lessees to undertake comprehensive decommissioning and recycling activities. The following requirements, which cannot be waived, include:

Equipment Removal:

Project lessees must remove all BESF equipment, transformers, substations, and cables to a depth of at least 3 feet below surface and fill any resulting holes with similar soil.

Project lessees must also remove overhead lines.

Upon landlord owners’ request, project lessees must remove roads, restore land to a tillable state, and reseed as appropriate.

Recycling and Disposal: Project lessees must reuse, recycle, or ship for recycling all recyclable facility components.

Project lessees must dispose of all components of the facility that are not practicably capable of being reused or recycled.

This includes the proper handling of both hazardous and non-hazardous materials to minimize environmental impact.

Not only must these recycling and disposal requirements be incorporated into a BESF lease, but they also should be included in any wind or solar lease that includes a BESF component.

Financial Assurance: The project lessees must also provide landlord owners with financial assurance covering the full cost of recycling or disposal of all facility components, less project salvage value (salvage value to exclude the amount pledged for debt) along with an estimate of these costs.

Costs and salvage value must be determined by an independent Texas-licensed engineer, with the initial estimate provided to the landlord owner on or before the 10th anniversary of the battery operations date and updated estimates provided every 5 years.

Financial assurance must be delivered by the earlier of (i) agreement termination or (ii) year 15 of the battery operations date and must remain sufficient and in place until the lessee’s decommissioning activities are completed.

Key Provisions of HB 3228: Wind or Solar Power Facilities

Chapters 301 and 302 of the Texas Utilities Code currently require both wind and solar projects to undertake comprehensive decommissioning activities. Under HB 3228, wind and solar project lessees are now required to undertake additional recycling activities for wind and solar power facilities, which include:

Recycling and Disposal: Project lessees must now collect, reuse, recycle, or ship for recycling all recyclable facility components.

Project lessees must dispose of all components of the facility that are not practicably capable of being reused or recycled.

This includes the proper handling of both hazardous and non-hazardous materials to minimize environmental impact.

Financial Assurance: HB 3228 amends the existing financial assurance requirements in Texas Utilities Code Section 301.0004 (for wind projects) and Section 302.0005 (for solar projects) to add the estimated amount of the costs of recycling and disposing of all components to the formula for calculating the amount of financial assurance. As revised, the financial assurance provided by project lessees shall be at least equal to the estimated amount by which the cost of removing the solar or wind facility from the property, recycling or disposing of all components, and restoring the property as required exceeds the salvage value of the solar or wind facility, less any portion of the value of the solar or wind facility pledged to secure outstanding debt.

Impact on Lease Agreements

The enactment of HB 3809 and HB 3228 necessitates a thorough review of existing and future lease agreements for BESFs, wind facilities, and solar facilities. Here are some key considerations:

Clarification of Responsibilities: Lease agreements must clearly delineate the responsibilities of each party concerning removal and recycling obligations. This clarity is essential to avoid disputes and ensure compliance with the new law.

Financial Planning: The requirement for financial assurance means that project lessees must engage in careful financial planning to meet these obligations. This may involve setting aside funds or securing bonds to cover potential costs.

Compliance with Environmental Standards: The recycling requirements underscore the need for compliance with environmental standards. Lease agreements should reflect these standards to ensure that all parties are aligned with the legislative intent.

Reviewing and Revising Lease Agreements

It is important to note that the changes to Chapter 301 and 302 and the new Chapter 303 of the Texas Utilities Code apply only to agreements entered into on or after the effective date of the Act, September 1, 2025. Agreements entered into before this date are governed by the law in effect at the time of the agreement. However, if amending, or amending and restating, a lease entered into prior to September 1, 2025, consider whether the new law applies.

Conclusion

The decommissioning and recycling requirements introduced via HB 3809 and HB 3228 marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for BESFs, wind, and solar power facilities in Texas. These new requirements emphasize the importance of comprehensive decommissioning and recycling practices and ensure that environmental standards are met and financial assurances are in place. As these changes have already taken effect, it is crucial for project lessees to review and update their lease agreements now to ensure compliance.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15872_4946.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:06:25.083612

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz has said the immigration raid will delay opening the battery plant by at least two to three months.
“Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.” The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said.
That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea.
The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.","ATLANTA (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.

As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.

The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S..

The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it’s still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.

Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz has said the immigration raid will delay opening the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.

Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia’s business advantages would “win out” in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.

“I’ve had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,” Kemp said. “And I’ve had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.”

Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.

“This situation doesn’t change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,” Stubbs wrote. “Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.”

The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. That would bring total investment in the auto plant to $10.3 billion, not counting the $4.3 billion that Hyundai and its joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution, are putting into the battery plant.

Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, Stewart said. Hyundai pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.

The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai’s plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.

Hyundai underlined a previous announcement to deepen its investment in robotics and said that by 2027 it would launch extended-range electric vehicles with gasoline motors to extend the range of its electric batteries to more than 600 miles (960 kilometers).",https://www.mypanhandle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2025/09/68cc664e927642.35566143.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-19 13:02:52.057928

Evers proclaimed September 15-19, 2025, as “National Clean Energy Week” across the state, highlighting the importance of building a robust 21st-century clean energy economy in Wisconsin that supports green jobs, bolsters the health of our state, and ensures the clean, sustainable future Wisconsinites deserve. A copy of the governor’s proclamation is available here.

This week, Gov. Evers also announced the release of the 2025 Clean Energy Plan Progress Report, underscoring achievements made over the last year to advance goals established by the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan. The progress report released today details Wisconsin’s advances in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through clean energy sources while also creating thousands of new jobs and lowering energy costs for families across Wisconsin, as well as investing in job training and apprenticeship programs in innovative industries and technologies. During 2025 the Year of the Kid, the progress report also highlights stories of youth-driven initiatives, helping to create a more sustainable future for Wisconsin.

Since Day One, the Evers Administration has been committed to promoting climate resilience and building a clean energy economy in the state. In 2019, in one of his first acts as governor, Gov. Evers joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing nearly 60 percent of the U.S. economy and 55 percent of the U.S. population. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers was appointed a co-chair of the Alliance after being the first governor from the Midwest to join the executive committee, which oversees the strategic direction of the bipartisan coalition of governors.

In addition to joining the Alliance in 2019 Gov. Evers signed Executive Order #38 to create the Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy (OSCE), charging the office with developing the Wisconsin Clean Energy Plan to promote the development and use of clean and renewable energy across the state, advance innovative sustainability solutions that improve the state’s economy and environment, and diversify the resources used to meet the state’s energy needs. The order also established the state’s goal to reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050 and charged the OSCE with ensuring the state is fulfilling the carbon reduction goals of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

RADIO ADDRESS

Audio File of Radio Address

Hey there, folks. Governor Tony Evers here.

This week, we’re celebrating National Clean Energy Week across the state to highlight our efforts to build the clean energy future Wisconsin deserves.

Folks, we don’t have to choose between mitigating climate change and protecting our environment and good-paying jobs and economic development—we can and should do both.

And a clean energy economy is as much about protecting the health of our communities as it is about protecting the health of our environment.

So, as governor, I’ve made protecting our environment and investing in a clean energy economy to support our 21st-century needs a top priority of my administration since Day One.

We’ve joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, created a Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy, and developed our state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan.

We also created the Green Ribbon Commission on Clean Energy and Environmental Innovation and our Green Innovation Fund, and so much more!

And I was thrilled to sign legislation to advance the state’s nuclear energy innovation to continue our work towards ensuring Wisconsin has 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050.

Through these efforts, we’re working to lower energy bills for families, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources, and invest in jobs and apprenticeship training all while building a brighter, healthier, and more prosperous future.

And while leaders in Washington continue to slash and claw back millions of dollars of federal funding for clean energy initiatives across our state, sending us backwards, this work is more important than ever.

Now is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work, and here in Wisconsin, that’s exactly what we are going to continue to do.

So, happy National Clean Energy Week, Wisconsin, and take care.",https://drydenwire.com/site/assets/files/28127/governor-tony-evers.1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:35.613104
,Indiana and Evs,2025-09-19 16:13:07+00:00,Lethbridge News Now,Carmakers facing billions in credit purchases under EV mandate if sales don't improve,The Canadian Press,,,,,https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2025/09/19/automakers-could-be-on-the-hook-for-billions-under-ev-mandate-if-sales-dont-ramp-up/,"Kingston said it’s not clear how much money has been spent already on buying credits for the 2026 model year, which the government recently exempted from the EV sales mandate.
The federal government has ordered a 60-day review of the EV mandate.
The most recent data from Statistics Canada shows EV sales accounted for 7.7 per cent of all new vehicle sales in July.
The regulations also allow carmakers to invest in charging infrastructure to earn credits if they won’t meet their sales mandate — one credit for every $20,000 invested.
But the companies worked out these agreements years ahead of time in case sales still lagged as sales targets increased.","Kingston said it’s not clear how much money has been spent already on buying credits for the 2026 model year, which the government recently exempted from the EV sales mandate.

“I can’t tell you how much money would have already gone,” he said. “It’s committed to a multi-year contract that you could effectively option these credits as required over the coming years.”

The EV sales mandate requires that automakers ensure a certain percentage of new cars, SUVs and light-duty trucks sold are zero-emission vehicles, including plug-in hybrids.

The mandate was supposed to start at 20 per cent in 2026. Now it will begin in 2027 with an initial target of 27 per cent, rising steadily every year until 2035, when all new vehicle sales must be EVs.

The federal government has ordered a 60-day review of the EV mandate. Automakers have repeatedly called for its full repeal.

EV sales in Canada reached almost 15 per cent of total sales last year, when the government was offering consumer rebates of up to $5,000, and surpassed 18 per cent in the final three months of the year.

Sales plunged after funding for the rebate ran out in January and the government abruptly ended the program. The most recent data from Statistics Canada shows EV sales accounted for 7.7 per cent of all new vehicle sales in July.

The government paused the implementation of the mandate to help give Canada’s auto sector more liquidity in the face of U.S. tariffs.

An analysis by Anderson Economic Group suggests Canadian cars had been hit with $311 million in tariffs as of July, with another $72 million on parts made in Canada.

With 2026 models already being sold, Kingston said Tesla would be one of — if not the only — carmaker with a surplus of credits on hand to sell to other companies, since it doesn’t sell any gas-powered vehicles.

The regulations also allow carmakers to invest in charging infrastructure to earn credits if they won’t meet their sales mandate — one credit for every $20,000 invested. But the government capped that measure at 10 per cent of a company’s sales target — meaning automakers can’t buy their way out of a deficit by simply building charging stations.

Kingston said companies will almost certainly have to buy credits from other automakers like Tesla to meet their obligations.

If sales do ramp up, automakers aren’t necessarily on the hook for those credit-purchase agreements as they’re only option agreements. But the companies worked out these agreements years ahead of time in case sales still lagged as sales targets increased.

“There’s a concern that as the targets become more stringent, there’ll be fewer credits available in the marketplace,” David Adams, head of the Canadian organization representing automakers like Honda, Toyota and Hyundai, told The Canadian Press.

“So you want to make sure that you have those … credits in your back pocket in advance, so that you can utilize them when you have to.”

Like Kingston, Adams couldn’t say for sure how much money automakers have spent already on credits for the 2026 model year, noting many of the agreements are subject to nondisclosure agreements.

“You’re certainly talking millions, if not tens of millions,” Adams said.

EPA Proposes Ending Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Rules for Large, Industrial Polluters

Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin proposed a rule last week to end its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, Smart Cities Dive reports. This program requires over 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the country — mostly refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills — to report their greenhouse gas emissions every year without penalty.

The EPA is arguing that this annual reporting isn’t mandated by the Clean Air Act and that being forced to report their emissions hurts businesses and “[drives] up cost of living.” Despite the pushback, the reporting program has been an effective strategy to lower pollution levels: Since the EPA began collecting this data in 2008, these facilities have reported a 20% decrease in emissions. This move is one of many deregulation tactics by the current administration, erasing Biden- and Obama-era environmental protections.

US DOT Is Pulling Grants For Projects That Don’t Focus on Cars

Communities are seeing their federal transportation grants being taken away by the Trump administration, Streetsblog USA reports.

The grants being cut by the Department of Transportation were aimed at improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. This includes a bike trail alongside Route 66 in McLean County, Illinois; a biking and walking trail along the Naugatuck River in Connecticut; and a extending the rail trail in Albuquerque. Grantees have been instructed to instead focus on projects that promote travel by car.

These three projects were funded under the Biden administration, and local officials have been concerned for months that these grants would be revoked. In April, the department warned applicants to the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant program that infrastructure projects that reduced lane capacity for cars were less desirable.

Trump Plans To End Forest Protections for Logging and Mining

The Trump administration plans to end protections for about 45 million acres of national forest, Capital and Main reports. The government plans to allow the construction of roads, logging and mining on swaths of public land that do not have many roads.

Government officials have called the Roadless Rule, which has protected public lands from logging and road construction, too “restrictive.” Ending this protection will benefit the timber industry, but it will hurt conservation throughout the country.

Some officials have argued that this would support quicker responses to wildfires. But Capital and Main reports that a former fire chief in the Forest Service says otherwise. A study from the Wilderness Society found that forested areas that are 50 meters from roads experience almost four times more wildfire ignitions than forested areas without roads.

California Pushes to Build Denser Housing Near Transit Hubs

California’s legislature voted 21-8 last week to pass Senate Bill 79, the Abundant & Affordable Homes Near Transit Act, with Gov. Gavin Newsom to either sign or veto the bill by early October.

California will likely build denser, multifamily housing near its highest-capacity transit hubs throughout the state even if zoning laws restrict more housing, Smart Cities Dive reports. If signed, SB 79 will focus on counties in California that have at least 15 passenger rail stations. This includes San Mateo, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Santa Clara, Sacramento and Alameda.

“Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis,” State Sen. Scott Wiener said in a press release. “Decades of overly restrictive policies have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people away from jobs and transit and into long commutes.”

Public Schools Left Struggling Amid Trump Admin Funding Chaos

U.S. public school districts received emails in late June notifying that they would lose millions in federal funding, with the Trump administration freezing a $7 billion pot of promised funding, The Guardian reports. “I had teachers crying, staff members crying. They thought they were going to lose their jobs a week before school,” one Phoenix superintendent told The Guardian.

Schools struggled to keep running and to avoid staff layoffs until some of the funding was reinstated in late July after public outcry and a lawsuit that forced the administration to unfreeze funds. Still, school leaders say they can’t rely on government funding anymore: The current House budget proposal would cut federal funds for disabled students and schools serving low-income students, and Department of Education grants addressing teacher shortages and disability services have also been cut.

The Economic Engine of Capex The buildout of data centers and the power grid may offer the best opportunity to generate sustained growth.
Data Centers Require Power According to the Department of Energy, U.S. data center electricity consumption could double or triple by 2028.
The PwC study for the Data Center Coalition found that from 2017 to 2021, U.S. data centers added $2.1 trillion to GDP.
As noted by Goldman Sachs: “Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to automate many work tasks and eventually boost global economic growth.","Could data centers and the power grid be America’s next “renaissance?” With the U.S. national debt exceeding $37 trillion and interest payments surpassing defense spending, many articles have been written about the “debt doomsday” event coming. Such was a point we made in “The Debt and Deficit Problem.”

“In recent months, much debate has been about rising debt and increasing deficit levels in the U.S. For example, here is a recent headline from CNBC:”

“The article’s author suggests that U.S. federal deficits are ballooning, with spending surging due to the combined impact of tax cuts, expansive stimulus, and entitlement expenditures. Of course, with institutions like Yale, Wharton, and the CBO warning that this trend has pushed interest costs to new heights, now exceeding defense outlays, concerns about domestic solvency are rising. Even prominent figures in the media, from Larry Summers to Ray Dalio, argue that drastic action is urgently needed, otherwise another “financial crisis” is imminent.”

As we discussed in that article, the “purveyors of doom” have been saying the same thing for the last two decades, yet the American growth engine continues chugging along. Notably, Ray Dalio and Larry Summers focus on only one solution: “cutting spending,” which has horrible economic consequences.

“Furthermore, investors must understand a critical accounting concept: that the government’s debt is the household’s asset. In accounting, for every debit there is a credit that must always equal zero. In this case, when the Government issues debt (a debit), it is sent into the economy for infrastructure, defense, social welfare, etc. That money is “credited” to the bank accounts of households and corporations. Therefore, when the deficit increases, that money winds up in economic activity, and vice versa. In other words, those shouting for sharp deficit reductions are also rooting for a deep economic recession.” – The Deficit Narrative

The other challenges with cutting spending are that it is politically toxic, and tax hikes drag on growth.

However, one solution that all the mainstream “doomsayers” overlook is raising productivity and GDP through private-sector capital investment. In other words, as the U.S. did following World War II, it is possible to “grow your way out of your debt problem.”

That’s where the AI data center boom and massive electricity demand come in.

The Economic Engine of Capex

The buildout of data centers and the power grid may offer the best opportunity to generate sustained growth. The scale of investment is large enough to matter, the economic multipliers are high, and the timeline aligns with when fiscal pressure will peak.

Data centers are the backbone of the digital economy. AI models, cloud platforms, and automation rely on them, and each large AI model requires thousands of GPUs housed in purpose-built facilities. These are not minor server rooms. They are $1 billion-plus industrial complexes. But, for the build-out of “data factories” to impact economic growth, a massive investment will be required to affect a $30 trillion (nominal) U.S. economy.

How much are we talking about? As noted in our previous article on data center demand, McKinsey projects that data center investment will reach $7 trillion globally by 2030. Over 40 percent of that will happen in the U.S. Alone. Moreover, Nvidia’s latest quarterly report forecasted data center capital expenditures by Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet to reach $4 trillion by 2030, or roughly $1 trillion annually.

However, you can’t build a data center without power.

Data Centers Require Power

According to the Department of Energy, U.S. data center electricity consumption could double or triple by 2028. Deloitte expects a 30-fold increase in AI-related data center power usage by 2035, reaching 123 gigawatts. That’s more than the total residential demand in California. This means building new substations, transmission lines, and power plants. Therefore, as noted by Edison Electric Institute, investor-owned U.S. electric utilities will invest more than $1.1 trillion in the 2025-2029 period to meet that demand.

This infrastructure boom will not be optional. AI development needs low latency, which requires local capacity and reliable electricity. Since data centers are capital-intensive and mission-critical, the U.S. economy could see between $1.25 and $1.5 trillion in annual capex spending.

Why is that critical to our “debt to GDP” concerns? Large-scale capital spending is one of the few economic inputs reliably boosting long-term growth. Unlike stimulus checks or tax credits, infrastructure spending creates durable productivity improvements. We are already seeing this impact.

The PwC study for the Data Center Coalition found that from 2017 to 2021, U.S. data centers added $2.1 trillion to GDP. That’s before the AI acceleration began.

According to Reuters, in Q2 2025, AI-related capex accounted for over one-third of real GDP growth, which added roughly 0.4 percentage points to quarterly GDP.

The Multiplier Effect

But it isn’t just $1 trillion in CapEx. These projects create upstream demand for construction, power equipment, semiconductors, cooling systems, and skilled labor. They support engineering, real estate, logistics, and utility services. Most notably, they set the stage for sustained gains in productivity. Once operational, AI systems reduce costs, improve decision-making, and enable scale in industries from health care to manufacturing. In other words, there is a “multiplier effect” to these projects. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that every $1 billion in infrastructure investment creates 13,000 jobs and adds $3 billion to GDP over a decade.

Therefore, by 2030, if the $5 trillion in combined investment in AI data centers and power generation comes to fruition, the U.S. economy will see an additional $15 trillion in growth. The chart below shows the average 5-year growth rate in nominal GDP and projected growth.

The chart below assumes we will continue to issue debt at the average quarterly pace since 2021. However, instead of wasting money, we focus on productive investments while maintaining all current spending programs and obligations. Assuming some conservative growth estimates resulting from the investments, the “debt to GDP” ratio will begin declining in 2026 and revert to more sustainable levels by 2030.

However, this isn’t a guarantee, but it is certainly potentially more realistic than a “debt crisis” that sends the U.S. into an economic depression.

Risks and Constraints

The growth opportunity is significant, but not risk-free. While the bears constantly ring the alarm bell about the current level of debt and deficits, the more dire economic consequences they forecast may fail to come to fruition.

As noted by Goldman Sachs:

“Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to automate many work tasks and eventually boost global economic growth. AI will start having a measurable impact on US GDP in 2027 and begin affecting growth in other economies worldwide in the following years. The foundation of the forecast is the finding that AI could ultimately automate around 25% of labor tasks in advanced economies and 10-20% of work in emerging economies.”

They currently estimate a growth boost to GDP from AI of 0.4 percentage points in the US.

Increases in productivity, productive capital investment, and increased labor demand for the infrastructure buildout (which will also result in higher wages) should provide the economic boost needed.

Conclusion

Will it solve all of the current socio-economic ills facing the U.S.? No. However, it may provide the growth boost necessary to revitalize economic growth and prosperity in the U.S., which we have not seen since the 1970s. But there are risks to this outlook.

The scale of spending may lift electricity prices. A study from NC State found national prices could rise 8 percent by 2030, with some localities seeing 20–25 percent jumps. If not managed, this could erode industrial competitiveness.

Jobs per dollar of investment are low. Data centers are automated. Once built, they require few workers. A $1 billion facility may employ only 100 people full-time.

There is a local backlash. Projects require land, water, and energy. Communities are resisting tax incentives and environmental costs. Several counties have imposed moratoriums.

Permitting delays and regulatory hurdles remain high. The average interconnection wait for new power projects is over 3 years. Without reform, many AI investments will be delayed or redirected.

The government will need to be involved to unlock the full economic benefit.

Public policy must streamline permitting, including environmental review, grid interconnection, and land use.

Given that infrastructure and national security are at stake, a public/private partnership should be involved.

Tax policy should avoid distortion. Many subsidies go to projects that were already economically viable.

The focus should be on shared infrastructure, such as transmission lines, regional data hubs, and reliability upgrades.

Utilities need regulatory clarity. Traditional cost-of-service models may not align with the fast pace of AI demand, so performance-based rates or return-on-equity mechanisms may be required.

Energy policy must support generation diversity. Solar and wind are inefficient, and AI demands require firm natural gas, nuclear, and advanced storage capacity.

The goal should be energy abundance. High reliability, low prices, and scalable infrastructure will attract private AI investment and increase growth.

It may also just be enough to keep the demise of the U.S. from occurring any time soon.",https://realinvestmentadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Electric-Power-Grid-e1716919382866.png,N,,2025-09-19 14:05:53.650570

The plant in Estonia is offering a chance to lock in supply chains at a time of global trade tensions, including over rare earths with China.
MP Materials, the sole US rare earths miner, will have annual capacity exceeding Neo’s, with production slated to start later this year.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen passed around a magnet from Neo’s plant in the Baltic country at a Group of Seven meeting in Kananaskis, western Canada in June.
“Everyone else frankly in the industry is generally making promises about what they’ll be doing in the future,” Neo’s Suleman said.","Executives from Europe’s electric-vehicle industry are trekking to the continent’s sparsely populated northeastern parts to queue for something they struggle to find outside of China: rare-earths magnets that are essential components in EVs.

In Narva, an Estonian industrial town that sits across the river from Russia, Canadian company Neo Performance Materials has built a $75 million magnets plant that opened on Friday. Neo’s initial output will supply components for as many as 1 million cars annually.

“Rare earths are on the top of every government’s list of critical materials,” Neo Chief Executive Officer Rahim Suleman said at the ribbon-cutting, which was also attended by Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal and representatives from General Motors Co. and parts suppliers Robert Bosch GmbH, Schaeffler AG and Mahle GmbH, among others.

Bosch, the world’s biggest automotive supplier, has reserved a “significant” share of the plant’s annual magnet production, Neo said in a statement on Friday after signing a multi-year memorandum of understanding with the German firm.

The plant in Estonia is offering a chance to lock in supply chains at a time of global trade tensions, including over rare earths with China. Europe and the world’s vulnerabilities were exposed earlier this year when Beijing in April heavily restricted the export of some of its rare earths in retaliation against US President Donald Trump’s decision to hike tariffs on Chinese goods.

European Union companies incurred seven production stoppages in August because of shortages in rare earths, and an additional 46 are expected this month, the EU Chamber of Commerce in China said Thursday, without specifying the scale or nature of the affected facilities.

Neo’s Estonian plant manufactures neodymium magnets, one of the products restricted by China. The magnets convert the electricity stored in a battery into motion, helping rotate the wheels of EVs. They are also used widely from smartphones to wind turbines and fighter jets.

A shortage of rare earth magnet supplies earlier this year forced Ford Motor Co. to idle production of its Explorer sport utility vehicle in Chicago for a week.

Neo - which is also active in chemicals and metals and has 10 manufacturing plants globally, including in the United States and China - made the decision to build the new factory in Estonia in late 2022, months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine disrupted Europe’s economy. Neo managed to complete its site on time and within budget, Suleman said.

“With the exception of Neo there is no EV traction motor magnet manufacturing capacity in the West,” Marvin Wolff, an analyst at Paradigm Capital, said in an Aug. 12 report.

The plant will initially produce 2,000 tons of magnets per year, about a tenth of the demand in Europe. The factory will source its own raw materials from Australia.

Neo has signed “multiple” five- to seven-year contracts in the range of $50-$100 million, Suleman said, adding that major deliveries are set to begin in 2026.

“This is the most important critical materials project happening in Europe today,” Suleman said in an interview ahead of the factory opening.

Neo plans to triple capacity there after an expansion that could begin in 2027. It would cater to soaring demand fueled by European carmakers, who are pivoting toward EVs ahead of a 2035 deadline to ban the sale of new vehicles with combustion engines.

While there are signs that the EU directive may be watered down - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz last week backed a bid by his country’s carmakers to soften the rules - the direction of travel toward more EVs isn’t in doubt.

BMW AG, Volkswagen AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG all showed off new EV models at the Munich auto show last week that they said would put them in a position to take on intensifying competition from China.

The magnets trade is expected to be among the thorniest items for negotiation when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at the end of October on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea.

While China has recently eased its rare-earths controls - exports rose to a highest monthly level in August since at least 2012, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Chinese customs data - Beijing’s earlier weaponization of its market dominance has spurred Western companies to look for alternative suppliers.

Last month, GM signed a deal with Texas-based Noveon Magnetics Inc. to secure rare-earth magnets for its full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. Along with contracts with Las Vegas-based MP Materials Corp. and E-Vac Magnetics, a South Carolina-based unit of Germany’s Vacuumschmelze GmbH, GM plans to get the majority of rare-earth magnets it sources directly from domestic suppliers.

MP Materials, the sole US rare earths miner, will have annual capacity exceeding Neo’s, with production slated to start later this year. The company will also serve customers including Apple Inc. and has plans to add a Pentagon-funded factory to expand production.

Neo though is first out of the gate - much to the delight of Canada and the EU.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen passed around a magnet from Neo’s plant in the Baltic country at a Group of Seven meeting in Kananaskis, western Canada in June. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney brandished a sample during a speech, hailing his nation as one with “immense potential” as a rare-earths supplier.

“Everyone else frankly in the industry is generally making promises about what they’ll be doing in the future,” Neo’s Suleman said. “We built it in under 500 days.”

“Energy prices continue to skyrocket as Trump blocks clean energy investment, and these bills will only ensure that rates continue to climb.”","The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Thursday that could give dispatchable power plants priority in interconnection queues.

“The interconnection queue is overwhelmed and bogged down, leaving shovel-ready power projects waiting for years while demand continues to climb,” Rep. Troy Balderson, R-Ohio and the bill’s sponsor, said in a press release.

Under the GRID Power Act, FERC would have 60 days to review proposals from regional transmission organizations and independent system operators for specific projects that would be pushed to the head of interconnection queues.

The RTOs and ISOs would have to show the proposed projects would bolster grid reliability and resilience, according to the legislation. The bill defines dispatchable power as “an electric energy generation resource capable of providing known and forecastable electric supply in time intervals necessary to ensure grid reliability.”

The bill requires FERC to start a rulemaking process to implement the legislation within 90 days after the bill becomes law and to complete the rulemaking within 180 days.

Sens. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Todd Young, R-Ind., have introduced a companion bill in the Senate.

The Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group for power producers, supports the bill.

“It has been surprising to hear that opponents of the GRID [Power] Act believe that this process will become chronic or habit-forming for grid operators or somehow represents a permanent barrier or level of discrimination against non-dispatchable projects,” EPSA President and CEO Todd Snitcher said in a “backgrounder” on the bill. “If the immediate reliability need doesn’t exist or can’t be explained, and FERC isn’t convinced both to the urgency and efficiency of the proposal, then queue prioritization doesn’t take place.”

The Sierra Club said the bill — along with two other energy bills that passed the House Thursday — would hamper efforts to build cleaner, more reliable energy sources, like wind and solar, that can be built more quickly than fossil-fueled power plants.

“House Republicans have continued the claim they want abundant, affordable, American-sourced energy while doing everything in their power to block clean energy progress and prop up dirty, expensive energy sources of the past,” Beyond Fossil Fuels Policy Director Mahyar Sorour said in a statement. “Energy prices continue to skyrocket as Trump blocks clean energy investment, and these bills will only ensure that rates continue to climb.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/pM37JHXejhCdo9pPo3j6rKtzv2-JpPZcX87dXtWoR4E/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ESklfMDIwOC1jcm9wLWUxNTg5OTA3NTc2NTI4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-19 12:05:47.743887

The EIA expects gas prices to rise to $4/MMBtu this year from $2.20/MMBtu last year.

Average residential electricity rates jumped 6.6% over last year as of June, with the largest increases in Maine, up 25.5%, the District of Columbia, up 23.3%, and New Jersey, up 21%, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

All sectors saw an increase in price, as measured in revenues per kWh, with a total average increase of 5.2% over last June to 13.88 cents/kWh. But the rise was not evenly distributed. Residential customers saw the highest increase, followed by transportation, up 6.1%; the industrial sector, up 5.1%; and the commercial sector, up 4.8%.

Also, natural gas prices at the Henry Hub soared 22.6% to $3.11 per million British thermal units in June from June 2024, the EIA said in its most recent Electricity Monthly Update. Gas prices help set wholesale power prices, which affect electricity bills over time.

Dive Insight:

Differences in how utilities report costs mean it’s hard to say exactly which pressures have made the greatest contributions to rising electric prices, said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, senior director of domestic climate policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization. CAP did its own analysis based on utility rate filings that found U.S. residential electricity rates rose 7% between June 2024 and June 2025.

But to date, rising natural gas prices paired with growing demand seem to account for the bulk of requested utility rate increases, Baker-Branstetter said. The EIA expects gas prices to rise to $4/MMBtu this year from $2.20/MMBtu last year.

Some of the growing demand is from artificial intelligence data centers that have stressed utilities’ budgets as operators push for more infrastructure projects on top of grid upgrades that were probably already overdue, Baker-Branstetter said. Extreme weather has also increased utilities’ costs. But the full impact of tariffs and the loss of clean energy tax credits has yet to show up in electrical rates, they said.

“We are definitely seeing, at a most basic level, an increase in demand and constraints in supply,” Baker-Branstetter said.

At least 102 gas and electric utilities have either raised or proposed higher rates that would go into effect in 2025 or 2026, according to CAP. These rate cases could raise Americans’ total electric bills by some $67 billion.

CAP’s conclusions echo those of a different report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. That also said natural gas and a loss of federal support for renewable energy would drive up prices.

Rising rates have already triggered a public backlash that is raising the pressure on elected representatives and regulators.

Indiana’s governor recently pressed for lower utility rates from investor-owned utilities, saying “We can’t take it anymore.”

The Arizona attorney general has also opposed a proposed rate hike in that state and said regulators should consider lowering rates instead.

Electricity prices have also popped up as a political issue in New Hampshire, New Jersey and throughout much of the PJM Interconnection.

Concerns about affordability could lead to greater scrutiny of utility requests in the future, Baker-Branstetter said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dYEG87f2O5sRYVeNjuO-TAufKGCXA0K9ZtFo_1PTMAg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DZWRhcl9DcmVla19HYXNfUGxhbnQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-19 12:08:16.791855

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman David Rosner laid out his priorities during his first open meeting on Thursday as head of the agency, including a desire to issue guidance soon on how data centers can be colocated with power plants in the PJM Interconnection.

“My priorities as chairman are the same as when I was a commissioner,” Rosner said. “I’m working hard with my colleagues to make decisions swiftly, fairly and independently. Grid reliability as job number one has not changed.”

Rosner, a Democrat, replaced Mark Christie, a Republican, as FERC chairman after Christie left the agency in early August. Rosner joined FERC in June 2024. With Republicans Laura Swett and David LaCerte advancing through the Senate confirmation process to fill the agency’s two empty seats, it’s unclear how long Rosner will remain chairman.

In discussing his priorities, Rosner said he is focused on enabling economic growth through “abundant and affordable energy.”

He said he is “really excited” about infrastructure.

“I think we need to build, build, build,” Rosner said. “America needs every electron and every molecule of every type we can get, and we need more infrastructure to move it … Reliable and affordable energy, it’s not only a prerequisite to ensuring the safety and security of the American people, but it’s also totally critical to winning the AI race, reshoring manufacturing and ensuring a prosperous economy.”

FERC is focused on developing “accurate, clear, stable market price signals to get new infrastructure built in places where it’s needed,” Rosner said. That means connecting new generation to the grid faster, and fair and fast decisions on issues related to pipelines, hydropower, liquefied natural gas and transmission lines, he said.

Tackling the PJM colocation review

Resolving the pending PJM colocation docket is a top priority, according to Rosner. Under colocation arrangements data centers receive electricity directly from a nearby power plant.

“It’s also a very complicated topic,” Rosner said. “My colleagues and I have been working hard on this. I’m really excited about colocation and everything in between, and getting the rules of the road in place so that we can unlock all these new technologies, get them on the grid and get data centers built.”

FERC Commissioner Lindsay See echoed Rosner’s comments on the colocation proceeding.

“My office has been deeply engaged on these matters, and I look forward to being able to bring it to a close,” See said.

In an interview, Christie lamented his inability to issue a colocation decision before he left the agency on Aug. 8.

“I pushed very hard for a set of guidelines — which is what all the regulated entities were asking — that would protect consumers from cost shifting and protect reliability, and I couldn’t get two other votes,” Christie said Thursday.

The outcome of the review could set a precedent for colocated load in the power markets FERC oversees.

Speedy decisions vs. regulatory certainty

During FERC’s open meeting, See said part of her goal at FERC is to get the “tension right” between making decisions quickly and regulatory certainty.

“I never want us to be the holdup when it comes to necessary development of infrastructure and permitting decisions,” See said. “We play a critical role in doing needed policy in a fair, predictable and legally durable way.”

See noted that while attending Gastech, an annual trade show, in Milan earlier this month, she spoke to leaders in the gas industry “who said that as much as they value speed in what we do — and trust me, they do — they also want strong confidence that the orders we issue are worth their weight, and they will stand up when they’re tested in court.”

See said she hopes in the near future FERC will launch a process to create a “blanket certificate” program for LNG export facilities modeled after one FERC has for gas pipelines and other facilities. A blanket certificate allows a gas company to undertake certain routine activities on their facilities without obtaining specific permission from FERC for each individual project.

The United States has become the largest LNG exporter in the world, with exports totaling 11.9 billion cubic feet per day last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The U.S. has eight LNG export terminals that can handle 14.5 Bcf/d and another eight are being built that could export about 21.8 Bcf/d, according to FERC.

Working with businesses, nonprofits or local governments, each fellow contributed to projects that both supported local organizations and advanced their own professional goals.

Administered by IU’s Environmental Resilience Institute , McKinney Climate Fellows connects undergraduate and graduate students to full-time, paid summer positions to work on climate, energy and community resilience projects. IU students are encouraged to apply for the summer 2026 cohort now through Nov. 1.

Growing sustainability knowledge at Newfields

For Caroline Pennington, a Kelley School of Business student, becoming a McKinney Climate Fellow was a chance to align her interest in economic consulting with her commitment to sustainability. At Newfields — the 152-acre campus that includes the Indianapolis Museum of Art — Pennington spent her summer conducting a waste audit and working with staff to improve recycling and composting efforts.

“When applying for internships and professional development experiences, I knew that I wanted something more out of the ordinary for business students, but something that still meant a lot to me,” she said. “When one of my professors told me about McKinney Climate Fellows, I jumped at the chance to apply.”

In addition to the waste audit, Pennington worked with Newfields’ natural resources department to remove invasive plant species and plant more native species throughout the grounds. Each day, she relished walking the grounds, with forested paths, gardens and fountains.

“It’s just a beautiful place to be,” she said.

Supporting rural resilience through community engagement

IU Southeast junior Owen Harmon said the McKinney Climate Fellows opened his eyes to the role students can play in supporting rural communities.

As a member of the Environmental Resilience Institute’s Indiana Resilience Funding Hub, Harmon researched funding opportunities for rural community projects, collaborated with local leaders and visited rural libraries to discuss solar projects.

“I believe that the most important thing I learned from my internship is that change starts on such a small scale, and that just one person or a small group can do so much to bring about positive change,” he said.

Harmon, who is majoring in geoscience with a minor in sustainability, said the program gave him his first taste of working in a professional environment and the confidence to pursue future career paths.

“It taught me that it’s not so scary working with professionals in the field, and that at the end of the day we’re all the same, just people,” he said.

Cutting food waste, boosting energy efficiency

At Second Helpings, an Indianapolis nonprofit that turns surplus food into thousands of meals each year, IU Bloomington student Sophie DeWael showcased a mix of technical and operational skills.

DeWael, who is studying environmental and sustainability studies with a concentration in sustainable food systems, created an online dashboard to track the organization’s environmental impact, helped secure a $10,000 sustainability grant and jumped into daily operations — from food rescue to kitchen prep.

“She fit right in with the culture here and really got to work,” said Nora Spitznogle, Second Helpings’ chief program officer.

DeWael’s dashboard now helps the nonprofit measure emissions reductions, track waste diversion and set future sustainability goals. The experience reaffirmed her interest in sustainable food systems and showed her the power of local action.

North Carolina is among the leading states in electric vehicle batteries and manufacturing, as the industry booms in the Southeast. Companies have announced over $20 billion in EV and battery manufacturing projects in North Carolina, including over 16,000 new jobs.

“Investments in EVs and batteries, particularly in Georgia and North Carolina, were the largest economic development projects ever in the history of those states,” said Stan Cross, electric transportation director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which studied EV adoption.

The bulk of that investment in North Carolina comes from the $14 billion Toyota battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, N.C. The Charlotte region has seen similar investments, including those from direct current charger manufacturer Alpitronic and commercial vehicle manufacturer Daimler.

“Of the top four states that have investments in manufacturing EVs and batteries and such, three of them are in the Southeast: Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.

Michigan was number one. EV and battery manufacturing and sales in the Southeast have grown rapidly despite less public funding. The Southeast has received slightly more than half the national average.

But storm clouds are gathering: Private investments are slowing down, and some companies have canceled projects altogether. California-based battery manufacturer Natron Energy abandoned plans to build a $1.4 billion battery manufacturing plant in Kingsboro, N.C., news outlets reported. The project promised to create 1,000 jobs in Edgecombe County. The state was prepared to reimburse costs up to 21.7 million dollars, but the company failed to raise sufficient capital to complete the project. The site would have been the country’s first sodium-ion battery gigafactory.

Nigro said it’s too soon to tell if these market contractions were caused by federal policy shifts.

“If I had to put my money on it, a lot of these cancellations that we’ve seen this year — whether we’re talking about electric vehicles or batteries — were just going to happen anyway,” Nigro said.

Although the Southeast lags the rest of the country, EV sales in N.C. have steadily grown since 2020. The same can be said for S.C., albeit at a much slower rate. It remains to be seen if Trump’s repeal of the clean energy tax credits will cause EV sales to plateau or decrease in market share.

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated nearly $5 billion to expand EV charging infrastructure through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, or NEVI.. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated nearly $5 billion to expand EV charging infrastructure. The North Carolina Department of Transportation anticipated receiving $109 million; however, the Trump administration paused the program in February and has not issued new guidance for states since.

“The entire globe is moving to electrification, and if the U.S. is going to have an auto industry in the future, we have to have a really robust electric vehicle manufacturing base,” Nigro said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ee3891/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2034x1068+0+44/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fe0%2Fbef3f84546a684a8e511b7e37602%2F072721-ev-home-charging.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 12:05:17.337286

In May, Reeves went further, noting during his Power Play Summit that “the future is going to be nuclear,” a sign of state-level support for nuclear power development in some capacity.
State officials have said Mississippi is open to expanding its current nuclear power generation, which currently sits at one facility, Entergy’s Grand Gulf Nuclear Station near Port Gibson.
The USEIA reports that the 1,400-megawatt Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station is the largest single-reactor nuclear power plant by net summer generating capacity in the nation.
Mississippi’s willingness to further explore nuclear power and its proactive attitude are positive signs for the state, the CEO said.","“Economic development in the future is going to go to places where you have affordable and reliable power,” PSC Commissioner De’Keither Stamps said.

With billions of dollars in economic development projects coming to Mississippi, including multiple data centers, reliable and affordable energy is needed to power these new facilities as they require substantial amounts of electricity.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA), natural gas accounted for 76 percent of Mississippi’s electricity net generation in 2023 and was the primary fuel used at nine of the state’s ten largest power plants.

However, to meet the demands of the future, one energy source state officials are exploring is nuclear power.

Governor Tate Reeves (R) has shown an openness to support nuclear power during his announcements of these large-scale projects, saying he supports all energy sources if they are safe, reliable, and affordable.

In May, Reeves went further, noting during his Power Play Summit that “the future is going to be nuclear,” a sign of state-level support for nuclear power development in some capacity.

Last year, the Mississippi Public Service Commission also threw its support behind nuclear power. The three-member commission passed a resolution stating the PCS recognizes nuclear power as “a clean baseload energy necessary to achieve a reliable, secure, and diversified electric grid.”

Chris Brown (R), the Northern District PSC Commissioner and the group’s chairman, said three major benefits of nuclear power are resiliency, reliability, and affordability. The PSC oversees a wide range of public utility regulation, including power generation.

State officials have said Mississippi is open to expanding its current nuclear power generation, which currently sits at one facility, Entergy’s Grand Gulf Nuclear Station near Port Gibson.

The USEIA reports that the 1,400-megawatt Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station is the largest single-reactor nuclear power plant by net summer generating capacity in the nation. The plant generated about 16 percent of the state’s electricity in 2023.

Commissioner Brown believes being open to more nuclear power generation shows the world “Mississippi is open for business.” In November, Brown went further, telling the Senate Energy Committee, “We think nuclear is our future.”

Last fall, at an PSC-sponsored Nuclear Summit, Central District Commissioner De’Keither Stamps (D) said nuclear energy is linked to Mississippi’s economic development.

“Economic development in the future is going to go to places where you have affordable and reliable power,” Stamps said. “And one of the most affordable and reliable power sources is nuclear.”

With Mississippi already having three data centers under construction, AWS, AVAIO and Compass, Brown said nuclear power will make the Magnolia State more attractive to similar industries.

“Securing the power connection is typically the biggest hurdle for a data center,” an AVAIO spokesperson said.

Data centers and the rise of AI-powered tools have created unprecedented demand for computing power, wrote Robert Rapier in Forbes earlier this year.

“These complex models require massive amounts of electricity not just during training, but continuously during deployment (or inference) as well,” Rapier wrote. “This isn’t just about a few extra servers. AI data centers are power-hungry operations, often requiring the energy equivalent of a small city. Some estimates suggest that U.S. data centers could consume more electricity by 2030 than entire countries such as Japan or Turkey.”

Rapier notes that electric utilities from Texas to Virginia are scrambling to adapt to this new energy strain on the grid.

“The challenges are both technical and political. Meeting these new demands often requires massive upgrades to transmission infrastructure—projects that can take five to ten years to permit and build. Meanwhile, delays frustrate developers and risk driving AI firms to seek power from independent suppliers or alternative locations,” Rapier wrote. “Utility companies are being forced to rethink everything: where and how they build generation, how they plan grid expansions, and how to regulate and forecast demand. The traditional demand modeling tools that rely on historical trends are no longer sufficient in this brave new world.”

There has been speculation about another nuclear facility in Mississippi to help with energy generation in this new tech environment, particularly in Tishomingo County’s Yellow Creek. For half a decade, Huntsville, Alabama-based Flibe Energy has spent more than $250 million on site improvements. Yet, it remains unclear when and if the site would receive approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Flibe’s Chief Executive Officer Kirk Sorensen was in attendance at the state’s Power Play Summit. Mississippi’s willingness to further explore nuclear power and its proactive attitude are positive signs for the state, the CEO said.

“This aligns perfectly with our vision for Mississippi’s energy landscape, where our Yellow Creek operations could play a critical role in regional energy security,” Sorenson said.

In 1978, the Tennessee Valley Authority started construction on the Yellow Creek nuclear power plant but abandoned its work in 1983. The TVA abandoned the project in 1984 due to cost and lower electrical demands, according to the New York Times.

Sorenson emphasized to Governor Reeves how rising uranium costs – a vital material in nuclear reactors – threaten conventional nuclear economics, while Flibe’s thorium-based Lithium Fluoride Thorium Reactor technology offers a promising alternative with significantly lower fuel and construction expenses.

“Flibe Energy remains committed to working alongside Mississippi stakeholders to advance thorium energy as a safe, affordable, and sustainable power solution for the region,” Sorenson said.

President Donald Trump (R) called for 10 nuclear power facilities to be built by 2030 in a recent executive order, with accelerated licensing timelines, construction of reactors for the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Defense use, and support for nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure.

Mississippi officials are not sure if the state will see a nuclear power plant approved by way of the executive orders, but they are hopeful.

But without steel, the foundation of every solar project, ambition alone will not be enough.","The American steel market has rarely looked this tight. Domestic mills are booked through the end of 2025, and customers across industries are scrambling to secure material. For builders, automakers, and renewable energy developers, the supply pipeline is simply clogged.

What could have been dismissed as a normal cycle has been hardened into something far more serious. Trade policies have compounded the shortage. The 25 percent Section 232 tariff has been in place since 2018, but in June 2025, the U.S. doubled the duty to 50 percent, Council on Foreign Relations, April 2025. For India, which shipped nearly half a billion dollars of iron and steel to the U.S. last year, the move was crippling. These duties may have been meant to shield domestic producers from oversupply abroad, but the timing could not be worse for downstream industries that depend on steady inputs to keep projects moving.

India’s role

India is not America’s largest steel supplier; Canada, Brazil, and South Korea dominate in tonnage. Yet India fills a strategic niche, exporting specialized flat-rolled and structural products that are difficult to substitute. These grades flow directly into infrastructure and renewable energy projects.

In 2024, U.S. imports from India totaled roughly 487 million dollars. That number looks modest against the nation’s overall steel trade, but the concentration matters. Much of it ends up in solar farms, racking systems, and modular structures. Developers favored Indian material not only because it was cost-competitive, but also because it reliably met the standards of strength and galvanization. The new tariffs cut off that option overnight.

Solar in the crosshairs

Few industries feel the squeeze as sharply as solar. Steel is not just an input; it is the skeleton of every project. Mounting structures, racking, and single-axis trackers are all steel-intensive. Their performance—resistance to wind loads, corrosion protection, and structural integrity over 25 years—depends on reliable material.

These systems account for 10% to 15% of a project’s total cost.. Tariffs that push up prices by half have an immediate and painful effect on project economics. Developers who set budgets in 2024 are finding those numbers obsolete. Worse, the problem is not only about price, but also about availability. Mills are oversold, and even buyers who are prepared to pay more often cannot get the tonnage they need. That reality is already rippling into project schedules, said a report from Reuters. Developers are stretching timelines, postponing installations into 2026, and revising financial models to account for higher capital expenditure. Every delay slows the renewable energy buildout that federal and state policies are trying to accelerate.

A double squeeze

The tariff shock is only half the story. At the same time, U.S. solar manufacturers have asked the Department of Commerce to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar cells and modules imported from India, said Reuters. Their claim is that Indian producers are subsidized and are pricing below cost. If those duties are enacted, it will raise module prices just as mounting structures are already becoming more expensive.

That creates a double squeeze. On one side, the steel that holds solar projects together is harder to get and more costly. On the other hand, the panels that generate electricity may soon face their own barriers. Margins erode. Installations stall. The U.S. loses ground in global competitiveness as other countries press ahead with lower-cost renewable energy deployments.

What executives should do

For senior leaders, this is not a problem to watch passively. It demands action. Several strategic responses stand out.

Manage price risk proactively:

Steel prices are already climbing, and they will climb further. Companies must consider hedging, locking in long-term fixed contracts, or building pricing flexibility into customer agreements. Waiting to see where the market settles is a gamble few can afford.

Prepare for project delays.:

Supply constraints are real. Executives should not assume that paying more will solve the problem. Instead, project teams need to evaluate phased or staggered execution and communicate realistic timelines to regulators, investors, and customers. Transparency now will preserve trust later.

Reinforce investor confidence:

Trade volatility has made financing more complicated. Lenders want predictability, but right now, uncertainty dominates. Developers who can demonstrate diversified sourcing strategies, strong supplier relationships, or alternative procurement pathways will be better positioned to secure capital.

Consider vertical integration or partnerships:

Some firms are exploring joint ventures with domestic steelmakers to secure priority access. Others are weighing in-house fabrication for racking and trackers. Neither option is inexpensive, but both reduce exposure to tariff risk and improve supply reliability.

Policy questions

The shortage also exposes a policy dilemma. On the one hand, tariffs protect domestic producers and manufacturing jobs. On the other hand, they slow renewable deployment at a time when the Inflation Reduction Act and state mandates are pushing the U.S. to build clean power at unprecedented speed.

Targeted exemptions for renewable infrastructure may be the most pragmatic answer. Section 232 has been flexed this way before when supply shortages threatened national interest. A carve-out for solar would not eliminate the challenges, but would alleviate the most severe bottlenecks.

Another path is to encourage domestic capacity dedicated to renewable-grade steel. Incentives for galvanizing lines, structural production, or lightweight flat-rolled materials could build resilience over time. But new capacity takes years and billions of dollars. It will not help developers already facing delays.

The global dimension

This is not just an American problem. Steel markets are tight everywhere. Europe and Southeast Asia are also competing for supply to support their own infrastructure programs and energy transitions. Diverting imports from one region to another is not realistic.

India, for its part, has begun imposing safeguard duties on certain imports to shield its producers, Economic Times, August 2025. That signals a more protectionist posture globally. U.S. buyers should not assume they can simply pivot to other suppliers without encountering similar headwinds.

A pivotal moment

The U.S. now faces a crossroads. Trade protection has long been framed as a way to bolster industrial strength. However, the energy transition relies on affordable and timely steel, and these two goals are in conflict. Business leaders are caught in the middle.

This is the moment for clarity. Executives must diversify their supply, rethink procurement strategies, and, in some cases, invest directly in capacity. Policymakers must weigh the costs of protectionism against the urgency of climate goals. If both groups continue along parallel paths without coordination, the result will be predictable: slower renewable deployment, higher costs, and lost ground in the global race for clean energy.

The Japanese electronics company aims to boost battery capacity by 25%, potentially extending Tesla’s Model Y range by around 90 miles (145 km) with the existing battery size.

Panasonic’s new battery could also enable the company to create “lighter” and potentially more affordable batteries by maintaining the current driving range while reducing battery size, according to the news agency’s report.

Ahead of a presentation by Panasonic Energy’s technology leader Shoichiro Watanabe, a company executive revealed details about anode-free battery technology.

This method involves generating a lithium metal anode inside the battery after its first charge, allowing for the inclusion of more active cathode materials like cobalt, aluminium, and nickel, thereby increasing capacity without expanding the battery’s size.

These two energy giants — with their respective California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grids — are rapidly expanding their clean power portfolios, widening the gap over other states.

This dynamic reshapes the American energy landscape, highlighting the growing regional divergence in clean energy growth and future capacity. This comprehensive article explores the statistics, drivers, policy frameworks, and implications of this clean energy surge in California and Texas.

Overview of Clean Power Growth in 2025

By August 2025, combined clean electricity output from California’s CAISO and Texas’s ERCOT marked record levels, expanding 10% from the same period in 2024. This rate significantly outpaced the rest of the U.S., which saw only a 2.6% increase in clean energy generation. The combined output from both grids reached more than 10.2 million megawatt-hours (MWh), reflecting both continued capacity additions and heightened efficiency in renewable resource integration.

Role of California ISO (CAISO) and Texas ERCOT

CAISO: Manages approximately 80% of California’s electric load, coordinating generation, transmission, and consumption across a power grid increasingly reliant on renewables and battery storage.

ERCOT: Oversees about 90% of Texas’s electric demand, supporting a grid powered primarily by wind and solar farms alongside natural gas plants, enabling significant clean energy deployment.

Both operators maintain intricate systems balancing intermittent solar and wind generation with grid reliability.

Record-Breaking Clean Electricity Generation Statistics

Key Drivers of Growth in California

California’s clean energy surge is led by:

Aggressive solar PV installations, with rooftop and utility-scale projects

Expanding battery storage that enhances grid flexibility and stores midday solar for evening use

Regulatory targets requiring 100% clean electricity by 2045, including Senate Bill 100

Electrification of transportation and buildings increasing electricity demand compensated by renewables

Sustainable investments driven by Climate Investments and Cap-and-Trade revenues

Solar Power Capacity in California and Texas

California maintains its position as the nation’s solar leader but Texas is rapidly closing the gap due to vast land, favorable policies, and strong wind resources.

Wind and Battery Storage Growth in Both States

Wind remains dominant in Texas with multiple large-scale farms, while California leans on solar and fast-growing battery installations:

California has surpassed 13,000 MW of battery storage capacity distributed across residential, commercial, and utility scale.

Texas has installed over 9,000 MW of battery storage, focusing on grid support during peak demand or generation gaps.

Both states integrate renewable generation with storage to maintain grid reliability despite variable weather patterns.

Policy Frameworks Driving Expansion

Essential elements include:

California’s Senate Bill 100, mandating clean energy reach, and initiatives like the Strategic Reliability Reserve.

Texas’s competitive market incentives and Renewable Portfolio Goal policies encouraging private investment.

Federal Inflation Reduction Act grants stimulating new renewable and storage developments.

Both states have unique regulatory environments—California with more centralized management (CAISO) and Texas featuring a decentralized market (ERCOT)—but both succeed in rapid capacity expansion.

Comparison of Clean Energy Share: CAISO & ERCOT vs. Rest of U.S.

In 2025, clean energy sources comprised nearly 74% of CAISO’s power mix and 46.5% of ERCOT’s. These figures contrast with the 39% share recorded across the rest of the country, highlighting significant regional disparities.

Table: Clean Power Generation by Region, 2025 (Jan–Aug)

Federal Funding and Its Impact on Investments

Federal incentives and grants catalyzed much of the 2025 investment surge. However, expected declines in federal funding for renewables may challenge other states lacking robust infrastructure and policy frameworks, potentially widening the gap with California and Texas.

Challenges and Capacity Constraints

Despite growth, challenges remain:

Grid integration complexities, especially with variable renewable generation

Transmission constraints limiting delivery from resource-rich regions to demand centers

Occasional curtailments occur due to oversupply or grid operational limits, especially in Texas

Need for upgraded grid capabilities and cross-state coordination to fully harness renewables

Impacts on Electricity Markets and Prices

The boom in clean energy has steepened competition, leading to:

Reduced wholesale power prices during peak renewable generation

Greater price volatility when renewable output dips or demand spikes

Increased reliance on flexible demand response and storage solutions

Environmental and Economic Benefits

Reduction in carbon emissions—California’s 2025 emissions in the power sector dropped by over 20% compared to 2015 levels.

Job creation in construction, manufacturing, and maintenance of solar and storage facilities.

Enhanced public health from reduced air pollution.

Future Outlook: Continuous Growth and Grid Evolution

Industry forecasts predict continued expansion of battery storage, solar, and wind with emerging technologies such as green hydrogen and advanced grid management playing increasing roles.

Both CAISO and ERCOT plan to deploy cutting-edge forecasting and demand management tools to maintain grid stability amid rising electrification.

Technological Advancements Supporting Clean Power

Advanced battery chemistries extending storage duration

Virtual power plants aggregating distributed resources

AI and machine learning for predictive grid modeling

Enhanced power electronics accelerators for renewables integration

Conclusion

California and Texas are accelerating their leadership in clean electricity generation, propelled by strong policies, market innovation, and expanding renewable portfolios. Their widening lead over the rest of the U.S. highlights the importance of continued investment in clean energy infrastructure, regulatory commitment, and technological innovation.

(AP) — In the soft dirt of an indoor horseback riding ring last month, a group of farmers got ready to test drive a new piece of equipment: an electric tractor.

As they took turns climbing in — some surprised by its quick acceleration — they gave real-time feedback to the Michigan State University researchers who have been developing it for over two years.

The farmers remarked on the motor’s quiet whir. Most were intrigued, or at least open to the idea. Some were concerned that the battery on the underside of the carriage would mean a lower clearance over the field, while others worried that it would simply be too expensive.

“What we hope to do when we retire is we want to get everything electric on the farm. The tractor is the last electric implement to get,” said Don Dunklee, one of the farmers to provide feedback. He runs a small organic vegetable farm that’s relied on wind and solar for decades.

The market is fairly new, but some researchers and entrepreneurs think electric tractors will be ideal for small farmers who care about sustainability and want to market their products that way. The small cherry-red, open-cab machine is well-suited for tasks like weeding fields of specialty crops like carrots or asparagus, or squeezing between the tight rows of orchard trees. Farmers with solar panels can avoid the cost of diesel.

Agriculture is among the largest sources of climate-warming emissions worldwide. Though tractors are a small culprit, experts believe an environmentally friendly machine would still attract buyers interested in sustainability.

“There’s reduced emissions, but before you get there, you have to be solving for other problems,” including noise, ease of use and cost, said Derek Muller, business manager for battery electric systems at John Deere.

There are downsides — electric tractors are aimed at filling a niche, not overturning the status quo. And while battery technology has come a long way, they can’t last all day or match the massive horsepower of a diesel engine that sets giant tractors cruising through the sprawling grain and soybean operations of the Midwest.

Why few companies offer electric tractor options, and who wants them

In addition to battery limitations, there are other structural obstacles. Most farmers do not have fast electric chargers, nor do they have solar panels to supply those chargers with free electricity — diesel would need to be much more expensive for the economics to turn sharply in favor of electric. But companies are starting to see an opportunity.

“For John Deere, it is not the only solution,” Muller said. “It’s not going to be where we lead our efforts. It’s going to be one of many options.”

The company has built a small utility electric tractor prototype. It joins a limited set of offerings from other companies like Monarch Tractor, which started in 2019 with the aim to help farmers, who have traditionally struggled with razor-thin profits, save money, work sustainably and more efficiently.

Ajit Srivastava, an agricultural engineer and Michigan State professor who hosted the farmer feedback session, wants to help smallholder farmers across the world. Such farmers grow about a third of the world’s food but many do it with only hand tools. He started trying to emulate a pair of oxen made of off-the-shelf parts, so anyone could build it themselves.

“If we were to mechanize all the smallholder farmers in the world, there isn’t enough diesel out there to power them. So we have to find some other source,” Srivastava said.

It’s still a work in progress. Rain had postponed the feedback session, originally planned for the spring, because the tractor hadn’t been waterproofed yet. It also doesn’t have enough power for some jobs like tilling. But farmers generally like what Srivastava had developed. He hopes it could eventually be sold for roughly $30,000, substantially cheaper than some of the competition.

“The steering is really responsive. It just seems to run really smooth,” said Dunklee, adding, however, that it might not do everything he needs on a farm yet. “Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.”

Muller said they’re seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive. And there’s also a market at universities in other countries where researchers are studying agriculture, said Brendan Dowdle, chief business officer of Bonsai Robotics, which sells modular, automated electric farm robots that can work together to mimic some tasks ordinarily done by a tractor.

One possible customer is the so-called “gentleman farmer” who has a small operation of specialty crops or vegetables and farms for fun, not necessarily to make a living.

“They want to be self-sustaining,” said Patrick Woolcock, an associate engineering professor and agriculture expert at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

Plus, without harmful diesel emissions, they can work in greenhouses and, with fewer parts, there’s hope repairs won’t be as complicated, at least once a readily available supply is established.

Could electric tractors be more compatible with automation?

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost. Engineers are now designing machines that will drive themselves and power precise weeders and planters.

For example, Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa noted that if a self-guided tractor gets stuck and has to notify the farmer, electric power has clear benefits. A diesel tractor would sit there idling, but an electric one doesn’t waste fuel while waiting.

Srivastava also said he’s just trying to make people’s lives easier — looking backward all day to make sure a plow is operating properly is grueling. So, a self-driving tractor would let farmers pay more attention to ensuring harvesting is happening properly, or the weeder isn’t accidentally digging up crops.

“Not that we want to take the operator off the tractor, the operator would be there, but they can focus on how well the operation is going rather than making sure the tractor is in the rows,” he said.

Still, some aren’t so sure electric has such a big advantage when it comes to automation. Tim Bucher, CEO of Agtonomy, a company focused on bringing autonomy software to farm vehicles, was all-in on electric a few years ago. But the technology has gotten so good that now his customers can pick and choose the energy source for their tractor and see similar results, he said. And with government electric vehicle subsidies disappearing, there’s less incentive for most farmers to go that route.

On his own farm, though, he opts for electric, and he says he’s seen economic returns.

And from an environmental perspective, “it also just makes me feel better,” he said.

The Subcommittee on Environment of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee held a September 16th hearing titled:

From Gridlock to Growth: Permitting Reform Under the Clean Air Act (“Hearing”).

The stated purpose of the Hearing was to focus on:

…potential reforms to permitting and environmental reviews under the Clean Air Act.

The following bills will be addressed:

H.R. 161, New Source Review Permitting Improvement Act (Rep. Griffith)

Amends the definition of “modification” in multiple sections to clarify that certain activities that do not increase emissions do not trigger NSR permitting.

H.R. ___, Air Permitting Improvements to Protect National Security Act

Amends Section 173 to exempt advanced manufacturing facilities and critical mineral facilities from the requirement to offset emissions as part of the Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) permit process if the President issues a national security determination or if other conditions are met. This is based on a similar provision in Section 173 waiving emission offset requirements for rocket engines.

H.R. ___, Reducing and Eliminating Duplicative Environmental Regulations Act (RED Tape Act)

Amends Section 309 to eliminate the requirement for EPA review and provide written comment on federal construction projects or other actions by a federal agency that are already subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act.

H.R. ___, Foreign Emissions and Nonattainment Clarification for Economic Stability (FENCES Act)

Amends Section 179B to exclude emissions from foreign sources from being used to determine whether an area is attaining a NAAQS and considered as part of NSR permitting.

H.R. ___, Fire Improvement and Reforming Exceptional Events Act (FIRE Act)

Amends Section 319(b) to limit how emissions from wildfires, prescribed burns and exceptional events from the air monitoring data can be used to determine whether an area is attaining a NAAQS and to require increased coordination between EPA and affected states regarding exceptional event determinations.

A September 12th Memorandum from the Committee Majority Staff has the following components:

Clean Air Act Pre-Construction Permitting (discussing the three kinds of Clean Air Act pre-construction review and permit programs [often referred to as New Source Review or NSR Permit Programs]).

Concerns about NSR Permit Process (stating that the permit process involves multiple steps, including public notice and comment, can take several years to complete).

Issues for Discussion:

How frequent changes in regulations and interpretive guidance create uncertainty for the regulated community and regulatory agencies and the role that Congress can play in providing regulatory clarity and simplifying the permitting process.

The impact that air pollution from foreign sources, forest fires, and exceptional events can have on air quality and the ability to obtain pre-construction permits under the NSR permit process.

Challenges that industries critical to national security face in navigating the NSR process and how NAAQS standards that approach background level concentrations impact economic development.

How the Clean Air Act can be modernized to meet the nation’s need for economic security while continuing to deliver clean air and a healthy environment.

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

The allied leaders announced the Technology Prosperity Deal in a press conference at Chequers, the country manor of the British PM in Buckinghamshire northwest of London, claiming that the “win for both sides” could create up to 17,500 new jobs across both nations.

“This trip has galvanized $350 billion in deals across many sectors, and we’re committed to ensuring that the UK is a secure and reliable supply of the best AI, hardware and software on Earth, and we supply that and make sure we supply it in quantity to the UK,” said Trump.

The president later joked it was “a better deal for you than us,” praising Starmer as a tough negotiator, while the PM described the pact as a “good deal” for both countries.

“It’s a blueprint to win this new era together, shape it according to our shared values, and seize the incredible opportunities that are on offer,” Starmer told reporters.

“We have huge new investments from Nvidia, Nscale, Open AI, Google, Salesforce and many more backing cutting-edge British jobs for years to come.”

The investments are expected to result in around 15,000 jobs in the UK, along with the construction of 12 advanced nuclear reactors in the north of England. The US anticipated 2,500 jobs being created in its territory.

The deal would also provide power for up to 1.5 million homes — with both nations optimistic the civil nuclear project will serve energy needs on both sides of the Atlantic.

Trump touted collaboration on “quantum computing, fusion, 6G and civil nuclear energy,” saying the memorandum balanced deregulatory steps with a push toward innovation in those sectors.

James Burnham, who founded an AI policy council in Washington this past July, told The Post that the investments in AI and quantum computing will lower prices for consumers because they’ll allow many industries to operate “at a speed and scale that humanity is not capable of doing.”

“It just has the ability to make our lives better and easier,” said Burnham, who served previously as the top lawyer at the Department of Government Efficiency.

The innovations will largely benefit consumer-facing sectors of the economy, making travel bookings near-instantaneous and rendering the complexity of self-driving cars an easy and widespread phenomenon.

“You’ll have computers doing work that right now is being done by humans,” Burnham added. “AI is going to be really good for customer service and all the process, back-office functions.”

That will also spur growth in US and UK manufacturing,” he claimed.

“For everything from installing home batteries to building data centers to manufacturing battery cells, there’s a lot of hard, human work that has to happen to enable all of these technologies to exist and grow.”

The AI developments will include joint research programs as well as a space partnership between the US and UK.

There will also be an emphasis on chip and data center exports from both countries, as well as enhanced collaboration between the US Center for AI Standards and Innovation and the UK AI Security Institute, both of which regulate the industry.

New nuclear policies will mainly help power the tech boom but also enhance existing non-proliferation and security programs.

Perhaps most crucially, the UK will move toward “full independence from Russian nuclear fuel by the end of 2028,” according to the White House.

Burnham pointed out that most nuclear fuel is exported from China but produced in Russia, posing a major problem for the West.

“Getting the UK on board with not buying Russian enriched uranium is both good on its own, because we don’t want the Russians to be selling nuclear fuel to one of our close allies, but also good for American companies,” he said.

“It’s another great example of ‘America First,’ selling stuff that we make here,” Burnham underscored. “Step one, kick out the Russians; step two, bring in the Americans to make it simpler.”

Quantum technologies, aimed at speeding up computer processing capabilities, will be deployed to “transform defense, finance, and healthcare, protect [US and UK] citizens, and create high-skilled jobs.”

The agreement is due to be put in effect by mid-March of next year.

Formal discussions between the countries updating each other on implementation will take place each year beginning in 2026.

“Firming up international relationships will be critical to American AI success,” Matthew Mittelsteadt, a tech policy researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute, told The Post of the deal.

“To lead this space, the United States needs markets, capital, and data — ‘resources’ that mutually beneficial trade partnerships and openness can provide,” Mittelsteadt said.

“As the United States continues negotiations,” he added, “we should strongly reconsider our current protectionist stance so we can further deepen ties with the UK and others, and reap the benefits of the resources and openness that will follow.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-alsa61d7g-1758221205529.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758206891&w=1024,N,,2025-09-19 12:07:29.729192

A large offshore wind project in Virginia, which has a Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin, is continuing.
“We are talking about so many jobs, so many construction jobs, so many union jobs,” Healey said in an interview this month.","Cesar Lima never gave much thought to the politics of offshore wind. Most days, the ironworker focused on his shift 15 miles out at sea, climbing turbines and watching dolphins gliding past his vessel off the coast of Rhode Island.

That changed when President Donald Trump’s administration ordered work to stop on the Revolution Wind project a month ago.

Lima’s job is now at risk as Trump threatens to shutter offshore wind farms, upending states’ investments to support the clean energy source. The administration’s actions have postponed, if not outright eliminated, years of potential construction work. Altogether, more than 15,000 prospective and current jobs tied to wind projects in New England are under threat from the potential shutdowns, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company and state announcements.

For now, Lima and other specialized union staff are still stationed with the Revolution Wind project, and he’s continuing to get paid. But Lima worries about what comes next for his family, including three children, who depend on his income. Ironworkers on the project earn about $76 an hour with pension and health benefits, typically working 84-hour weeks on four-week rotations, according to David Langlais of the Iron Workers union.

“I just came here to work for my family and I don’t really pay attention to all the political stuff,” Lima said, adding that he was confused why the White House would stop the Revolution project when it’s already 80% completed. “If the work stops and it keeps going like this, it’s going to hurt us.”

Trump has long opposed offshore wind, suing unsuccessfully before he became president to block a project within view of his golf course in Scotland. But the recent escalation of his administration’s battle against the industry risks clashing with simultaneous claims that the White House’s policies are fueling investment and job growth.

The bulk of potential job losses stem from government actions targeting several wind farms off the New England coast. The US Interior Department issued a stop-work order in August for the Revolution Wind farm, which is being built by Denmark’s Orsted A/S and Global Infrastructure Partners. The Revolution project supports more than 2,000 jobs, about half of which are union roles, according to Orsted.

The wind farm venture has sued to force the Trump administration to allow work to restart on the project. Revolution Wind has said it’s already spent $5 billion on the project and is now at risk of incurring an estimated $1 billion in breakaway costs.

“We have invested a significant amount of time and money” to support offshore wind, Rhode Island Democratic Governor Dan McKee said in an interview, referencing the state’s spending on training programs for workers, port upgrades in Quonset and a new offshore wind construction hub - all of which generated local jobs.

The Trump administration has also moved to reconsider or invalidate permits for other wind projects near Massachusetts that have yet to start construction but were expected to create more than 13,100 jobs on a combined basis. In addition, the US Transportation Department yanked $34 million in funding for a new port in Salem, Massachusetts, that was meant to support the offshore wind industry. That project was slated to create an additional 800 construction jobs.

Last week, the administration asked a court to cancel the approval of a $6 billion wind project planned off Maryland’s coast. A large offshore wind project in Virginia, which has a Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin, is continuing.

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center has projected employment in climate-friendly power production would need to grow to more than 140,000 jobs by the end of the decade in order for the state to meet its climate goals. The state organization has already spent more than $20 million in total on offshore wind job-training programs. Last year, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey signed a bill authorizing $200 million of investments to support offshore wind, an attempt to establish the state as a global clean energy hub in the same way it’s evolved into a life sciences mecca.

“We are talking about so many jobs, so many construction jobs, so many union jobs,” Healey said in an interview this month. “There’s been a lot of investment in this workforce, actually, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Don’t let that go to waste.”

Governors and labor leaders warn that the push to halt offshore wind development will also weigh on the manufacturing and commercial fishing industries, exacerbating the labor market impact.

“The offshore jobs are one thing, and they’re significant, but we were starting to develop the infrastructure for the industry itself,” said Frank Callahan, president of the Massachusetts Building Trades Unions.

About 80 fishermen in Rhode Island and Connecticut work for Sea Services North America, a co-op that was formed with support from Orsted to investigate potential risks to marine life from Revolution Wind’s construction. Another 100 work in similar roles across other states on the East Coast. In total, the co-op deploys 22 independent commercial fishing vessels with the work earning the participating fishermen an extra $24 million in income over four years.

“Most of our group are Trump supporters,” said Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services North America. “We’ve demonstrated that co-existence of commercial fisherman and offshore wind is possible. Nobody understands. It defies logic.”

Orsted also footed half the bill for a $1 million training facility in Rhode Island. The school has already trained nearly 200 students in skills such as first aid, fire awareness and special instruction for working at heights and living at sea for extended periods. The majority of course participants are union electricians and iron workers, according to Rosemary Costigan, president of the Community College of Rhode Island, which hosts the training facility on its campus.

“These are good-paying jobs, sustainable wages that the workers can have,” Costigan said. “We were on the precipice of actually expanding out and being able to recruit to a wider student audience.”

For Georgians interested in saving on the purchase of an electric vehicle, rooftop solar panels or a heat pump, the clock is ticking — fast.

This summer, Republicans in Congress locked in key parts of President Donald Trump’s agenda when they passed the “One big, beautiful bill.” The legislation extended corporate and individual tax cuts created in Trump’s first term, and increased border security and defense spending.

But the law also dented many of President Joe Biden’s signature accomplishments, including rolling back federal incentives meant to encourage Americans to switch to EVs or reduce home energy use. Electrifying homes and automobiles reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality and often saves money.

Home energy rebates

Next January will spell the end of most federal clean energy tax credits, but there are rebates for home energy upgrades that will still be available in Georgia for the next several years.

There are two programs: The Home Efficiency Rebates program, offering savings for energy-efficient home retrofits, and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program, that can slash the cost of heat pumps, electric stoves and more.

Georgia received just under $220 million to distribute for the two programs — money allocated by President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that was not clawed back by Trump’s “One big, beautiful bill.”

Georgians can save as much as $16,000 on efficiency upgrades through the HER program and up to $14,000 off the cost of eligible appliances. But not everyone qualifies for the full rebates — savings depend on how each household’s income stacks up with the median in their area.

The rebates will be available through Sept. 30, 2031, or until the funding runs out.

TRENTON, NJ - New Jersey LCV, the leading political voice for the environment in New Jersey, announced its 2025 endorsements for the New Jersey Assembly and local races in the 2025 general election, as well as their continued enthusiastic support and endorsement of Mikie Sherrill for Governor. New Jersey LCV is a nonpartisan organization whose mission is to elect environmental champions, and is the only New Jersey environmental group with a Political Action Committee (PAC) and Super PAC.

New Jersey LCV announced these endorsements after receiving questionnaires from over 100 candidates. In a critical year for elections, the organization is making its largest ever investment in elections, spending $100,000 in legislative and down ballot elections.

“With Washington rolling back environmental protections, it’s more important than ever that we elect state and local champions who will fight for our right to clean air, safe drinking water, and healthy communities,” said Allison McLeod, Deputy Director, New Jersey LCV. “That’s why we’ve endorsed candidates up and down the ballot—from Governor and Assembly to county and local races—because every level of government plays a role. From tackling flooding and air pollution to protecting open space from warehouse sprawl, state and local leaders are on the front lines of this fight, and they need our support now more than ever. The stakes have never been higher.”

New Jersey LCV is also proud to continue their enthusiastic support and endorsement for Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, an environmental champion, for Governor during the general election cycle. Congresswoman Sherrill’s leadership in Washington and on the ground in New Jersey has made a critical difference in securing multiple major legislative victories in recent years that boosted cost-saving clean energy, protected New Jersey communities from the impacts of climate change, safeguarded clean drinking water, and created union jobs.

“Based on Mikie Sherrill’s outstanding record of environmental leadership in Congress, New Jersey LCV concluded she is far and away the best candidate to deliver bold environmental policy leadership that will make a crucial difference in fighting the climate crisis, lowering electricity costs, and protecting our environment and every New Jersey family’s right to breathe clean air and drink pure water,” said Randy Jones, New Jersey LCV C4 Board Chair.

New Jersey LCV has also endorsed a diverse group of 46 candidates for Assembly, including 22 women and 14 BIPOC candidates, representative of the constituencies in which they serve.

We’re proud to have stood shoulder to shoulder with them in the Assembly and look forward to continuing to do so, pushing for bold action every step of the way.”

Local and county governments are on the front lines of tackling issues such air quality, flooding, and preserving open space from warehouse sprawl. Local elected officials are empowered to make critical land use, development, water quality, and preservation, and funding decisions that play an outsize role in environmental protection, which is why it is critical to have environmental champions at every level of government - particularly in a time when we see federal protections being rolled back.

Since its first local endorsement process in 2020 with 26 endorsements, New Jersey LCV has seen the number of candidates moving through the process grow exponentially, demonstrating the importance of environmental protection to residents across the state. From the endorsed local candidates this year, 32% are people of color, 51% women, and 3% identify as LGBTQ+.

“When it comes to protecting our environment, local races matter just as much as statewide and federal elections. The decisions made by local officials shape how our communities respond to flooding, invest in clean energy, preserve open space, and safeguard our air and water. By electing environmental champions at every level of government, we ensure New Jersey communities can thrive with cleaner air, healthier lands, and stronger protections against climate change,” said Jaclyn Rhoads, New Jersey LCV, Political Chair.

The shift has left clean energy companies struggling, communities losing good-paying jobs, and America’s leadership in renewable energy hanging in the balance.","The future of America’s renewable energy industry—and the millions of clean energy jobs it supports—is under threat from recent policy shifts by the Trump administration. A new report from national nonpartisan business group E2 warns that federal rollbacks on clean energy support are already driving widespread job losses in wind, solar, and other fast-growing energy transition sectors.

Over the past decade, clean energy jobs in the United States consistently outpaced employment growth in conventional energy sectors. In 2024 alone, nearly 100,000 new positions were created across renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation—bringing the nationwide total to 3.56 million jobs. More than 80% of all new energy jobs last year came from clean energy.

But this upward trend is now reversing. According to the E2 report, “recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come.”

“Clean energy was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the nation at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s Executive Director. “Now, thanks to regressive policies, America’s clean energy job growth is at serious risk—and with it, our overall economy.”

Since President Trump took office, nearly $19 billion worth of wind and solar power projects have been cancelled, according to U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy. The sharp reduction in federal support—through subsidy cuts and weakened regulatory backing—has triggered bankruptcies, collapsing stock prices, and project cancellations totalling $18.6 billion.

The shift has left clean energy companies struggling, communities losing good-paying jobs, and America’s leadership in renewable energy hanging in the balance. With local opposition to new projects adding to the uncertainty, industry leaders warn that without strong, consistent federal policy, the United States risks falling behind in the global clean energy race.",https://hydrogenindustryleaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Firefly_Clean-energy-vs-decline-—-half-the-image-shows-bright-wind-turbines-solar-panels-an-964153.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 13:01:51.917606

In Plaquemines Parish, generations worked in the oilfield, their livelihoods dependent on continued oil and gas industry investment.
But in the first of 42 cases to go to trial, a Plaquemines jury found Chevron responsible for about 25% of $2.7 billion in damages to the parish.
Those are the facts that recently led a jury to hold Chevron accountable for its role in the destruction of the Louisiana coastline.
The Chevron case is a textbook case of pollution and direct permitting violations, not vague nuisance claims.","Louisiana is unapologetically pro-energy. Our people proudly support and participate in exploration, production and refining oil and gas.

We won’t apologize for powering our nation. As Louisiana’s attorney general, I led the nation fighting the Biden administration’s flawed energy policies. Louisiana successfully blocked a moratorium on oil and gas leasing and led the attack on overzealous permitting requirements, a ban on LNG exports, flawed social cost of carbon metrics and more.

But fighting for responsible energy policy does not require us to ignore environmental impacts. In its continued efforts to avoid accountability, however, Chevron and its surrogates are taking a new tack: misdirection. Chevron’s strategy is flawed for two reasons: First, its conduct is indefensible; and second, it’s just plain wrong in its characterization of the coastal zone litigation.

The trial that took place in Plaquemines Parish is a good example of what’s necessary to impose liability. In Plaquemines Parish, generations worked in the oilfield, their livelihoods dependent on continued oil and gas industry investment.

But in the first of 42 cases to go to trial, a Plaquemines jury found Chevron responsible for about 25% of $2.7 billion in damages to the parish.

How did such an oil and gas industry friendly jury reach such a result? Easy: Because the evidence revealed Chevron’s predecessor Texaco unlawfully dumped four billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the Louisiana marsh for decades, while knowingly and intentionally ignoring permitting requirements.

At the same time, it profited from selling storage to other oil companies. Those are the facts that recently led a jury to hold Chevron accountable for its role in the destruction of the Louisiana coastline. Even then, the jury only held Chevron accountable for about 25% of the damage, recognizing that other factors contributed to some of the damage.

The coastal cases are distinctly different from frivolous climate change “nuisance” lawsuits, contrary to Chevron’s attempts to characterize them as the same. I have vigorously opposed those kinds of actions because even if such a cause of action could supply a vehicle to sue, proving that a particular defendant’s actions directly caused particular damage is virtually impossible.

Not so with the coastal suits: These lawsuits require proof that a particular defendant engaged in unlawful activity before 1980 that continued after 1980, and that caused actual identifiable harm.

The Chevron case is a textbook case of pollution and direct permitting violations, not vague nuisance claims. From the mid-1940s through the mid-1980s, Texaco discharged four billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the marsh in the Delacroix field. This was an illegal discharge under then-applicable rules and regulations.

It gets worse. Texaco flatly ignored the permitting rules established under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978. The linchpin for liability is proof of activity continuing after the act’s Sept. 20, 1980, effective date.

There were safer alternatives. Use of disposal wells was the industry standard, as Texaco’s internal documents and its operations elsewhere proved. And it was feasible — several sites could have been converted at minimal expense.

Texaco even owned a disposal well in a nearby field and charged other companies to dispose of their toxic wastewater, while dumping Texaco’s own waste into our marsh. This conduct continued until the late 1980s, while Texaco lied to regulatory authorities about its activities, including dates of discharge, volumes and lab data.

Dumping 4.2 billion gallons of toxic waste for four decades into our marsh was irresponsible and illegal. But why does Chevron have to pay? Because it assumed the liabilities of Texaco, and it has profited (and continues to profit) from that purchase.

The verdict did not hold Chevron accountable for damage it did not cause, such as erosion caused by hydrology changes or hurricanes. The Plaquemines jury award of $745 million reflects thoughtful deliberation, not “hometown” justice.

The facts disproved Chevron’s case — it lied about its conduct being lawful; it lied about the duration of its unlawful activity; and it lied about the breadth of its unlawful activity.

Quite simply, Chevron chose profits over people and the law — and it continues to do so every day it refuses accountability for its actions. This is not controversial.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/19/d1937e29-c2b1-47f0-928e-a3edef325f7a/5d14d7cc41ec9.image.jpg?crop=600%2C315%2C0%2C30,N,,2025-09-19 13:03:06.370015

We the undersigned unequivocally condemn the murder of Charlie Kirk and all forms of political violence. There is simply no place for such actions in the United States.

Political violence has targeted those of every political persuasion and of no political persuasion. It is un-American and wrong to use this act of violence as a pretext for weaponizing the government to threaten nonprofit and charitable organizations, other perceived adversaries, or any class of people. They did not commit this murder, and the vast powers of the government should not be abused to threaten their constitutionally-protected free speech and other rights.

Nonprofit and charitable organizations support critical services to our nation – working with faith communities, caring for vulnerable populations, upholding the Constitution, defending the rule of law and much more. Attacks on nonprofits and charities threaten that essential work happening everywhere across our country.

We implore the government to cease its escalation of political division, and stop the unjustified targeting of organizations and people in the wake of this terrible act of political violence.

This moment of tragedy does not call for exploiting a horrific act to further deepen our divides and make us less safe. It calls for unity–unity against violence and unity of purpose as Americans.

He added that Climate change is already affecting farms, the health sector, and even the safety of the communities.
The meeting concluded with a validated draft of NDC 3.0, including clear targets for reducing emissions, adapting to climate change, and finding financing options.","Ganta, September 17, 2025-The Government of Liberia, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), held a one-day climate consultation in Ganta, Nimba County, as part of efforts to finalize the country’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0) under the Paris Agreement.

The NDC is Liberia’s national plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience against climate change. The Ganta consultation brought together government officials, civil society groups, women and youth organizations, academia, the private sector, and development partners to ensure the updated plan reflects the needs and voices of communities across the country.

EPA’s Director of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), Arthur R.M. Becker, explained the importance of the meeting. He said:

“The fight against climate change is for everyone and cannot be left with the government alone. That is why we came to Ganta to sit with our people, listen to their concerns, and include them in this plan”

According to him, the Paris Agreement requires countries to act, but Liberia’s NDC 3.0 must not only answer to the world, it must respond to the realities in our towns, villages, and cities. When people take ownership, when they see their voices in the plan, then the plan becomes stronger and workable.

He stessed that the process is about building trust and showing that climate action is a shared responsibility.

“NDC 3.0 is not starting from scratch. It builds on the efforts we made in 2015 and 2021. We have spent months talking to communities, doing technical studies, and engaging stakeholders. This updated plan will guide Liberia in cutting down emissions, preparing for climate impacts, and attracting support from partners. It is a blueprint for action, investment, and inclusive development. The goal is to create a plan that is realistic, practical, and achievable., Mr. Becker added.

Also speaking, Louis Kuukpen, UNDP Resident Representative encouraged participants to make their voices heard.

According to him, UNDP is proud to walk with Liberia on the journey.

He added that Climate change is already affecting farms, the health sector, and even the safety of the communities.

“These consultations are not just formal meetings; they are opportunities for women, youth, farmers, and other vulnerable groups to help guide the decisions that will shape Liberia’s future. When communities are part of the discussion, the solutions become more practical and fair. Together, with unity and shared commitment, we can build a Liberia that is stronger, greener, and safer for generations to come.”, he added.

Following the consultations, a technical validation meeting was held on September 12, 2025, in Tubmanburg, Bomi County, with over 25 representatives from government, local authorities, civil society, academia, and development partners. The meeting provided a chance to review and strengthen the draft NDC 3.0.

The meeting concluded with a validated draft of NDC 3.0, including clear targets for reducing emissions, adapting to climate change, and finding financing options.",https://epa.gov.lr/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/epa-logo-90x90.png,N,,2025-09-19 14:06:03.016769

Congress must act without delay to pass this measure and ensure the VA can continue delivering lifesaving services to veterans and their families.
Again, we urge U.S. House members to support the CR.” Unify.US: “Unify.US strongly supports H.R.
5371, a clean, short-term continuing resolution that will keep the government open while Congress continues to work on a full-year funding package.
Shutting the government down while this work continues is irresponsible and will be harmful to the American people.” Vietnam Veterans of America: “Congress must ensure no lapse in veterans’ care or benefits.","WASHINGTON – Today, Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) announced key stakeholder support for the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026. This bill keeps the government open, allows House Republicans to continue advancing the America First agenda, and serves the American people while Congress continues working through the regular order appropriations process.

Here is what stakeholders are saying about the bill:

Aerospace Industries Association (AIA): “AIA urges Congress to pass this continuing resolution that will keep the government open, maintaining critical functions to protect national security, prevent delays in air travel, and allow innovation to continue. While we understand that Congress needs more time to hammer out details for a funding bill for fiscal year 2026, a full shutdown has serious implications that will reverberate throughout the aerospace and defense supply chain for months, causing major disruptions. We encourage both the House and the Senate to swiftly pass this bill.”

America First Policy Institute (AFPI), Greg Sindelar, Acting President and Chief Executive Officer: “The only way to keep our country on the path to delivering the America First Agenda and meaningful change is for Congress to consider and pass a clean CR before the September 30th deadline. Continuing America’s comeback success means funding our government. Failing to protect our economic and national security interests at home and abroad would diminish this momentum.”

American Telemedicine Association (ATA) Action, Kyle Zebley, Executive Director of ATA Action and Senior Vice President of Public Policy at the ATA: “We are mere days away from having telehealth services lapse, leaving literally millions of patients across the country with no access to necessary care and our healthcare providers helpless to deliver that care. ATA Action supports and endorses the short-term continuing resolution language put forward by U.S. House leadership that extends Medicare telehealth flexibilities and the Acute Hospital Care at Home program through November 21. This is the only viable legislative vehicle up for consideration that will ensure these essential programs do not lapse past the end of the month.”

Americans for Prosperity (AFP), Brent Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer: “This continuing resolution is a necessary step to avoid a harmful and unnecessary government shutdown. While we support this short-term measure, we do so because the alternative—shutting down the government—is worse and would harm all Americans.”

AMVETS, Joe Chenelly, National Executive Director: “AMVETS supports the passage of the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026, which contains vital extensions for the Department of Veterans Affairs. These provisions safeguard critical programs, including the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program, the Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Program, and the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program. Congress must act without delay to pass this measure and ensure the VA can continue delivering lifesaving services to veterans and their families. Looking ahead, AMVETS encourages Congress to prioritize timely, full-year appropriations to provide the VA with the stability and predictability needed to best serve our nation's veterans.”

CTIA, Ajit Pai, President and Chief Executive Officer: “We support the extension of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 included in the House of Representative’s Continuing Resolution. CISA 2015 established a vital legal framework that enables trusted cyber threat information sharing between the public and private sectors, and this collaboration has strengthened cybersecurity efforts across critical infrastructure, including wireless networks. This will ensure Americans continue to be protected from evolving cyber threats while Congress pursues a long-term extension of the Act.”

Independent Women, Patrice Onwuka, Director of the Center for Economic Opportunity: “This clean continuing resolution is a necessary step to keeping the government running even as Congress does the good work to pass responsible appropriations bills through regular order. Americans did not vote for a dysfunctional government. They want a right-sized government, and so far, this Congress has taken that mandate seriously. Furthermore, in light of the horrendous slaying of Charlie Kirk, this CR provides members of Congress with additional protections so that they can serve their constituents. We urge all members to pass this clean CR to prevent disruptions to national security, public safety, veterans care, and social safety net programs while bringing back fiscal responsibility.”

Mission Roll Call: “Mission Roll Call calls on Congress to ensure uninterrupted funding for critical VA programs — including the Fox Suicide Prevention Grants, Supportive Services for Veteran Families, and Health Care for Homeless Veterans. These are lifelines for veterans and their families, and their continuation must be guaranteed without interruption.”

National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), Lake A. Coulson, Senior Vice President & Chief Lobbyist: “On behalf of the more than 140,000 members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am writing in support of H.R. 5371, the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026 that would continue to fund operations of the federal government including the extension of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) until November 21…NAHB believes that it is critically important for the economy, and the housing industry specifically, that Congress extend this vital program to provide certainty, predictability, and peace of mind to policyholders who rely on the NFIP for the flood protection and mitigation strategies for which it was designed.”

National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), Tanner Beymer, Executive Director of Government Affairs: “NCBA is encouraged by the progress congressional leaders have made in appropriations this year. A shutdown at this juncture would only stymie this momentum and further disrupt business in cattle country. This stopgap spending bill affords the House and Senate necessary time to bolster crucial agriculture programs and enact key policies through the budget process. We urge lawmakers to swiftly adopt the continuing resolution.”

Small Business & Entrepreneurship (SBE) Council, Karen Kerrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer: “SBE Council strongly supports the CR and urges every U.S. House member to vote in favor of this sensible step to keep the federal government open, allowing for discussions to continue on longer-term funding matters. Small business owners, their employees, and local communities are still transitioning through the effects of past policies that imposed multi-year inflationary pressures and higher borrowing costs, among other challenges. They need certainty and confidence that elected officials and government leaders are delivering on stability, not disruptive action that could potentially undermine growth and planning. Advancing the CR signals that Congress is serious about supporting a stable environment and getting back to regular order. Again, we urge U.S. House members to support the CR.”

Unify.US: “Unify.US strongly supports H.R. 5371, a clean, short-term continuing resolution that will keep the government open while Congress continues to work on a full-year funding package. Shutting the government down while this work continues is irresponsible and will be harmful to the American people.”

Vietnam Veterans of America: “Congress must ensure no lapse in veterans’ care or benefits. Extending critical authorities for nursing home care, rural access, and community-care capacity is essential to protect our most vulnerable veterans while longer-term solutions advance.”

The agency’s role in judging planning applications is enshrined in law, but Reeves is working on a planning and infrastructure bill that could rip up many of the rules around permitted developments.
Choking the role of the Environment Agency and fettering their independence goes against all principles of good regulation.”","The Environment Agency has been told by ministers to wave through planning applications with minimal resistance as part of a regulatory shakeup designed to increase economic growth and plug the government’s financial hole.

Officials at the agency say they have been told to do as little as legally possible to prevent housing applications from being approved and the government has drafted in senior advisers from the housing department to speed up the process.

Some believe the existence of the agency is under threat given Rachel Reeves’s push to eliminate government quangos as part of her dash for growth. Government officials insist this is not the case.

There is a wider push from the chancellor to inject more urgency into housing and infrastructure development, which she is hoping will help her fill a multibillion-pound hole at the next budget.

But environmental campaigners warn that clipping the wings of the Environment Agency could harm wildlife and the natural world.

One agency source said the staff from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) were “pushing development at any cost”.

They added: “We are taking a step back from planning and the organisational steer is to do the minimum required to fulfil our legal duties but nothing more. They are seeking legal advice as to what the minimum they can get away with is.”

They added: “There are lots of examples of where nature and development happen together, but going forwards, the EA doesn’t seem to want to be part of it.”

An Environment Agency spokesperson said they did not recognise the claims, but acknowledged that MHCLG staff had been brought into the agency. They added: We have received no directions to wave planning applications through. The EA continues to provide robust technical advice to ensure that environmental protections are considered in planning decisions. The government’s ambitious target for building 1.5m new homes is vital. To support this, we have rapidly reformed our planning service, now provide advice consistently within the 21-day deadline and use our technical expertise to achieve the best outcomes for the environment and economic growth.”

Reeves has told ministers to make a fresh push to cull quangos that their departments oversee, with sources indicating that the environment department has been singled out.

The department, whose new secretary of state, Emma Reynolds, was previously a Treasury minister, controls 37 agencies, including Natural England, the Environment Agency and the Office for Environmental Protection.

Ministers in this government and the previous Conservative administration have expressed frustration at the ability of some of the environmental regulators to hold up development. The chancellor has blamed them for choking economic growth by demanding developers build expensive wildlife protections such as the infamous £100m “bat tunnel” over the HS2 high-speed rail line.

The Environment Agency polices nutrient neutrality rules which ban developments in dozens of regions across the country if they are predicted to add to nutrients to nearby rivers.

The rules are in place to prevent the buildup of algae and other plants, which can choke off aquatic life, but have been blamed for the lack of housebuilding in certain areas.

The agency’s role in judging planning applications is enshrined in law, but Reeves is working on a planning and infrastructure bill that could rip up many of the rules around permitted developments. New rules could also be included in the forthcoming water bill.

Environmental campaigners say removing the agency entirely from the planning process could damage British wildlife.

Ali Plummer, the director of policy and advocacy at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Deregulation won’t speed up nature recovery; it will just leave us with poorly designed developments, increased pollution and lower access to nature. Weaker regulation is not the foundation to build from for the next generation.”

Alexa Culver, a lawyer at the ecological consultancy RSK Wilding, said: “Properly funded and independent regulators are an essential part of any thriving economy. Choking the role of the Environment Agency and fettering their independence goes against all principles of good regulation.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0f6a7222b691f2e02a5679071ffeb55f0eeaf51/568_26_6769_5415/master/6769.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e15e42677806cc63cbdbcf2b79f6748e",N,,2025-09-19 12:06:14.762468

Missouri can lead the way,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/american-data-centers-are-key-beating-china-ai-race-missouri-can-lead-way,"Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” highlighted the critical connection between significant advances in science and technology and our national security.
A July executive order will cut federal red tape and streamline permitting to fast-track construction of U.S. data centers.
Why shouldn’t northeast, central or southeast Missouri play a major role in powering the national AI race?
But we need to do it strategically ensuring (1) American data centers are sited in appropriate locations and (2) local communities where the centers are located get answers to all legitimate questions about the projects.
Winning the AI race against China will not be easy.","As a kid growing up in southeast Missouri, I watched the moon landing in awe. America had done it! Our astronauts were the first to walk on the moon’s surface.

It wasn’t until I was elected to represent Missouri in Congress that I more fully appreciated the generational impact “winning the space race” had on America’s global influence and national security.

Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” highlighted the critical connection between significant advances in science and technology and our national security. Only by harnessing these innovations did we ensure that this new space frontier would be led by Americans instead of the Soviets. In the decades following the moon landing, America enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and national security, which eventually culminated in our victory in the Cold War.

Headlines today echo those in the 1960’s. This time our national security and prosperity are threatened by another global foe — the People’s Republic of China — and they are attempting to harness technological advances to reshape the world in their image.

Instead of space, this new race is taking place in the digital world of artificial intelligence, or AI. Simply put, if we allow China to overtake America as the world’s leader in AI, it could create insecurity for our fellow citizens for decades to come.

What will fuel our nation’s AI dominance is our ability to efficiently and effectively ramp up construction of American data centers, including the massive amounts of energy it takes to run them.

For the past three years, China has invested billions to be an AI superpower in hopes of catching up to the U.S. Consequently, a lack of data center development here in America’s heartland would be a disaster and play right into their hands.

As part of the White House’s American AI Action Plan, President Donald Trump has chartered a course for America to cement our dominance in artificial intelligence. A July executive order will cut federal red tape and streamline permitting to fast-track construction of U.S. data centers.

According to the Trump administration, winning the AI race represents the “cornerstone of innovation, powering a new age of American leadership in science, technology, and global influence.”

Over the next year or two many of the decisions on where this new high-tech industry will invest, create jobs and grow are being made.

Why shouldn’t northeast, central or southeast Missouri play a major role in powering the national AI race?

In addition to a well-trained and eager workforce, the eastern side of the Show-Me State is home to some of the most affordable electricity in the country — including rates 29% lower than the national average.

A proactive effort to site and build data centers will complement the recent push to make the St. Louis region a defense tech hub. The National Geospatial Lab is set to open next year and the White House recently announced that the next-generation F-47 fighter jets will be built in St. Louis by Boeing.

I applaud policymakers in Jefferson City who are doing their part to implement this AI Action Plan here in Missouri.

Gov. Mike Kehoe signed legislation in April that will enable Missouri to generate more home-grown electricity, including next-generation nuclear power. The new state law directs energy producers to create user-friendly policies for large data center customers and ensures that utilities pay their fair share of service costs. This forward-thinking legislation is a strong signal that Missouri is open for business and our grid will continue to have the capacity to serve businesses and homes in our local communities, including data centers.

These efforts have quickly attracted new data center opportunities. In fact, the St. Louis region is on the cusp of being the possible home to several major data centers. These projects would be among the largest construction projects in Missouri’s history, creating jobs and growing our economy. In these scenarios, local communities win because of the significant tax revenues data centers will generate, including millions of dollars in property taxes.

Putting Missouri on the map as a national leader is exciting and important.

But we need to do it strategically ensuring (1) American data centers are sited in appropriate locations and (2) local communities where the centers are located get answers to all legitimate questions about the projects. The recent pause on a St. Charles-area data center was a good example that transparency and communication about these transformational developments cannot be shortchanged.

Winning the AI race against China will not be easy. Many states and locales will allow the forces of status quo and NIMBY to prevail and lose out on these cutting-edge opportunities. But other communities which embrace these high-tech investments are likely to reverse decades of lost manufacturing jobs and witness positive economic and population growth.

Imagine a scenario — in rural Missouri or downtown St. Louis — where the “jobs of the future” exist. Young professionals and jobseekers won’t need to leave Missouri in search of a career but can instead stay, raise families and help their own local communities grow and thrive.

What's happening?

Many federal energy tax credits are ending at the end of 2025, so this campaign is designed to help as many families qualify for those credits as possible. They apply to heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, rooftop solar, battery storage, and a range of other electrification and clean energy upgrades for your home.

""Congress's decision to repeal [IRA incentives] prematurely means households should act fast,"" Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said, per Electrek. ""But the savings, comfort, and long-term value of these upgrades remain. For homeowners ready to act, we have the tools to help. And for those who need more time, we're working to expand your options and ensure that these upgrades make financial sense whenever the moment is right.""

Why is scheduling your upgrade now important?

Heating is most households' largest expense when it comes to energy use at home. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, space heating accounted for 42% of home energy bills in 2020. If you want to lower those bills — not to mention reduce your energy usage to protect the planet from pollution — one of the best moves you can make is to upgrade your HVAC system. If you do it quickly, while the IRA incentives are still available, it will be much more affordable.

For help doing that, try a trusted brand like Mitsubishi, which can help you find the right heat pump option for your home, such as one of its cost-effective mini-split systems. Heat pumps outperform traditional HVAC in terms of energy efficiency while delivering both heating and cooling.

That's on top of other financial benefits such as the tax credits available through the IRA. Mitsubishi can even help connect you with trained professionals who will help you install your new HVAC system.

What's being done about getting upgrades done quickly?

Rewiring America is helping as many people take advantage of the incentives as possible by providing a central hub where residents can get educated about the available incentives, offering weekly sessions where you can ask questions about your situation, providing a directory of contractors and installers, and helping you map out your project through a planner.

Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.
She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.” “Everyone breathing in California depends on it,” he said.","The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles the Trump administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.

Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.

Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.

“I’ve worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I’m ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”

Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.

“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”

California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition

Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.

Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”

But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”

While Randolph’s air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.

“Liane didn’t have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”

For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists. In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.

Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the board through a difficult time.

In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions.

“She’s always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”

Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions.

The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.

“There’s not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration’s attacks on all of California’s efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California’s authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.

“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”

Searing climate battles at home

Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel.

The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.

Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties.

“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.

Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.

“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what’s working — and what’s not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that’s not something staff have ever embraced.”

Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.

Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.

Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.

“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.

Newsom’s point person steps in

Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.

Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”

Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.

“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”

Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.

“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.

Next week, the state’s top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.

Many of the air board’s recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost.","EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — In the soft dirt of an indoor horseback riding ring last month, a group of farmers got ready to test drive a new piece of equipment: an electric tractor.

As they took turns climbing in — some surprised by its quick acceleration — they gave real-time feedback to the Michigan State University researchers who have been developing it for over two years.

The farmers remarked on the motor's quiet whir. Most were intrigued, or at least open to the idea. Some were concerned that the battery on the underside of the carriage would mean a lower clearance over the field, while others worried that it would simply be too expensive.

“What we hope to do when we retire is we want to get everything electric on the farm. The tractor is the last electric implement to get,” said Don Dunklee, one of the farmers to provide feedback. He runs a small organic vegetable farm that's relied on wind and solar for decades.

The market is fairly new, but some researchers and entrepreneurs think electric tractors will be ideal for small farmers who care about sustainability and want to market their products that way. The small cherry-red, open-cab machine is well-suited for tasks like weeding fields of specialty crops like carrots or asparagus, or squeezing between the tight rows of orchard trees. Farmers with solar panels can avoid the cost of diesel.

Agriculture is among the largest sources of climate-warming emissions worldwide. Though tractors are a small culprit, experts believe an environmentally friendly machine would still attract buyers interested in sustainability.

“There’s reduced emissions, but before you get there, you have to be solving for other problems,” including noise, ease of use and cost, said Derek Muller, business manager for battery electric systems at John Deere.

There are downsides — electric tractors are aimed at filling a niche, not overturning the status quo. And while battery technology has come a long way, they can’t last all day or match the massive horsepower of a diesel engine that sets giant tractors cruising through the sprawling grain and soybean operations of the Midwest.

Why few companies offer electric tractor options, and who wants them

In addition to battery limitations, there are other structural obstacles. Most farmers do not have fast electric chargers, nor do they have solar panels to supply those chargers with free electricity — diesel would need to be much more expensive for the economics to turn sharply in favor of electric. But companies are starting to see an opportunity.

“For John Deere, it is not the only solution,” Muller said. “It’s not going to be where we lead our efforts. It’s going to be one of many options.”

The company has built a small utility electric tractor prototype. It joins a limited set of offerings from other companies like Monarch Tractor, which started in 2019 with the aim to help farmers, who have traditionally struggled with razor-thin profits, save money, work sustainably and more efficiently.

Ajit Srivastava, an agricultural engineer and Michigan State professor who hosted the farmer feedback session, wants to help smallholder farmers across the world. Such farmers grow about a third of the world’s food but many do it with only hand tools. He started trying to emulate a pair of oxen made of off-the-shelf parts, so anyone could build it themselves.

“If we were to mechanize all the smallholder farmers in the world, there isn’t enough diesel out there to power them. So we have to find some other source,” Srivastava said.

It's still a work in progress. Rain had postponed the feedback session, originally planned for the spring, because the tractor hadn't been waterproofed yet. It also doesn't have enough power for some jobs like tilling. But farmers generally like what Srivastava had developed. He hopes it could eventually be sold for roughly $30,000, substantially cheaper than some of the competition.

“The steering is really responsive. It just seems to run really smooth,” said Dunklee, adding, however, that it might not do everything he needs on a farm yet. “Probably the biggest thing would be it’s relatively quiet.”

Muller said they're seeing demand for electric tractors from Europe, where farming policies are sometimes more progressive. And there's also a market at universities in other countries where researchers are studying agriculture, said Brendan Dowdle, chief business officer of Bonsai Robotics, which sells modular, automated electric farm robots that can work together to mimic some tasks ordinarily done by a tractor.

One possible customer is the so-called “gentleman farmer” who has a small operation of specialty crops or vegetables and farms for fun, not necessarily to make a living.

“They want to be self-sustaining,” said Patrick Woolcock, an associate engineering professor and agriculture expert at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls.

Plus, without harmful diesel emissions, they can work in greenhouses and, with fewer parts, there's hope repairs won't be as complicated, at least once a readily available supply is established.

Could electric tractors be more compatible with automation?

Some entrepreneurs see electric tractors as a step on the path to automation — fewer workers, more efficiency and less cost. Engineers are now designing machines that will drive themselves and power precise weeders and planters.

For example, Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa noted that if a self-guided tractor gets stuck and has to notify the farmer, electric power has clear benefits. A diesel tractor would sit there idling, but an electric one doesn’t waste fuel while waiting.

Srivastava also said he's just trying to make people's lives easier — looking backward all day to make sure a plow is operating properly is grueling. So, a self-driving tractor would let farmers pay more attention to ensuring harvesting is happening properly, or the weeder isn't accidentally digging up crops.

""Not that we want to take the operator off the tractor, the operator would be there, but they can focus on how well the operation is going rather than making sure the tractor is in the rows,"" he said.

Still, some aren’t so sure electric has such a big advantage when it comes to automation. Tim Bucher, CEO of Agtonomy, a company focused on bringing autonomy software to farm vehicles, was all-in on electric a few years ago. But the technology has gotten so good that now his customers can pick and choose the energy source for their tractor and see similar results, he said. And with government electric vehicle subsidies disappearing, there's less incentive for most farmers to go that route.

On his own farm, though, he opts for electric, and he says he's seen economic returns.

And from an environmental perspective, “it also just makes me feel better,” he said.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?","You might imagine nuclear power plants as behemoth facilities spanning hundreds of acres. Nuclear microreactors, by contrast, could sit on land the size of a football field and power a whole town.

However, after decades of fraught relationships between the nuclear industry and communities in many parts of the U.S., building these tiny reactors requires reckoning with the complex history of nuclear technology and rebuilding public trust.

Microreactor technology for use in towns or cities hasn’t been developed yet, but many researchers have been building the case for its use.

For example, this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.

I’m a nuclear engineer who has been exploring nuclear microreactors’ potential. My research and teaching focuses on some of the questions that would come with placing miniature nuclear reactors close to where people live.

Microreactors: A history

Nuclear microreactors as a technology are both new and old. In the 1940s and ’50s, the American military and government began developing small reactors and nuclear batteries to power submarines and spacecraft.

After developing these small-scale reactors and batteries for various missions, the nuclear industry’s focus shifted to power reactors. They began to rapidly scale up their designs from producing tens of megawatts to the gigawatt-scale systems common around the world today.

These historical reactors were small because scientists were still learning about the physics and engineering underlying these systems. Today, engineers are deliberately designing microreactors to be small.

Microreactors aren’t to be confused with small modular reactors – these are often scaled-down, modularized versions of large reactors. Small, modular reactors can be built as single units or in clusters to achieve the same capacity as a full-size reactor. Microreactors would be smaller than these, with a power capacity under 20 megawatts.

Manufacturing and cost

Because they’re small, microreactors wouldn’t require a massive, multiyear construction project like large nuclear power reactors. Several units could be assembled in a factory each year and shipped off to their final destinations in a truck or on a barge.

Large reactors are not inherently flawed – in many ways, they remain the more economic nuclear energy option. However, electric utility companies have recently hesitated to invest in large reactors because of the multibillion-dollar nature of these projects.

Microreactors require a different but equally significant kind of investment. Though individual units will have a significantly lower price tag, building a factory to produce these microreactors is a massive undertaking. Reactor companies are waiting for their order books to fill up before investing in factories.

It’s a catch-22. Without orders, technology developers are unlikely to build microreactor factories. And future users of these new reactors are unlikely to place orders until this new style of production has been tested and the initial units built.

Future users are also waiting to see what the microreactors will actually cost. Reactor developers have put forward many cost estimates, but in the past, estimates for nuclear reactors haven’t always been reliable. Developers likely won’t know the true numbers until the reactors are actually built.

Initial “first of a kind” units will undoubtedly cost significantly more than later units. As manufacturers learn the best production processes, they’ll be able to make more reactors for less.

In this paradoxical situation in which developers are waiting for orders and users are waiting to see the economics of initial reactors, government funding for building demonstration projects could help usher microreactor technology from early designs to the market.

First movers such as national laboratories, universities, data centers and military bases that are willing to buy these initial reactors also have a role to play in validating the economic feasibility of these new reactors.

Today’s microreactors

In a nuclear reactor, the combination of nuclear fuel and coolant – which is the substance used to both cool the fuel and transport the heat generated by it – used in its design determines what situations it will work best in. Many nonwater coolants can allow reactors to operate at lower pressures, which is a little more safe.

The microreactors being developed today are based on a wide range of reactor technologies and make use of many different combinations of nuclear fuels and coolants.

Some reactors, such as the submarine propulsion reactors, are small, pressurized water reactors – the same basic technology used in most large-scale nuclear power plants. Others use configurations that resemble the small reactors in spacecraft. Still others make use of nuclear fuel and coolant combinations previously attempted in much larger reactors, such as high-temperature gas reactors, sodium fast reactors and even molten salt reactors.

Though encompassing a range of technologies, microreactors are all significantly simpler than the large reactors in use today. In many cases, they have few to no moving parts.

Microreactors, by virtue of being significantly simpler, are going to be more knowable. Because they’re easier to study and understand, simpler reactor systems have fewer points of failure and safety concerns.

Complex systems, such as the large nuclear power reactors, can be fundamentally unknowable, with unexpected entanglements of “unknown unknowns” creating instabilities, safety concerns and potential for failure. Large reactors operate safely today because we have learned about these unknown unknowns over decades of operation. Microreactors, because of their simplicity, will fundamentally be safer and more predictable than the large reactors were when they were first built.

Siting microreactors

Although the Department of Energy oversees microreactor demonstration projects, commercial deployment of microreactors requires approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which could take several years and may ultimately determine how soon commercial reactors can be built. Several designs are now approaching or in the early stages of review.

To keep people safe, large reactors have designated emergency planning zones – usually 10 and 50 miles around – which require different degrees of planning and protection to enter. The 10-mile zone has specific shelters and evacuation plans in place, while people in the 50-mile zone may need to take precautions about what they eat and drink in the event of a catastrophic accident but will not need to evacuate.

Because microreactors are smaller and simpler, developers and regulators may significantly reduce their emergency planning zones. The zones could extend only to the facility’s site boundary, or perhaps a few hundred meters beyond it.

A reduced emergency planning zone could mean that microreactors could be built in towns and cities, or embedded in remote communities. They might one day become as ubiquitous as the solar panels and windmills you see when driving through the countryside. And like the submarine reactors that can power a small underwater community of 100, one microreactor could power a rural town.

But even if siting a nuclear microreactor near a town is technically feasible, would the community accept it?

Public engagement

My lab’s ongoing research suggests that the answer to this question is contingent on how technology developers engage with the communities that may host a microreactor. If they attempt to unilaterally decide, announce and defend their decision to build a microreactor without input, communities will likely push back.

However, if developers work with communities to understand their hopes, concerns and priorities, they will likely find that many people are receptive to hyperlocal nuclear energy facilities.

My team’s initial findings suggest that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach for designing these facilities. Each community will have its own set of preferences that developers will need to navigate alongside the engineering questions.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/688801/original/file-20250902-56-hmf7x0.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C322%2C1201%2C600&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-19 12:06:05.399969

Lima’s job is now at risk as Trump threatens to shutter offshore wind farms, upending states’ investments to support the clean energy source. The administration’s actions have postponed, if not outright eliminated, years of potential construction work. Altogether, more than 15,000 prospective and current jobs tied to wind projects in New England are under threat from the potential shutdowns, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company and state announcements.

For now, Lima and other specialized union staff are still stationed with the Revolution Wind project, and he’s continuing to get paid. But Lima worries about what comes next for his family, including three children, who depend on his income. Ironworkers on the project earn about $76 an hour with pension and health benefits, typically working 84-hour weeks on four-week rotations, according to David Langlais of the Iron Workers union.

“I just came here to work for my family and I don’t really pay attention to all the political stuff,” Lima said, adding that he was confused why the White House would stop the Revolution project when it’s already 80% completed. “If the work stops and it keeps going like this, it’s going to hurt us.”

Trump has long opposed offshore wind, suing unsuccessfully before he became president to block a project within view of his golf course in Scotland. But the recent escalation of his administration’s battle against the industry risks clashing with simultaneous claims that the White House’s policies are fueling investment and job growth.

It’s simply still in development.

That’s why today I dedicate my column to sorting through Indiana’s complicated relationship with solar power—the one energy form whose costs have long been falling, whose ability to scale is rising, and the one Elon Musk constantly insists we should bet on: “Solar power is very obviously the future if you can do elementary math.”

If there were ever a time to fix our relationship, now is the time.

On one hand, Indiana has many bright spots around this evolving energy tech. In 2024, we had one of the highest state installations of solar, including finishing Phase One of Mammoth Solar—one of the nation’s largest projects. We are home to one of the nation’s relatively few made-in-America solar manufacturers, Bila Solar. Purdue University’s formidable research capacity is helping increase yields with nanophotonics and reimagining farms and solar with agrivoltaics.

Anecdotally, too, one of the few American billionaires to come out of the solar business is a son of Gary, Indiana: Dean Solon, who is now leading a charge to reinvent U.S. solar manufacturing. Former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s first move post-tenure was to join the board of a major solar company. And if you drive out of the Indianapolis airport, you’ll pass one of the largest airport solar installations in the country.

Story Continues Below

On the other hand, solar has been a political lightning rod. Year in and year out, Hoosiers from across the state band together to oppose solar and wind, obstructing legislation at the state level and projects at the county and local levels. The laws on the books tilt the scales against homeowners who want to sell homegrown rooftop solar onto the grid. Solar has become so toxic, many politicians will not touch it.

The concerns around this tech deserve clarity and space—the effects of converting farmland, the financial viability of projects, the fairness of having solar in your community—but today, I’m asking people to step back, pause and consider three big, foundational reasons to rethink solar in our current moment.

First, immediate demand spikes. In the next few years, additional energy demand can really only be met by gas, solar, wind and storage. We’re not building coal, hydro or nuclear. It would be backward not to feature solar—smartly—in that portfolio, especially given widely reported supply-chain problems for gas-plant parts.

Second, innovation. The public often underestimates the power of innovation—especially American innovation in an energy crunch. Solar and battery technologies keep improving, from inverters to better storage.

Third, China. We can’t lose the AI arms race for lack of energy. Further, China is scaling solar at breathtaking speed—projecting annual capacity additions by the end of decade that will exceed the energy the United States generates in a single year. We can’t discard this next-gen energy tech while it’s on the rise globally.

As I would with any energy source, I’m arguing for a real, honest conversation, because the stakes and potential are so high. There’s a great evolution happening in the energy and tech space, so I urge our leaders to think like clear-eyed energy strategists. Speak openly with the public about the trade-offs—as well as the promise—of this technology, and get creative with how we bring about—and where we place—this growing tech.•

Power the Future

The Center Square

In late summer 2019, an elderly woman I knew from church asked me to stop by her house in our New Mexico neighborhood. It was late August, the kind of day when the desert sun turns homes into ovens, and her air conditioner simply wouldn’t keep up. I’m no HVAC expert, but I promised to look at her thermostat.

There was no problem with the thermostat inside. The problem was on the air conditioner outside, but not a mechanical function or broken part. Her utility company installed a regulator on her A/C unit – part of a so-called “power-saving” program. The catch? During the hottest part of the day, when she needed cooling the most, the utility cut her system back. In exchange for surrendering control of her own comfort, she received a rebate of just $25 a year.

And now, instead of just controlling the A/C, some want central control of your whole thermostat.

A new bill in Ohio would allow utilities to reach into homes and directly control customer thermostats. Supporters call it “demand management.” But the reality is clear: these programs are designed to normalize energy poverty by conditioning families to accept less comfort and less freedom in exchange for pennies on the dollar.

Ohio wouldn’t be the first. In Colorado, tens of thousands of families discovered they couldn’t change their Wi-Fi enabled thermostats during a sweltering day. They were locked out – literally – because the utility had triggered a “demand response event.” One home in the program reportedly reached 88 degrees inside. Additionally, in Colorado Springs, customers are offered $50 to enroll, but the company reserves the right to raise your thermostat up to four degrees during peak demand. Sure, you can opt out – but the normalization is the point.

In Indiana, a utility pilot remotely adjusted smart thermostats to cut demand by nearly a kilowatt per home in summer. While residents technically could override, the default was no longer their choice — it was the utility’s.

Different programs, same philosophy: normalize energy scarcity by quietly taking over the devices in your home.

Policymakers and utilities always sell these schemes as “partnerships” or “innovation.” But let’s be clear: it’s not innovation to make a grandmother sit in a sweltering house because her air conditioner has been throttled. It’s not progress when families discover their thermostats are frozen on a triple-digit day. These programs shift the burden of bad energy policy onto ordinary families. Instead of building reliable power plants that keep up with demand, utilities are trained to manage shortfalls by managing you. Your thermostat, your A/C, your comfort – they become their safety valve.

This is how energy poverty is normalized. Not through rolling blackouts, but through quiet intrusions that teach us to accept less as the new normal.

Think of it this way: we would never accept Comcast taking control of our television or your internet provider cutting out news sources and social media sites. Yet, when it comes to air conditioning – the very system that keeps us safe in dangerous heat – we are told it’s normal for strangers to decide how cool our homes are allowed to be.

That double standard is alarming. The things that make life bearable in the hottest summers and coldest winters are the very things we should be protecting from outside control. The price tag for this surrender isn’t just $25 a year. It’s our autonomy. It’s the principle that our homes are our own. Every locked thermostat, every cycling A/C switch, every “demand response event” is another step toward redefining reliability downward. Comfort becomes selfish. Scarcity becomes “noble.”

That’s not noble. It’s rationing with a smartphone app. And if a utility company – or a government bureaucrat – can dictate the temperature of your living room, then your home is no longer your castle. It’s just another outpost in the grid they control.

The states with the most to lose when the EV tax credit ends

On September 30, 2025, the government’s EV tax credit expires.

For years, it’s been the magic coupon that softened the blow of sticker-shock and nudged people into electric ownership.

Now, the math gets harsher.

In 2023 alone, nearly half a million new EV buyers filed claims worth $3.3 billion, while used EV shoppers chipped in another $95.6 million.

The average payout?

Around $6,700 for a new car, $3,400 for a secondhand one.

Take that away and the buying equation shifts dramatically.

No state has more at stake than California.

If the program disappears, its drivers lose out on roughly $1.1 billion in incentives.

Texas follows with just under $273 million, then Florida with about $201 million.

On the opposite end sits Mississippi, North Dakota, and Louisiana, where EV credits barely made a dent in the first place.

For automakers, that’s a patchwork market.

Hot zones are suddenly cooling, while slow states will stay slow.

And the trend was already wobbly.

Nationwide EV registrations grew to 1.7 percent of all light-duty vehicles in 2023, up from 1.2 percent the year before.

But sales of new EVs actually dipped 6.3 percent in Q2 this year compared with last.

Removing the credit risks pouring cold water on an already lukewarm market.

What this means for the electric car market

Nationwide, EVs are still only a sliver of the market.

Just 1.7 percent of light-duty vehicles on US roads in 2023 were electric, even after the tax credit helped thousands of buyers.

And in Q2 2025, new EV sales actually slipped 6.3 percent compared with the same period last year.

LendingTree’s analysis warns that removing the federal incentive could slow demand even further.

Especially in states without strong local programs or charging infrastructure to pick up the slack.

That means fewer people crossing the line into EV ownership, and a tougher job for automakers already facing softer sales.

For buyers, the next couple of weeks may be one of the last chances to claim the maximum credit.

But so far, some Republican committee chairs appear skeptical that the opportunity even exists. And even if a second reconciliation bill does come together eventually, key players in Congress are indicating that energy and environment provisions may be off the table.

“I feel like the things that we could do within the parameters of reconciliation we exhausted,” said House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), speaking specifically about energy provisions.

He said Republicans “had so many wins” in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that it’s unclear “if there’s any meat left on the bone with respect to more pro-energy policies.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has announced plans to take a second stab at a party-line reconciliation bill this fall, and some of the planning has already begun.

A House GOP working group has kicked off discussions, and some members have laid down markers for provisions they want to pursue, including regulatory overhauls and fees on electric vehicles.

Still, those efforts have been slow to gain steam, and they face major headwinds with lawmakers suggesting there is little desire for chasing more energy and climate policies.

The relative dearth of activity thus far is in part a reflection of the comprehensive haul Republicans secured in the multitrillion-dollar party-line bill they passed in July. It checked most of the GOP’s boxes — repealing clean energy tax credits, rescinding billions of dollars for climate grants, rolling back emissions rules, and creating incentives for fossil fuel drilling and mining, among other provisions.

Republicans’ apparent hesitance to pursue even more energy provisions also signals a weariness among members to go through the kinds of intense intraparty negotiations they endured just a few months ago.

“It seems to me that the appetite for anything reconciliation right now, understandably, is, ‘God, please don’t,’” said Heather Reams, president of the right-leaning advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions.

The White House and congressional leaders have yet to outline specific priorities for a second bill, and some lawmakers have thrown cold water on the idea of it coming together at all, with some warning it could actually be counterproductive.

“I think that’s going to be interesting if it develops,” said Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). “It’s not developing now.”

The vision for the second bill, according to Johnson, Arrington and other GOP leaders, is a much smaller package that would contain budget policies that Republicans did not get to the first time or that they were forced to abandon because of parliamentary issues.

But conservative lawmakers, advocates and lobbyists say they are generally satisfied with what they got out of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And some of the language that dropped out of the original bill may not be revived — including related to permitting and regulations — because it still would not comply with the Senate’s strict reconciliation rules.

The allure of budget reconciliation process is that it allows fiscal legislation to pass by simple majority. The downside is the restrictions.

Democrats will have little power to stop the bill since they are in the minority. But like last time, they could request parliamentary inquiries to tank provisions that violate the Senate’s budget rules.

Democrats are also likely to continue to amplify their messaging that Republican-favored energy policies will increase Americans’ electricity bills.

“Instead of helping families, Republicans are ripping away the cheapest forms of power we have, driving up costs, killing jobs, and handing another gift to Big Oil & Gas,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News.

“Now they want a sequel?” Schumer said. “American families can’t afford an encore of Republicans’ Big Beautiful Blunder.”

Mixed signals

Republicans appear to be in vastly different places in the planning process, creating a split-screen dynamic between members who are forging ahead and others who say discussions have not yet begun.

On one side of the spectrum is the Republican Study Committee — the House’s conservative policy forum — which has set up a “Reconciliation 2.0 Working Group.” They plan to unveil a broad policy framework for the reconciliation package as soon as this week, said Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas), chair of the RSC.

The group held multiple brainstorming and informational sessions with congressional staffers and advocacy groups over the summer. In early August, aides were invited to hear from staff on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, POLITICO reported.

“We’ve passed a very successful first bill. Now, what kinds of provisions can we look forward to?” Pfluger said, describing the RSC’s thinking without providing specifics. “How can we work with our Senate counterparts to move the ball a little bit more forward on some of the issues that have been hampering energy production?”

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) has been saying for months that he has been talking to members and staff to get the ball rolling.

“Those discussions are happening, and I think it could happen,” Westerman said recently. “I can tell you we’re working on it.”

But on the other end of the spectrum, some Republican committee chairs say they have not seen any movement or begun conversations of their own, despite Johnson’s publicly stated plans for a second bill.

House Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) said, “I know that people are talking reconciliation, but I haven’t — we haven’t — sat down and started putting any plans together.”

Capito, the EPW chair, noted that a reconciliation bill is “not developing now” because “there’s just too many other things that are taking precedence.”

Congress has been busy with fights over nominees and fiscal 2026 appropriations bills. Controversies around the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, partisan rescissions packages and other issues have also taken up significant floor time.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, declined to comment.

Spokespeople for the White House and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Johnson referred E&E News to the speaker’s previous public statements.

Johnson told Bloomberg in July that his goal was to produce a smaller reconciliation bill in the “late fall.” He said it would probably involve just four or five committees, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.

Keeping the door open

The lack of visible action on a second reconciliation bill does not necessarily spell doom for the effort. Some Republican lawmakers and lobbyists are waiting in the wings, eager to pitch in when the time is right.

“Undoubtedly, if there was another bill, we would certainly take the opportunity to try to do better on renewable energy and try another path,” said Reams, of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, which supports renewables as part of a balanced energy strategy.

“It may be futile to do that,” she said, “but if there’s an opportunity and the doors open, we would take that opportunity.”

Luke Bolar, chief external affairs officer at the conservative energy nonprofit ClearPath, said that while most of the group’s top priorities were taken care of in the first bill, the advanced manufacturing production tax credit known as 45X “might be one to relook at.”

“They did include some provisions that will be good for critical minerals, which is positive,” Bolar said, “but I think there are other American advanced manufacturing technologies that could benefit from the 45X credit,” including for grid components such as transformers and conductors.

Lee and Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) want to revive their sweeping regulatory overhaul bill — a version of the “Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act” — which the parliamentarian said ran afoul of Senate reconciliation rules. The provision would have expanded congressional veto power over certain agency rulemakings.

“I feel like, had we had more time, we could have worked out some of the bugs on [‘REINS’],” Lee said after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed without his preferred language. “Even that adverse parliamentarian ruling is one that I think we could work through. That’s a potential option.”

Guthrie, who said his committee has not started putting together ideas, hinted before the August recess that artificial intelligence policy could be a priority for the Republican majority this Congress. The energy demands of the rapidly advancing technology could be at the center of upcoming conversations, he said.

“Everybody you meet with [on] AI business says, ‘Energy energy, energy,’” Guthrie told reporters. “They’ve got the brain power, they’ve got the capital, and they need energy. So that’s what we have to focus on.”

Doubts remain

While lawmakers and advocates have sporadically floated various ideas for “reconciliation 2.0,” the effort still faces obstacles.

Mustering the political will for more party-line energy provisions could prove exceedingly difficult, especially since many members and lobbyists feel satisfied with the results of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“We’re talking about a second bill,” said Westerman, “but, you know, we got a lot of stuff in the first bill.”

Kristin Whitman, senior vice president of federal relations at the American Petroleum Institute — the oil and gas industry’s loudest voice on Capitol Hill — praised the first reconciliation bill in a statement but indicated that the group is now focused on permitting reform, which is likely to be acted on outside of reconciliation.

Capito and House Transportation and Infrastructure Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.) have said they would want to revive a proposal to impose registration fees on hybrid and electric vehicles in order to shore up the Highway Trust Fund, which relies heavily on gasoline taxes.

But that language, promoted by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), was dropped from the first bill because the fee structure was too difficult to enforce as written at the time.

Asked recently whether he would want to bring it back in the next budget bill, Moreno demurred.

“Not EVs,” he said. “I think that’s settled.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6a/38/3ef8bf724ee08b2e333e28b349f9/u-s-congress-84881.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:47.806177

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

What are the incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

When homeowners decide to go solar, many assume the process is as simple as choosing a provider and scheduling an installation. In reality, there is a common obstacle that can stop projects before they begin: the roof. If the roof is old, damaged, or nearing the end of its lifespan, most installers will not move forward until it is replaced.

More solar providers are now moving toward integrated roofing and solar services to reduce delays and cut costs. Purelight Power, which operates across the Pacific Northwest and is expanding into California, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, is one of several companies betting that this bundled approach could become the new standard in home energy.

The Problem with Separate Contractors

For decades, roofing and solar were handled by different trades. A homeowner might sign a contract for solar panels, only to discover later that their roof could not support the system.

""It is one of the biggest frustrations we hear from homeowners,"" says Josh Hoeg of Purelight Power. ""They are excited about solar, but they end up facing an unexpected roof replacement before they can move forward.""

Hiring a roofer separately often adds months to the project. It also creates warranty headaches: if a leak develops later, the roofer and solar installer may blame one another, leaving the homeowner stuck in the middle.

The Rise of Integrated Solar and Roofing

This gap in the market has led to a growing trend: companies offering integrated solar and roofing solutions. Homeowners can now replace their roof and install panels through a single provider, rather than juggling two contractors.

The benefits are clear:

One point of contact. No need to manage multiple companies.

Unified warranties. A single provider takes responsibility for both the roof and the panels.

Simplified financing. Roofing costs can often be bundled into solar loans, and in some cases may even qualify for tax incentives.

Purelight has already expanded its roofing services in Oregon, including Portland and Bend, where demand for combined projects is strong. ""By combining services, we are removing one of the biggest barriers to going solar,"" adds [Executive Name]. ""When homeowners can solve two problems with one investment, adoption goes up dramatically.""

Why It Matters for Homeowners

Bundling a roof replacement with a solar installation is not just about convenience; it can also deliver long-term savings. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the average residential solar system costs between $15,000 and $25,000, while a new roof ranges from $10,000 to $15,000. When handled separately, these projects often require different loans with different terms.

Doing them together allows some providers to fold both projects into a single financing plan. The Solar Energy Industries Association notes that portions of the roof replacement that directly support the solar system may qualify for federal tax credits, lowering costs by thousands of dollars.

There is also a practical advantage. A new roof can last 25 to 30 years, roughly the same lifespan as most solar panels. Aligning the two investments helps ensure the solar system produces consistently without major interruptions.

Industry Perspectives

Analysts are paying attention. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has identified ""roof readiness"" as one of the most common barriers for homeowners considering solar. That has made integrated services an attractive option as adoption continues to rise.

Purelight Power is not the only company moving in this direction, but it has been among the early adopters in the Pacific Northwest. The company recently earned recognition as a Best of Bend award winner for solar, placing second in the category. The award highlights how local communities are responding to providers that simplify the process and reduce barriers for homeowners.

""Energy is changing faster than most homeowners realize,"" says Josh Hoeg. ""In the next decade, we believe solar will be as standard as air conditioning, and integrating roofing is part of making that future practical and affordable.""

Looking Ahead

As more states introduce incentives and homeowners look for ways to lower energy bills, pairing solar with roofing may soon become the default option. For homeowners, the shift promises fewer surprises, stronger warranties, and more predictable savings.

Going solar has always been about more than clean energy. It is also about making a smart, lasting investment in the home. With roofing and solar increasingly handled together, that investment is becoming much easier to manage.",https://d.techtimes.com/en/full/459331/pairing-solar-roofing.png,N,,2025-09-19 14:06:50.339013

However, Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.) said in a markup earlier this year that the bill would allow “fossil fuel projects to cut the line.”

“We shouldn’t be prioritizing ready-to-go projects just because they are clean energy,” he said.

The bill is unlikely to pass in the Senate, where it would need at least seven Democrats to support it.

The Trump administration wants to roll back the 2009 endangerment finding, which determined that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases threaten human health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act.

Because the endangerment finding forms the basis for so many other rules, some conservatives have seen rolling it back as a way to knock down multiple climate regulations at once. Announcing plans to revoke the finding in July, Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, called it “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

One of the Trump administration’s arguments to repeal the endangerment finding amounts to an assertion that the science has changed since 2009, and the evidence no longer supports the conclusions that underpin rules limiting emissions from cars and power plants.

According to DoE analysis, the current pace of project development is insufficient to support the rapidly growing manufacturing base and ongoing reindustrialisation.

Through this initiative, the department will work with stakeholders to identify grid projects capable of power delivery, while addressing the grid’s complex challenges.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said: “In the coming years, Americans will require more energy to power their homes and businesses – and with President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is ensuring we can meet this growing demand while fuelling AI and data centre development with affordable, reliable and secure sources.

“With the Speed to Power initiative, we are leveraging the expertise of the private sector to harness all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race.”

To begin with, the DoE is issuing a request for information to gather input on large-scale grid infrastructure projects, including both generation and transmission.

The initiative builds on President Trump’s Executive Order declaring a National Energy Emergency, signed on his first day in office, which emphasised the urgent need to expand US energy infrastructure for national and economic security.

In line with this order, the DoE released the report evaluating US grid reliability and security, which provides a uniform methodology to identify at-risk regions and guide federal interventions around reliability.

But whatever Congress decides on the EPA budget, state environment departments next year will still receive substantially less federal support for their work.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Every dollar that the federal government directs to state environment departments enables the Great Lakes and every other region to steward natural resources, yielding many times the value of the federal contribution. State environment departments make the case daily that they merit more financial support, not less.

That is why Circle of Blue’s opinion desk has been worried for months about the dangerous consequences of President Trump’s proposal to rip $5 billion – 55 percent – out of the Environmental Protection Agency’s $9.1 billion budget.

Now that it’s September, we’re encouraged (just a tiny bit, mind you) by the actions MAGA Republicans in both houses of Congress have taken to break with the president to reduce the size of the proposed EPA budget reduction.

The Republican-led House proposes a less absurd but still dire 26 percent cut for the EPA. The Senate wants to shave a more reasonable 6 percent out of the environmental agency’s 2026 budget. Lawmakers from both chambers are meeting to reach a compromise in time to add the EPA provisions to a final federal budget bill by the end of the month to avoid a government shutdown.

Both proposals are a visible and aggressive rebuke of Trump at the federal level that attracted scant comment in the capital. That doesn’t mean, though, that we’re anywhere close to being relieved. Here’s why. Most of the work – 90 percent, in fact – of meeting the goals of federal statutes to safely manage air, water, wildlife habitat, and toxic substances is carried out by state environment and natural resources departments. And sizable portions of every state’s environment budget are funded by the EPA.

For instance, the Illinois EPA receives $1 billion of its $1.3 billion budget from U.S. EPA funds. Similarly, Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) receives 52 percent of its $1.2 billion annual budget from federal revenue.

The Environmental Management Division of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources gains a quarter of the funding for its air quality program from the U.S. EPA. Almost all of the $34.3 million Ohio EPA budget for protecting water quality is funded by the U.S. EPA.

State authorities insist they will manage with what they have. “EGLE continues to keep an eye on federal actions and potential actions,” said Dale George, the department’s communications director, in an email message. “We’re not letting uncertainty shift the focus from our statutory functions protecting Michigan’s environment and public health.”

State Departments Will Have Less Money

EGLE employs 1,500 full-time staff members, and judging from the generally first-class condition of Michigan’s waters, forests, shorelines, and streams, the agency is holding its own. But the loss of tens of millions of federal dollars in the environmental protection programs in Michigan and every other state seriously diminishes their capacity.

The reason: responsibilities of state environment agencies are extensive, expensive, and – with the exception of major mistakes – generally out of public sight. They encompass such tasks as deciding permit conditions for new commercial and industrial developments. They monitor the quality of streams and the safety of drinking water. They ensure that toxic cleanups, mining, and oil and gas production are done safely. And they prosecute violations.

State environment departments also are responsible for administering their portion of the more than $4 billion from the EPA that is available to local governments for modernizing drinking water infrastructure and preventing water pollution. President Trump proposed to cut most of the funding for this low-interest loan and grant program. The House is eyeing a 24 percent cut, while the Senate wants to maintain current funding levels.

To everyday Americans that may appear to be tussling around big dollars. In government terms, it’s not. Environment department budgets typically are a fraction – 1 to 3 percent – of total state budgets. The U.S. EPA budget is less than two-tenths of 1 percent of this year’s $6.8 trillion federal budget.

At that level the president’s assertion that cutting the EPA budget will reduce the federal deficit is absurd. The deficit has grown even as states have steadily lost federal support for their core environmental programs for over two decades.

EPA funding in 2025 for what the agency calls “categorical” grants for air and water quality, pollution prevention, toxic waste management, and 18 other core programs was $1 billion. In 2003, the budget for categorical grants was $1.14 billion, which in real dollar terms, accounting for inflation, is equal to $2 billion today.

In other words, states lost half of their federal funding in 22 years for the day-to-day work they do to protect the environment.

President Trump proposed earlier this year to eliminate 19 of the 22 categorical grants. Congress appears ready to reject those cuts, too.

That’s a relief. In 1964 the Wilderness Act was enacted to block development in the country’s wildest public lands. In the next 16 years the United States embarked on a profoundly important and successful era of national environmental policy to limit damage to air, water, habitat, and people that culminated in 1980 with the federal Superfund law to clean up toxic wastes. Almost every one of the environmental statutes relied on the concept of cooperation between the federal and state governments.

The federal government established the basic framework and goals. The EPA provided financial support to reach them. State and local agencies agreed to be directly responsible for implementation and enforcement.

Breaking Cooperation?

President Trump proposed in his 2026 budget plan to wreck that relationship. Even reactionaries in Congress rejected the most extreme version of Trump’s gambit.

But whatever Congress decides on the EPA budget, state environment departments next year will still receive substantially less federal support for their work. Every state will feel the consequences. Erosion in the quality of a state’s natural abundance, and its accessibility, weakens the quality of life and the condition of the economy.

Less money limits state oversight of polluters and law breakers. It will slow administrative functions, like reviewing and issuing new air, water quality, and operating permits. These delays aggravate business and factory owners. It could cause employers to lay off staff and abandon their projects.

Michigan, my home state, is rich now in clean water, clean air, unspoiled shorelines and Lake Michigan sand dunes, ample freshwater fisheries, and millions of acres of public forest accessible by hundreds of trails.

It’s a legacy of effective environmentalism that supports abundant wildlife, a robust economy, a reliably excellent experience for millions of faithfully returning visitors, and life-in-balance for the people of this beautiful state. I dread to think how serious reductions in federal support will spoil what the state environment agency has accomplished over the last half century.

Veloz, a national nonpartisan 501(c)(3) nonprofit, leads the charge in electric vehicle (EV) education through its “The Way Forward is Electric” initiative under the Electric For All program. This brand-neutral campaign educates consumers on EV benefits amid surging sales, reaching hundreds of millions nationwide in its first two months. Launched on July 1, the effort emphasizes cost savings, lower maintenance, charging ease, and ample range, adapting swiftly to policy shifts like the early end of federal EV tax credits.

Key Highlights

425.5 million paid media impressions generated since launch, driving widespread awareness.

Over 990,000 website visits to ElectricForAll.org, with 220,000+ accessing incentive resources.

Campaign pivots to inform on qualifying for tax credits via contracts and down payments by September 30, despite possession delays.

EV sales hit a record 146,332 units in August, with projections for the highest quarterly total in U.S. history.

Supported by $43.5 million from Electrify America and partners like automakers, utilities, and nonprofits.

The campaign’s agility shines in its response to congressional changes ending the federal EV tax credit ahead of schedule. Veloz updated messaging to guide consumers toward ElectricForAll.org, a multilingual hub in 15 languages, including English and Spanish. This resource simplifies finding federal, state, and local incentives by ZIP code, comparing new and used EVs, locating charging stations, and calculating gas and maintenance savings. It equips drivers with tools for long-term affordability, addressing concerns like charging access and post-incentive costs.

Josh D. Boone, Executive Director of Veloz, highlights the focus on financial perks. “Americans are deeply concerned about the cost of living right now,” Boone states. “So, we’re focusing on the financial benefits of EVs through both short-term incentives and long-term savings.” This research-driven approach counters misinformation, fostering confidence in EV ownership.

Engagement metrics underscore the campaign’s impact. Consumers from states like Texas, Florida, California, Georgia, Washington, and New York flock to the site for answers to key questions: Where to charge? How much to save? What follows federal incentives? Automaker data reflects this momentum—General Motors achieved its best-ever month with over 21,000 EVs sold in August, while Ford saw a nearly 19% sales jump from July as buyers hurried for the $7,500 credit.

Boone emphasizes sustained growth: “Just because the federal incentives are sunsetting doesn’t mean EV adoption will stall.” The initiative builds momentum beyond policies, uniting industry, advocacy, and policy experts. With broad collaboration, it positions Veloz as the architect of the nation’s largest EV public awareness effort.

Founded in 2017 on the California Plug-In Electric Vehicle Collaborative’s legacy, Veloz convenes diverse stakeholders for innovative programming and events. The Electric For All program, powered by Veloz, streamlines the switch to electric transport, making it accessible for all communities. By sparking interest and providing clear information, the campaign ensures EV adoption thrives, even as incentives evolve.

This collaborative model proves powerful. “Working with industry, policy, and advocacy experts, we’ve shown that when the EV industry comes together, we can build momentum that lasts beyond a single policy or incentive,” Boone concludes. As EV interest surges this quarter, Veloz’s efforts cut through noise, empowering informed choices and driving record engagement at a pivotal moment.",https://theevreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Electric-For-All.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:08.119566

I read about it in “My Weekly Reader,” (a popular educational newspaper for schoolchildren in those days) and discussed it with my teacher. She was the same teacher who advised us not to ride gas-operated mini-bikes as it was harmful to the environment.

It was an exciting time to come of age. Environmental awareness had creeped into the American consciousness. It was a time when a river in Ohio made international news by catching on fire and our cities were experiencing the choking haze of worsening air pollution. People just knew something had to be done about it.

That first Earth Day was universally celebrated by both political parties. It was that same year that then-President Richard Nixon (a Republican) signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

It is impossible to talk about that First Earth Day, and what the distinguished author Douglas Brinkley calls the “Silent Spring Revolution… and the Great Environmental Awakening” without first mentioning a fearless and courageous woman, Rachel Carson.

Rachel Carson’s watershed book “Silent Spring” was published in 1962 and is often credited as the linchpin to the modern environmental movement. In the book, Carson warns of the dangers of widespread use of DDT and other pesticides. Of course, she was viciously attacked by the chemical industry.

When Nixon created the EPA by executive order in 1970, it was in response to this rising environmentalism and was almost immediately effective in setting about to reduce pollution. State and municipal governments soon followed suit. These ideas were not radical. They were about protecting the commons, the air that we breathe and the water that we drink. Today, I feel as though the EPA is retreating from these important accomplishments. One step up and two steps back, it would appear.

Last month, the EPA published its repeal of the Endangerment Finding, which provides the legal underpinning for limiting greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from cars and other sources. The EPA administrator said, “Today marks the death of the Green New Scam.” I think we need to be careful about oversimplification and sloganeering. It was the EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act which established standards for limiting the amount of lead in gasoline and other emissions, including carbon monoxide. I remember filling my motorcycle up with leaded gasoline when I was in high school. Leaded gasoline was extremely harmful, especially to children. Years later, during port calls in developing countries, I could personally witness the harmful effects to people in places that did not have these same protections and regulations. It took decades to phase out the use of leaded gasoline. How long will it take us to recover from misguided actions we might be undertaking today?

As of this writing, there is still a chance to provide public comment to the EPA regarding the Endangerment Finding on their website. I encourage individual citizens to do so. I am a sailor, not a scientist, but it just makes sense to protect humanity and all living things on this rapidly warming planet. Undoing the regulatory framework that Nixon put in place in 1970, over a half a century ago, is misguided. Touch gently the earth our children and grandchildren rest upon.

Stevenson, Carlos Anchondo, Jennifer Yachnin, Heather Richards, Scott Streater",,,,,https://www.eenews.net/articles/burgum-celebrated-wind-power-then-trump-tapped-him-to-kill-it/,"During his eight years in office, wind power flourished in his home state — so much so that Burgum honored wind power last year as part of a weeklong celebration for clean energy.
“Wind power provided about one-third of North Dakota’s net generation in 2022,” Burgum bragged in his September 2024 proclamation.
“He knew that wind power was one of those important features to reach that goal.” But now, Ista says he fears for workers in his district — which includes the city of Grand Forks — who work at a wind turbine manufacturing plant, LM Wind Power.

North Dakota is a natural source for wind because it has “substantial and nearly continuous wind energy resources,” according to the EIA.","Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has taken a wrecking ball to the U.S. wind industry since joining the Trump administration earlier this year.

But it hasn’t always been that way.

In just seven months at Interior, Burgum has blocked or stalled at least six major wind projects, including one off the coast of New England that’s 80 percent complete. At the same time, Burgum has cast doubt on the reliability of wind power, telling CNBC last week that “you don’t know when the wind’s gonna blow.”

Yet Burgum’s recent turn as wind power nemesis stands in contrast to how he viewed the energy source during his time as North Dakota governor. During his eight years in office, wind power flourished in his home state — so much so that Burgum honored wind power last year as part of a weeklong celebration for clean energy.

“Wind power provided about one-third of North Dakota’s net generation in 2022,” Burgum bragged in his September 2024 proclamation. That put North Dakota “among the top six states with the largest share of electricity generated by wind.”

That’s not all.

In 2021, he called on his state to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. It’s an aggressive timeline, but Burgum said North Dakota is uniquely positioned to hit that mark because it boasts enough underground storage space to store “4,400 years’ worth of the state’s carbon output,” according to the governor’s office.

“We can reach carbon neutrality in the state of North Dakota by 2030 without a single mandate, without any additional regulation,” Burgum said in 2021. “We can get there just through the innovation and the different geology that we have.”

An Interior Department spokesperson did not directly answer questions as to why Burgum’s position on wind had changed so significantly in the last year but issued a statement that attacked the “Radical Green New Scam” and promoted fossil fuel generation.

“Secretary Burgum is in agreement with President Donald Trump that protecting our energy security means ensuring the American people aren’t reliant on designed to fail energy sources, such as wind, which is why the Department of the Interior recently ended special treatment for these unreliable energy sources,” Aubrie Spady said in a statement.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly added that Burgum has “long aligned with the President’s agenda to Make America Energy Dominant Again, largely through prioritizing fossil fuel-generated energy.”

To be sure, Burgum was a big booster for fossil fuels when he was governor — which makes sense given North Dakota’s wealth of oil, gas and coal reserves. But it was part of a broader “all-of-the-above” energy policy that one North Dakota Democrat says he no longer recognizes.

Burgum “went out ahead of his fellow Republican governors and it put us on a path towards carbon neutrality in an aggressive time frame,” said state Rep. Zachary Ista. “He knew that wind power was one of those important features to reach that goal.”

But now, Ista says he fears for workers in his district — which includes the city of Grand Forks — who work at a wind turbine manufacturing plant, LM Wind Power. “Their jobs are the ones that are getting played, they’re having politics played with them,” said Ista, who serves as minority leader in the North Dakota state house.

When he was first elected in 2016, Burgum was a moderate who avoided culture wars and did not seek to block renewable energy, said Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, a conservation group that advocates for clean energy.

In fact, Burgum as governor did not back a GOP-led effort in the state legislature to ban wind turbines, Skokos noted.

“A lot of people are very confused about what happened to Doug Burgum,” Skokos said. “People kind of think of Doug as something like two different people. There is Doug Burgum pre-presidential run, and then there’s Doug now.”

Burgum briefly sought the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

As Interior secretary, Burgum has been aggressive in his attacks on wind generation. In Europe last week, he said there was “not a future for offshore wind” in the Trump administration.

Last month, as part of its ongoing efforts to throttle clean energy projects, the Interior Department issued an order that made clear it would now consider as a factor the amount of space a proposed project takes up compared to other energy sources. That’s a directive aimed at wind projects, which can require more acreage than oil and gas drilling.

Burgum again repeated his newfound worries about wind energy, claiming it was “unreliable.”

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Burgum said in a statement.

Under Burgum, the Interior Department has proposed revoking the permits for at least three offshore wind projects in the Atlantic, canceled approvals for a massive onshore wind project in Idaho and issued a stop-work order on an offshore wind project that is 80 percent complete. Interior also issued a stop-work order on a New York wind project, but later lifted it.

Additionally, the Interior Department is working to slow additional wind projects by exploring their impact on migratory birds, eliminating policies “biased in favor of wind and solar energy” and weighing whether to remove areas onshore and offshore for wind energy development.

Burgum’s recent attacks on wind energy are notable too given how much the power source has helped his home state. During Burgum’s tenure as governor, from 2016 to 2024, wind power generation more than doubled in North Dakota, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

North Dakota is a natural source for wind because it has “substantial and nearly continuous wind energy resources,” according to the EIA. That natural advantage helps explain why North Dakota has more than 4,000 megawatts of installed wind power generating capacity and four of its top 10 power plants by generation are powered by wind.

That takes on extra significance because North Dakota is ranked third among states — behind only Texas and New Mexico — for crude oil reserves and production. And yet, the state’s electricity generation mix is about 40 percent clean energy, including wind at 35 percent and hydropower at 5 percent, according to EIA data from 2024.

The first elected office Burgum held was North Dakota governor, so he started running the state like a CEO of company who recognized the value in all forms of energy production, said Heather Reams, CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative clean energy advocacy group.

He had a “problem-solving mindset” and clearly saw the value in wind because North Dakota had so much energy potential, she said.

“He was looking at the balance sheet more than anything, I think that was his motivation, rather than anything political because he didn’t come from politics, doesn’t have that background,” Reams said. “You can see how he operated much more as a more like, a CEO, an innovative thinker, out of the box thinker.”

That has certainly changed now that Burgum is leading Trump’s anti-wind crusade, but Reams said it seems like Burgum is just following the president’s priorities rather than relying on his own experience as governor of a wind-intensive state.

Whatever Burgum may profess to believe now, investors don’t seem to buy in when it comes to clean energy in the state he once led, said Skokos, of the Dakota Resource Council.

“Clearly North Dakota doesn’t agree with Doug because we rely on so much wind power,” he said. “And clearly wind is reliable in North Dakota because people keep investing in it.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/0c/4b/175a2c694b718612dc26ffbc4185/election-2024-burgum-05788.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 07:58:46.292005

Aspects of this different approach to security are considered in the Dashboard with a number of SMR design incorporating ‘security by design’ into the SMR design.","The global appetite for energy, in particular electricity, is insatiable. Our demand for electrification is driven to a significant extent by our digital lives, underpinned by the rapid roll-out of data centres, new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), as well as the electrification of mobility (EVs) and increased demand for heat and cooling. In a February 2025 report, the International Energy Agency's (IEA) director, Keisuke Sadamori stated:

“The acceleration of global electricity demand highlights the significant changes taking place in energy systems around the world and the approach of a new Age of Electricity. But it also presents evolving challenges for governments in ensuring secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply, … While emerging and developing economies are set to drive the large majority of the growth in global electricity demand in the coming years, consumption is also expected to increase in many advanced economies after a period of relative stagnation.”

As the world is looking beyond traditional fossil-fuel based energy sources, nuclear is emerging as the source of long term, low carbon and efficient electricity supply. When people think of nuclear power, they likely think of the huge nuclear power plants in Europe, Asia, and North America. These grid scale plants typically start at 1 GW and up, take many years to plan, permit and build and come at significant cost, generally in the billions. However, small modular reactors (SMRs) (typically reactors that produce 300MW or less though some designs are closer to 500MW) are emerging as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative.

Many countries are developing SMRs with over 120 different designs under active development. Such countries include the US, UK, France, Canada, Korea, Czech Republic, Poland, Finland, UAE, Switzerland, Netherlands, and South Africa. With such interest and investment, SMRs are expected to play an important role in future energy markets.

In July 2025, the Nuclear Energy Agency – a part of the OECD – published its third edition of the Small Modular Reactor Dashboard (the Dashboard)1 which sets out the current state of play of SMRs across the globe. It identifies a surge in designs, financing, and regulatory engagement relating to SMRs. This article will look at some of the findings of the Dashboard including the key benefits of SMRs and considerations around their licensing in addition to other key issues, including financing, security and the need for public engagement.

SMRs – a catch-all solution to the energy crisis?

The IEA predicts that global energy demand will grow 4% per year between now and 2027. Current energy grids and traditional fuel sources will struggle by themselves to meet this demand. Renewables alone cannot supply this level of demand without significant and costly investment in energy storage solutions and grid enhancement. Also, renewables typically take up significant land resources. As a result, many countries are looking to SMRs as a possible solution to provide base load, low carbon power within a geographically small area (essentially providing high density power compared to renewables' low density). The Dashboard shows that over 30 countries are now in various stages of developing their first commercial nuclear power project – many of these will be SMRs.

Small and modular design

SMR designs look to utilise factory manufacturing and a modular construction process, where quality assurance and testing can take place during the manufacturing stage, with construction timescales reduced and transportation to the customer site simplified.

The 120 (and counting) SMR designs being developed around the world, target varied outputs and different applications, such as electricity, hybrid energy systems, heating, water desalinisation and steam for industrial applications.

There is no single ""standard"" SMR design, but rather a category of nuclear reactors defined by their output and modular, factory-fabricated construction. While designs vary, prevalent technologies include pressurized water reactors (PWRs). These are essentially scaled down versions of the grid scale plants. Other types of SMR are also being developed including high-temperature gas reactors, pebble-bed, thorium and molten salt reactors.

Advanced SMR refers to SMRs that incorporate innovative technologies and designs to enhance safety, flexibility, and affordability compared to conventional nuclear power plants. These reactor designs are often smaller again than SMRs, factory-built for modular installation, and can leverage passive safety features and various technologies beyond traditional light-water designs, offering new applications for electricity, heat, and clean fuels. In addition to SMRs, there is a renewed interest in micro-reactors which have a capacity of 1 – 20MW, as opposed to the 200 – 500MW for SMRs. The Dashboard helpfully provides a collection of leading examples of SMRs under design, as well as some micro-reactors.

Use cases

SMRs offer a new universe of opportunity for nuclear, with multiple potential use cases. For example, BIG TECH are increasingly turning to nuclear sources of energy to supply the electricity used by the huge hyperscale data centres that drive AI (and intended to accommodate the planned growth in quantum-computing), resulting in Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple all having now made significant investments into the nuclear sector. This is because AI data centres need large amounts of electricity to both power them and keep equipment cool, and access to power has become a critical factor in driving new data centre builds. Importantly, nuclear power, which can provide firm baseload low carbon power 24 hours a day, has become increasingly attractive to the tech industry as it attempts to cut emissions even as they use more energy.

Another potential SMR use case is nuclear maritime, as around 90% of global trade transported by sea, shipping accounts for nearly 3% of worldwide emissions. The IMO is in the process of establishing a new greenhouse gas strategy aiming for zero emissions by 2050, which includes a target for sustainable fuels to represent 10% of energy usage in maritime transport by 2030. Nuclear energy (with naval nuclear propulsion successfully deployed for decades, with 160 ships being powered by small nuclear reactors – essentially pre-cursers to the modern civil SMRs being planned today) is increasingly gaining traction in the energy transition, as a potential solution for lowering emissions from international maritime shipping. Regulatory challenges remain with respect to maritime nuclear, with a lack of IMO or other regulation. Land base uses of SMR will take priority in the medium term.

Licensing

While the nuclear industry across jurisdictions is heavily regulated, this regulation has been focused on medium and large 'traditional' nuclear power plants. Applying the same regulatory approach to SMRs would unnecessarily constrain and delay their deployment. Given their modularity, technical design (including inherent safety features) and scalability, the regulation of SMRs will require a different approach to traditional nuclear power plants. Crucially, while traditional nuclear power plants are bespoke, often taking many decades to transition through the design phase, to the regulatory approval stage, to construction and completion, given the relative size of SMRs, they will be able to be constructed quickly by comparison once initial design approval is given to the particular SMR model and the industry is tooled accordingly.

While approving the first SMR in a given country will be the largest hurdle - that is other than China and Russia, which collectively already have three domestic designed SMRs in operation, once the first SMR is completed (the first-of-a-kind), obtaining approval for the following SMRs (the 'Nth-of-a-kind') should be much more straightforward. Given their small size and modularity, regulators can approve standard designs for each module, which will improve efficiency. In theory, a design for a module only needs to be approved once, following which compliant designs can be rolled out without the need for additional certification.

One option could be to foster international collaboration between national nuclear regulators, so that ‘badge of origins’ can be utilised with regulators having the ability to passport designs into their own regulatory framework based on this badge of origin from another regulator. There are now encouraging signs that international collaboration between nuclear regulators is indeed increasing, driven by new nuclear technologies (primarily SMRs and advanced micro-reactor SMRs) and the need for more aligned regulatory approaches to ensure global safety and facilitate deployment. In September 2025 the UK and the USA announced the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy. The partnership will fast-track reactor design reviews, meaning that if a reactor design passed rigorous safety checks in one country, this work can be used by the other to supports its assessment, avoiding duplication of work. This is expected to speed up the licensing process.

In addition to the UK-USA partnership other initiatives include the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Regulatory Cooperation Forum, formal Information Exchange Arrangements for bilateral agreements, and trilateral Memoranda of Cooperation on specific technologies like AI. This collaboration aims to share knowledge, align standards, and streamline regulatory processes, creating efficiency and ensuring consistently high safety levels across different countries.

When dealing with any nuclear substance, safety is paramount. Regulators need to be sure that what they are approving is safe to operate, particularly given SMRs are likely to be situated much closer to and within business districts and even residential areas. Given their compact size, there will be much less reliance on active safety systems (like pumps and valves) and instead more reliance on passive safety systems (such as natural circulation and the use of gravity to assist draining and water movement). However, the whole safety apparatus around SMRs will be on a much-reduced scale from traditional nuclear power plants.

Site approvals

While regulatory approval of design may be passported from one country to another, approval of the installation of a particular SMR design to a specific site will remain the concern of the national nuclear regulator. Regulators will need to take into consideration the unique factors of each site, which will vary greatly between, for example, those in rural areas vis-à-vis those located in a central business district. Much like the ownership of SMRs themselves, siting is going to involve a mix of public and private entities. The Dashboard highlights that while the majority of potential SMR sites are associated with utilities and government owned entities, a significant minority are linked to laboratories and private industrial players.

SMR site approvals are likely to be simpler than for large scale plants. Due to the smaller size and passive safety features, the area required for an SMR and its associated Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) is likely to be significantly smaller. The EPZ for a grid scale plant can extend up to 60 miles (made up of the 10-mile Plume Exposure Pathway EPZ (PEPZ) and 50-mile Ingestion Exposure Pathway EPZ (IEPZ)). The Sizewell nuclear power plant in the UK has a 15km and 30km EPZ. The EPZs for SMRs are being developed with flexibility, as SMRs' design allows for smaller EPZs. Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission are establishing performance-based programs that recognise SMR design advances and offer alternative emergency preparedness requirements to reduce the need for exemptions. Some SMR designs are being planned with site-boundary EPZs.

Of the SMRs covered by the Dashboard, three are licensed to operate, seven have been granted a licence to construct, seven have submitted a licence application, and 33 SMR designs are in pre-licensing activities. This is a sign of a healthy SMR pipeline. While three are operating, many dozens are currently undergoing the regulatory process.

Financing

Traditionally, the nuclear industry was financed by governments, with a small amount of private financing. However, private investment in nuclear is surging. In 2023, there were USD15.4bn of funding announcements for SMRs (outside of Russia and China), around one third of which was private funding. Notably, three SMR companies are publicly traded: NuScale, Oklo, and NANO Nuclear Energy. While public funding will remain critical, more investment through public-private partnerships is needed to assure that SMRs are a viable option into the future. The role of large power users (likely the hyperscaler data centre providers) in providing this private funding is becoming more prevalent. Amazon announced last year that it was going to invest more than half a billion dollars in companies developing nuclear power and SMRs. Google has also invested in nuclear and has ordered several SMRs from Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030. Similarly, Microsoft and Meta have recently announced plans to invest in SMRs.

Security

The relatively small size of SMRs is both a security strength and weakness. It is a strength as there is no need for a vast EPZ security perimeter around an SMR. Additionally, SMRs can be deployed underground, even below water, which offers protection from external threats. SMRs also offer a form of ‘energy security’ in that once installed, their upkeep is not dependent on consistent imports of fuel etc., with some SMR designs requiring refurling every three to seven years, and others aiming for up to 30 years. However, the smaller size and geographic footprint may also limit the usual layered protection made possible by the EPZs of grid scale plants. In addition, increased digitisation of control systems opens the possibility of cybersecurity threats. Remote maintenance and monitoring systems that are included in some SMR designs also increases this cyber risk potential. Current legal and regulatory frameworks need to be reviewed in the light of this different security threat environment. Aspects of this different approach to security are considered in the Dashboard with a number of SMR design incorporating ‘security by design’ into the SMR design. This process includes underground siting, robust containment structures and passive safety systems that reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate the consequences of sabotage.

Public engagement

While this issue is covered last, it is vital to the success of SMRs and the energy transition. SMR projects will not advance far unless a strong relationship is built between those developing SMRs and local communities. Particularly in countries like the UK, where planning laws mean public buy-in is often required for building projects, educating local communities about the benefits of SMRs is important. The Dashboard shows that SMR developers are contributing to a broader public understanding and acceptance of nuclear technologies including through town hall meetings. Educating the public on the benefits of SMRs not just to their local community (although such benefits are sizeable) but to the wider energy transition and global carbon reduction efforts is a crucial part of generating public acceptance of nuclear.

SMRs are coming

With 120 designs and counting and over 30 countries looking to deploy SMRs to meet rapidly increasing energy demand, we can expect to see two or three SMR designs move from first of a kind to nth of a kind over the next decade.

The September 2025 announcement of commercial deals of new SMR deployments in the UK (in addition to the Rolls Royce SMRs previously announced) as well as the first micro reactor demonstrate the speed of developments.

The benefits of the modular design as well as the potential for an element of passporting of designs through a badge of origin approach are expected to increase the number of SMRs being deployed and reduce costs of nuclear power. With a more streamlined design approval process, passive safety features and a smaller overall profile, it is possible that site approvals will also become simpler for SMRs when compared to grid scale plants.

Financing will remain an issue. However, the demand from hyperscalers does provide a new potential source of financing in some use cases. Moreover, public engagement (and education) will be critical to the deployment of SMRs and continued engagement from developers, governments and regulators is required.

The decision raised questions about how the city gave up on the contract that would have created seven child care facilities and served more than 500 of Santa Ana’s most vulnerable youth, and why it failed to inform the City Council before doing so.

Santa Ana was awarded $6.7 million by the state in 2023 for child care and development programming. The money would pay for new staff, licensing, training, program equipment, community engagement and state-required facility upgrades. That includes maintaining the overall operation of the program.

“If we ever have a grant of this size, any decisions that should be made should be made here at the dais, publicly,” City Councilmember Johnathan Ryan Hernandez said. “Especially when it comes to millions of dollars.”

What did the city say?

Assistant City Manager Kathryn Downs told the City Council on Tuesday that the contract was relinquished because the city could not handle the state’s complex requirements.

“These concerns included compliance with a series of federal regulations, as well as California Title 5 and Title 22 regulations addressing educational requirements and health and safety issues,” Downs said.

She said the city didn’t have an expert on navigating California’s stringent regulations. According to city records, parks and recreation staff were in the process of hiring a site director who would have had that expertise to regulate and license the city’s facilities.

“There was a plan to bring experts onto staff to help navigate the implementation of this program, and additional resources,” Downs said. “The reality of it is that that's placing a lot of trust in a new staff member to stand up something for the city that comes with complex compliance issues and significant liability if you fail to do so.”

She said the upfront price of the program would have cost the city millions of dollars.

City records and the state’s funding terms and conditions say the city would have been reimbursed for “costs that are reasonable and necessary to the performance of the contract,” which includes startup costs.

In November 2024, the City Council unanimously approved a $915,583 contract with the state as the first round of funding to jumpstart the program.

“With some of the compliance issues such as providing different bathrooms for adults and children with different-sized fixtures … I just don't see how that initial award of $915,000 would have been sufficient for the capital, facilities and equipment that we needed to start up the program,” Down said.

The city would have had to build one restroom for adults, one for children and one that was gender-neutral, Mayor Valerie Amezcua said at the meeting. When asked how much it would cost to build two restrooms at all seven facilities, Downs said the city was looking at $10 million.

But Councilmember Jessie Lopez disputed those costs and said smaller restrooms are required by law for facilities serving toddlers. Santa Ana's program was intended for kids between the ages of 5 and 12, which means the requirements were only for individual locking stalls and not specialized fixtures.

Downs also said the clock was ticking because the state required the city to set up facilities by May 12, which she said was an unrealistic deadline.

But Lopez said only one facility had to be set up with at least one participant enrolled, and the city had the opportunity to request an extension.

When asked for clarification, Santa Ana spokesperson Paul Eakins declined to comment any further on the grant being relinquished —which was first reported by LAist.

Why and who are applauding the decision?

Meanwhile, Amezcua and Councilmember Thai Viet Phan thanked the city for giving up on the $7 million.

“I would love to have had this in the city, but I think we need to be prepared,” Amezcua said. “It could possibly have cost us millions of dollars that we do not have.”

The city is facing a $35 million budget deficit in the next four years.

“We don't have the capacity for this,” Amezcua said. “I appreciate you guys, Mr. City Manager and your team, returning this and saying, 'Thank you, but no thank you.'""

Money comes with strings, Phan added.

“I think that with something like this, it's just so far outside the realm of something that we typically do,” Phan said. “It's not just an after-school program to keep kids off the street; it's an entirely new department that we essentially would have to set up.”

Why are some council members disappointed?

Lopez said affordable child care and youth programs are a priority for her office.

“I think it's important for everybody in this chamber to understand that even if 5-year-olds or 10 year-olds don't have lobbyists,” Lopez said. “It is our responsibility to ensure that we do anything and everything that we can to provide the services that they need to live a fulfilling and fruitful life.”

Also at issue, Lopez added, was the lack of communication between the full City Council and the city manager’s office.

“You're saying you communicated this decision to every member of this council, and we have a different recollection of that,” Lopez said. “I just want to make sure that moving forward … when your staff is receiving a directive from this council … that there is going to be an open line of communication.”

Councilmember Benjamin Vazquez said the funds could have been a helpful investment in the city’s centers and urged staff not to let this action deter them from applying for other grants.

“All our staff, thank you for the work that you do, and looking out for grants and swinging for the fences,” Vazuez said. “Think big and go out and get our grants, and we'll support you as much as we can from the dias, and we do appreciate your work.”

A request for comment to the city’s Parks and Recreation Department was also declined by Eakins.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c9e877/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Ffb%2F284872524a28b2cdcaabfb1248c5%2Fimg-9311.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:12.791293

Climate Risk Initiative https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/research/climate/climate-risk-initiative/ 6.","The July 4th, 2025 Central Texas Floods that struck unsuspecting residents along the Guadalupe River, during the pre-dawn hours of a holiday weekend, is the latest in a growing trend of deadly weather-related events.

This loss of life and property occurred within a year of two of the most devastating climate-related disasters in modern U.S. history: the wildfires in California and Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and the Southeast U.S. The historic damage and rebuilding costs have put a spotlight on insurance companies and the state of the insurance industry nationwide. Natural disasters continue to raise questions about insurance companies’ ability to assist in recovery and rebuilding efforts, as well as who will bear the cost in terms of rising rates.

During the early hours of July 4th, an entire summer’s worth of rain poured from a slow moving, tropical storm enriched system within a short span of time, transforming 40 miles of the Guadalupe River, nicknamed Flash Flood Alley, into a deadly torrent that ravaged neighborhoods in multiple counties, and swept away many structures, homes and recreational areas along the river. Casualty reports include a statewide death toll of at least 135 including 36 summer campers from Camp Mystic along the river.

In January 2025, Los Angeles experienced its latest in unprecedented wildfires in the region to date, spurred on by extreme drought and high sustained winds of up to 100 mph. Fires across Los Angeles and Los Angeles County saw a death toll of 28 by the end of January, scores missing, 200,000 forced to flee, 38,000 acres burned and 15,000 structures destroyed.

2024 was an above-average year for Atlantic hurricanes. In late September of 2024, hurricane Helene hit Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, dropping more than a foot of rain in its path, devastating rural communities and causing more than 230 deaths. North Carolina, alone, estimates more than 200,000 people were impacted and upwards of 100,000 homes destroyed or damaged.

With increasingly extreme weather patterns, catastrophic events like the Central Texas floods, the fires in Los Angeles and hurricanes in the Southeast US are becoming more frequent. The growing financial burden on residents, communities, governments, and insurers has raised concerns and, occasionally, outrage about the long-term viability of private societal institutions and public safety nets.

In Texas, despite the state’s Office of Emergency Management issuing a number of National Weather Service updates warning of dramatic spikes in expected storm surge along the Guadalupe River throughout the early morning hours of July 4 in Kerr County Texas, a concerted effort to effectively alert residents of the imminent danger proved inadequate.

In the aftermath of the deadly flood, inquiries into the failure of emergency management systems have prompted local and state officials to claim there was no way to foresee the magnitude of the event. Texas Governor Greg Abbott refused to point to responsibility for failure, stating in a July 9th press conference, “Know this, that’s the word choice of losers. The way winners talk is not to point fingers.”

However, there has been ample statistical data to refute the assertion that extreme weather events, including flooding in Texas hill country, were not predictive. According to data collected and published by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) between 1997 and 2010, billion-dollar disaster events per year averaged $6.6 billion. The average significantly increased to $17 billion disaster events per year between 2011 and 2024. https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/state-summary/US#:~:text=From%201980%2D2024%2C%20there%20were,events%20(CPI%2Dadjusted).

[Editor’s note: NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) will no longer be updating the Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters product.]

Although FEMA data analysis indicates that Texas annually sees the most damage due to flooding, in terms of loss of structures, population and agriculture, approximately 5 million Texans currently reside in areas prone to floods. According to Texas Public Radio, state officials have known the risks but have been slow to address the issue. TPR points to a Texas Water Development Board report published December 2024 which estimates a staggering 54 billion dollars required to address Texas’s most urgent flood prevention needs. To date, the state has allocated a fraction of the estimate, $669 million, towards this goal.

Increasingly, data scientists are finding FEMA mapping and weather modelling, which are based on old and limited data, woefully inadequate. In response to the denials and unpreparedness exhibited in the wake of the Central Texas floods, multiple news outlets have turned to data published by private companies like First Street, a non-profit climate risk analytics company that quantifies and reports climate risks for individuals and communities. In an interview with NPR, data scientist Jeremy Porter of First Street, found FEMA data to be outdated and that dangerous flood zones were more expansive in areas like Camp Mystic than originally known.

Accuweather estimates the disaster cost between $18 and $22 billion in damages and economic losses. In a CNBC article, Loretta Worters of the Insurance Information Institute state that about 2.5% of Kerr county homeowners have flood insurance. Respectively, First Street estimated that more than 20% of homes are in flood danger areas. This is emblematic of homeowners being uninsured or underinsured across the US. Over the past 20 years, 99% of US counties experienced a flood event. It’s estimated that 40% of national flood insurance program claims are from outside high-risk zones.” 1

It’s too soon to know the ultimate impact Texas floods will have on insurance coverage, however some locals have already assessed the financial burden of rebuilding. In an interview with NBC News, Kerrville resident, Cynthia Thomas, states “None of us have flood insurance because my next-door neighbor got a quote for his new house, and it was $6,000 per month for flood insurance… I know people who are not going to be able to rebuild.

While flooding continues to strain communities and insurers with mounting recovery costs, another threat has emerged with equally alarming potential. “A couple of years ago, when KCC released our first wildfire model, it showed insurers that there were large-loss scenarios in the tail of their loss distributions from wildfires that were comparable to hurricane losses,” Karen Clark, founder of Karen Clark and Co. tells the Royal Gazette. The implications are stark. Wildfires, once viewed as regional anomalies, now rank among the most costly catastrophes in the way insurers evaluate disaster risk today.

California is experiencing an increasing number of wildfires that require significant effort and emergency resources to contain. In 2024 alone, the state recorded 8,024 wildfires, burning over one million acres. Future modeling predictions for the state are materializing and proving accurate. Researchers studying long-term extreme climate pattern changes have reported an alarming increase in fire damage over the past 40 years. A study jointly conducted by The Nature Conservancy and emLab, UCSB, finds that between 1979 and 1988 the total acreage burned in California was 3.37 million. The figures rose to 7.08 million total acreages burned from 2009 through 2018.

Losses of natural lands and communities have prompted seven of California’s largest private property insurers to withdraw from the state, reduce coverage, or limit new homeowner policies. This response from insurers, including State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide and Chubb, has contributed to the uncertain state of the California home insurance market. According to the California Association of Realtors 2023 Annual Housing Market Survey, 17% of home buyers had difficulty obtaining insurance and nearly 7% of real estate deals fell out of escrow because buyers were unable to obtain insurance.

To understand California’s complex insurance landscape, one must look back to Proposition 103, the Insurance Rate Reduction and Reform Act, passed by voters in November 1988 with a 51.1% majority. According to Insurance.CA.gov, Proposition 103 aimed to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates, encourage a competitive marketplace, and ensure fair, available, and affordable insurance for all Californians.

Proposition 103 instituted a regulatory system known as the “prior approval” system, where the Insurance Commissioner must approve rates proposed by an insurer before the insurer can implement property and casualty insurance rates. Thorough, impartial review by the Department’s rate regulation experts has saved Californians billions of dollars in premiums while helping to maintain a solvent market able to pay consumers’ claims.

But some believe that Proposition 103 has proven to be a rigid set of regulations that, instead of stabilizing the California homeowners insurance market, it has been the cause of major insurance players withdrawing or reducing coverage. Lawrence Powell, R.J. Lehmann, & Ian Adams in the paper “Rethinking Prop 103’s Approach to Insurance Regulation” (International Center for Law & Economics on November 6, 2023) conclude that “Prop 103 has created an insurance market that struggles to work efficiently even in the best of times and is virtually impossible to sustain in periods of acute stress.” They assert that Proposition 103 has become a set of strict regulations that, instead of stabilizing the California homeowner’s insurance market, has caused major insurance companies to withdraw or reduce coverage. They conclude that Prop 103 struggles in the best of times and is likely unsustainable during periods of high stress.

Leyman and Adams highlight outdated legislative ideology that relies on historic modeling instead of forward-looking climate predictions and weather modeling. They also point out the difficulty of amending Prop 103, which requires a new statute voted on by citizens. The state legislature can only vote “in furtherance of the statute” and cannot overturn it. They state, “The recent story of California’s property & casualty insurance market has been one of uncertainty and induced dysfunction.” 3

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, California’s market was saddled by insurance availability issues stemming from a series of historically costly wildfires.

In the aftermath of increased fire events, Prop 103 appeared untenable for California homeowners insurers. They posted a combined underwriting loss of $20 billion for the massive wildfire years of 2017 and 2018 alone. In comparison, this loss was more than double the total combined underwriting profit of $10 billion generated from 1991 to 2016.

In response to those losses and the inability to adjust rates quickly, the number of non-renewals of California residential-property policies increased by 36% in 2019. Additionally, new policies written by the state’s residual-market FAIR Plan surged by 225% that same year. The FAIR Plan serves as the last-resort insurance for those unable to obtain coverage in the voluntary market.

To slow the surge in FAIR Plan insurance policies, California Department of Insurance in December 2019 enacted moratoria barring insurers from nonrenewing approximately 800,000 policies in ZIP codes adjacent to specified major wildfires. As of November 2022, nearly 2.4 million policies statewide were in ZIP codes under nonrenewal moratoria, many of them added following additional catastrophic wildfires in 2020.

In September 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an emergency executive order directing Califormia’s Department of Insurance to implement reforms designed to stabilize California’s rapidly crumbling property insurance market and to attract insurers to re-enter the market.

Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has instituted the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, that features a faster rate approval process, forward-looking catastrophe modeling, reforms to the California FAIR Plan, and allowing insurers to factor reinsurance costs into rate hikes. Consumer advocates have warned these reforms will benefit insurance companies over property owners and may result in higher costs for homeowners.

Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has introduced the Sustainable Insurance Strategy, which includes a faster rate approval process, forward-looking catastrophe modeling, reforms to the California FAIR Plan and allowing insurers to factor reinsurance costs into rate hikes. Consumer advocates warn these reforms may benefit insurance companies over property owners and could lead to higher costs for homeowners.

As reported by local San Diego CBS 8 affiliate, Commissioner Lara defends the reforms in his interview with CBS 8. “It’s necessary to maintain a thriving insurance market in the state… I have to make sure insurance companies are making a reasonable amount of money to be able to stay in business, grow and be able to maintain their solvency.”

Dave Jones, former California Insurance Commissioner and current director of the Climate Risk Initiative at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law Energy & the Environment, forecasts a gloomy future for California residents after the destruction of recent fires. In a January 16 interview with UC Berkely News, Jones declares that the California insurance market is the “canary in a coal mine,” for the country, and that “the canary is about to expire.” He states that despite September’s emergency reforms designed to stem the tide of insurers dropping or limiting coverage, the LA wildfires highlight the continuing effect of fossil-fuel related climate change.4

Jones tells UC Berkeley News, “Insurers are not able to rate increase their way out of the climate crisis…Before the LA wildfires, insurers said they would be filing for substantial rate increases under the new regulations. After the LA wildfires, with a projected $10 to $20 billion so far in insured losses, insurers will be filing for even higher rate increases…. The fact that this occurred is not something that the insurers did not predict at the time they asked for and got the regulatory changes. So, the LA wildfires should not be a basis for insurers to renege on their commitment to start writing and renewing more insurance in California. But they might nonetheless do so.”5

UC Berkeley News reports that the warming planet’s impact on weather patterns will lead to more natural disasters, outpacing the insurance market’s ability to thrive or survive. They argue that there will be more severe weather-related catastrophes, causing greater loss of life and destruction of homes, businesses, and communities globally. Growing risks and losses from climate change-driven events will outrun rate increases and other regulatory changes granted to insurers in the longer term. All of this means that we are marching toward an uninsurable future in this country and across the globe.

The stakes are especially high for the most vulnerable populations who are unable to evacuate. Of the 27 victims of the Los Angeles wildfires, There were three recorded deaths of people with disabilities. CNN reports that Altadena residents Anthony Mitchell, an amputee who used a wheelchair and lived with his adult son, Justin, who had cerebral palsy, both perished in the fires. Hajime White, Mitchell’s daughter, says officials told her that her father’s body was found by his son’s bed. “He was not going to leave his son behind. No matter what,” she told the Washington Post. “It’s very hard. It’s like a ton of bricks just fell on me.”

CNN also reported on the death of former Australian child star Rory Callum Sykes, who perished on January 8 during the Palisades Fire at the family’s 17-acre Mount Malibu TV Studios estate. His mother Shelley Sykes wrote on X that She had tried to put out the cinders on her property’s roof using a hose but was unsuccessful. “He said, ‘mom leave me’ and no mom can leave their kid. And I’ve got a broken arm, I couldn’t lift him, I couldn’t move him,” Sykes told Australia’s 10 News First. According to CNN, “(Sykes), 32, was born blind with cerebral palsy and had become famous for his speeches on overcoming disability. He was the co-founder of Happy Charity, which according to its site offers, “Hope, Happiness & Health to those that are Hurting.”

Impact on US Insurance Rates

The effects of disasters like the fires in California can be realized across the United States. The New York Times found at least 18 states where insurers are raising rates and reducing the writing or renewing of insurance due to climate-driven extreme weather-related events.” In fact, while the nation’s greatest amount of catastrophic weather anomalies are seemingly concentrated in coastal states particularly California, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, a July 2024 New York Times article reports that insurers are charging some customers in the middle of the country and sectors of the Southeast, far more than other homeowners with similar degrees of risk exposure, and have allocated their premium rates at higher levels relative to the value of their homes.

The New York Times reported on a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) that shows higher premiums being charged to homeowners in states where state officials are more liable to placate insurance carrier’s request for rate increases, as compared to states like California, where officials require greater evidence and data to back up premium hikes in order to maintain affordable rates.

NBER’s findings conclude that parts of the lower Midwest, the South, and Appalachia disproportionately pay more as a share of their relative property value. Meanwhile the Northeast and West pay far lower premiums using a similar guideline. To underscore the disparity, The New York Times points to Enid, Oklahoma, with a population of 50,000, as having one of the highest insurance rates in the nation relative to home values, despite not being in a region with high exposure to weather-related risk and damage.

To add to the complicated state of insurance nationwide, 2024 saw a hyperactive hurricane season that spawned destructive back-to-back named hurricanes in the fall, causing atypical areas of the U.S. to bear the brunt of severe climate disasters. Communities established in places like the foothills of the Blueridge Mountains in Northwest North Carolina, were hit by Hurricane Helene on September 27 causing a tragic degree of human casualties.

Hurricanes in the South East US

Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida on September 26 as a category 4 before traveling a destructive path to North Carolina’s Appalachian Mountains where it struck as a tropical storm and wreaked havoc to life and property.

Cagney Guest, a long time Transylvania County, NC resident, described the event that wiped out towns like Swannanoa and destroyed pockets of town centers, like the art district in Ashville, as inconceivable and devastating. “Hurricanes are not really something that we worry very much about,” he observed. “In the past. We definitely have had a lot of rain from them, and they have caused flooding. We’re in a very rainy place. It’s considered a temperate rainforest.”

The elevated mountainside villages and towns in the area are accustomed to receiving plenty of rainfall. Ancient geological forces created this pristine and diverse biosphere of lavish natural beauty and wonder that was unprepared on September 27 for the cresting of its many tributaries that feed the French Broad River, which flows north from its headwaters in Rosman, North Carolina, through Asheville, and then into Tennessee where it joins other major rivers before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico.

Guest, whose property sits on an escarpment near Rosman, explains his house and land dodged the worst of Hurricane Helene’s fury precisely because of the 2,500 feet elevation of his little valley situated on top of a mountain. Guest surmises that in this region of many tributaries, being situated at the top of a mountain allowed him to go relatively unscathed compared to the inhabitants of the network of valleys in nearby Swannanoa, Bat Cave, and Chimney Rock, which were completely washed away.

He notes a distinct amplification of severe climate patterns affecting his part of the world. “Well, I mean, like everywhere else, it’s escalating, right? Whatever particular weather pattern you have is changing.” He continues, “And I remember distinctly when I was a kid, there was a shift–probably when I was about a teenager, somewhere in the late ’90s–that the old timers at the store would be talking about the weather. And they would say, ‘Oh, you think that was a rainstorm? You should have seen it in 1973.’ They would always talk about there having been crazier weather than this. Then there was a certain shift where they began to say that they had never seen it like this before. That’s the way that it’s been year after year.”

In mid-November 2024, over six weeks after Helene ravaged Western North Carolina, the town of Asheville had its water supply restored, the final death toll surpassed 100, and communities struggled to rebuild in the wake of the mass exodus of service workers who lost the bustling districts filled with art galleries, restaurants and cafes.

As reported by local news affiliate ABC 11, “Although life is slowly returning to normal in Asheville, the effects of the storm are long-lasting. And tourism, which historically has formed a crucial part of the city’s economy, remains a fraction of pre-storm levels. Local businesses in Asheville and Buncombe County are expected to see a loss of $585 million in visitor spending during the first quarter of 2025.” The total amount of destruction from Helene is estimated to be $250 billion, with the majority of the cost not covered by insurance since few homeowners in affected areas have flood insurance.

Those residents who are insured are preparing for insurers to raise premiums to defray the insurer’s bottom line. It is too soon to determine the impact on residents’ ability to rebuild, and they are understandably worried. There is also severe uncertainty for those who are uninsured who must turn to FEMA programs for assistance.

Guest stated, “I have heard rumors that, in general, homeowners insurance is going to go up by as much as 50 %. I don’t want to spread misinformation, but that’s what I’ve heard. And that’s based on the amount of claims that, I’m sure, they are having to pay out. I guess that’s not unreasonable, or at least it doesn’t come out of nowhere. But it’s a big shame because I think that people are tired of paying more.”

In the wake of such disasters, it is reasonable for residents to contemplate leaving. Guest said, “My fiancé and I have done a lot of talking and thinking about that. You know that climate change and the weather that comes with it are very real when it hits here because here is an oasis. To have had something that devastating illustrates that I’m not exempt.”

Pondering the concept of how to regain a sense of safety post Helene from one of the most catastrophic floods in U.S. history, Guest remarks, “Our little chunk of mountains are, I believe, the second oldest on Earth, and particularly the little Blue Ridge/Smokey Mountains down here where I have been above sea level since Pangea. Imagine the ancient continents moving around and sometimes dunking under the ocean? But this particular area has always been above the sea. And so, we have incredible biodiversity because it’s literally a primordial land, and to have had that happen here, I can’t stress enough that I’d felt exempt from the direct effects of this crazy weather. And that has been disabused.”

Less than 2 weeks after Helene, Hurricane Milton roared into southwest Florida on October 9th as a category 3 storm with winds of up to 120 mph, causing many to evacuate. Although spared a direct hit from Hurricane Milton, the Tampa coastline endured massive damage and flooding. Tampa resident Lily Milan was one of the many area residents who chose to evacuate. After receiving tornado warnings, Milan and her family, including pets, made the tense escape to her parents’ home, 200 miles away in Hollywood, FL.

Milan recalls, “I remember when I moved to Florida back in ’88. I don’t ever remember there being tornados. I’ve always thought tornadoes were like a Kansas thing. I’ve never thought about tornadoes before, and it just so happens that, during these hurricanes, we’re that getting now. I believe it was, like, 103 tornadoes in the area because of Milton. And it was crazy. There were people that, before Milton even hit, their houses had been blown away by the tornadoes.”

Days prior to landfall, around the clock weather modeling kept residents informed, causing Tampa to become a ghost town. Milan remembers the moment the decision was made to evacuate, “The amount of anxiety that I got just knowing that a Category 5 was going to hit, and you were not sure where. The uncertainty that anywhere between here and there within that cone, it’s going to hit–and at a category five. That, in itself, was enough for me to say ‘I don’t want to stay here. I need to go. I don’t want to stay anywhere near this cone.’”

Parts of Tampa Bay were still dealing with the storm surge damage and loss it incurred from Helene, but it was much smaller in comparison to the catastrophe in NC. Having to deal with yet another, greater storm, a category 5 barreling more directly towards their area kept residents on edge.

As Milan was fleeing, she contemplated the risk of staying in her community. “When that was happening, that was something I was telling my husband on the drive towards my mom’s house in South Florida. The amount of anxiety and worry, the dogs, the animals, the house. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. And I can’t even imagine being affected directly. I think that was definitely when my mind sent me over to where I wanted to say, ‘I don’t want to live here anymore.’ But where can we go? Because it’s getting worse.”

Modeling and Insurance Rate Fears

In recent years, as climate modeling has predicted an increasing intensification of severity in storms generated in the Atlantic basin, insurance companies have imposed dramatic rate adjustments for residents of Florida. Milan reports that last year she noticed an alarming spike in cost of homeowners insurance. “Last year, my premiums doubled,” she says. “In May, when my insurance was renewing, I realized that the price was outrageous. And that’s when I reached out to my agent and asked if she could please find another company or better rate. She basically said, ‘You are looking at one of the better rates that are out there.’ So I reached out to a group of my friends and realized that everyone was paying around that same rate, maybe even more.”

Learning about new insurance requirements that lower rates, Milan set about clearing brush and trees from around her home and installing a new roof. “In the past, usually when you put in a new roof, it was good for many years. That’s not the case anymore. Now they are asking that you renew your roof every 15 years versus every 30 years. And My roof is 10 years old. So that was one of the reasons they doubled my premiums. I had to get insurance inspectors to do four different types of inspections. And once those things were certified, I sent those in to my insurance company. Because of that, I was able to reduce my premiums back to, maybe, slightly more than what it was before, but not double. So that helped a lot, and that was because of all the policy changes and everything that’s been happening in Florida. A lot of insurance companies have pulled out.

Hurricane Milton caused 33 lives lost and an estimated $50 billion in damage and costs to insurers. Consumers fear what’s to come in the already strained insurance market. According to a September 2024 Bank Rate article, in recent years Florida has lost over 30 insurance companies, and most recently, AAA, Farmers and Progressive announced a reduction in coverage. As of May 2024, there are also 11 Florida home insurance companies in liquidation.6 Bank Rate reports that rate increases have been felt since 1992 when Hurricane Andrew devastated southern Florida. Along with natural disasters, a high rate of insurance fraud have led to rate increases in Florida, while Californians rate increases are partially ascribed to state regulations that have artificially depressed rates relative to risk.

Reached by ABILITY Magazine for comment on the state of Florida homeowner’s insurance, Michael Shea Jr., Executive Vice President, Acrissure Social Services Division, explains that the multi-billion dollar re-insurance fund created 24 months ago by Florida Governor Ron Desantis to curb the precarious market was meant to enable insurers to obtain re-insurance (insurance for insurance companies when claims spike) at a time when doing so is difficult.

Shea explains, “Florida technically doesn’t really have any restrictions on pricing like California., They do have to get their rates approved a lot of times by the state of Florida, they’re an ‘admitted’ market. So, they have to get their rates approved, but there’s really no cap potentially on that. If the insurance company doesn’t like the rate approval, they don’t have to, obviously, do business in the state. So, they can decide not to provide coverage.”

Asked to compare the national state of insurance in relation to climate change, Shea commented, ”I think Florida is a really hard state right now for property insurance. Also, other states right now, like Louisiana. Louisiana rates are some of the highest in the country right now. Texas has actually gotten a lot more expensive due to the fact that it had all those hailstorms. California has issues with fire. So, I think every state is having issues due to weather. Is it global warming? Is it weather pattern change? It’s having an effect on the insurance market. There’s no doubt about it.”

Shea is cautious regarding Florida residents’ concerns about looming rate increases after 2024’s turbulent hurricane season. “I think it’s hard to guess that right now,” he says. “I think the bigger issue here is actually the flood insurance program. I mean, we just had a huge flood event in Florida due to Hurricane Helene and even Milton. So, I think you’re going to have pressure on the NFIP, the National Flood Insurance Program. I think you’re going to have some challenges there. It’s going to be interesting to see on the homeowner’s side.”

Climate change’s impact differs in its effects across the U.S. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicts climate-driven change will result in winners and losers. In contrast to the economic impact of climate change EPA states, “earlier springs and milder winter weather can prolong growing seasons in many regions, increasing crop yields and revenues.” Yet, the American Farm Bureau Federation shows the resulting harm to farmers from extreme weather of $23 billion in loss of crops, which does not include lost livestock and infrastructure.7 With an increase of extreme weather events like wildfires, floods, mudslides, intensification of storms, and prolonged droughts, a warming planet spells a perilous future for all.

At the start of each hurricane season, residents like Lily Milan who live in effected areas prepare for evacuation with important documents like birth certificates, the deed to her house, and medical records. Yet the thought of moving to a more temperate, less risky, area of the country for safety is unthinkable. “I wouldn’t leave my parents behind. I wouldn’t leave my sister behind. What am I going to do alone in another state? So, no, that’s not even an option for me.”

In the meantime, when Cagney Guest reflects on the idea of leaving the area called home by his family for generations, he arrives at the same conclusion. “Although I’m definitely not the first to stand on these wonderful lands, there are those that came before me for sure. I have been here for quite a while. Or the family has. This still remains the high ground. I don’t have much in life, not really from a privileged background. But what I do have is my connection to this wonderful spot that, as other places become more eminently and directly impacted, I assumed that this would continue to be the last place that would still be comfortable, even if not habitable. But with something like this coming through and seeing literally 20, 30 times the devastation I’ve ever seen in my whole life. It robs you of that feeling. But no, I wouldn’t leave for a million bucks.”

Several mountain communities ravaged by Helene are rebuilding, however, Guest wistfully mourns the transformation. “We have a local author from the 1920s and ’30s, the name of Thomas Wolf, among his books is one called “You Can’t Go Home Again.” And the sentiment’s about how once you go away for long enough, when you return, your parents are no longer your parents. They’re an elderly couple. Everything is changed. Everything is different, and so home doesn’t exist anymore.

Guest observed the economic impact on surrounding communities, “A lot of that is what’s going on in Asheville. There’s an exodus. I’ve heard of people who work in service industries that have collapsed and closed down. I’ve worked in restaurants, and you’re paycheck to paycheck. The places they worked are closed indefinitely, and there’s no nest egg to lean on. What constituted the culture of the area in Asheville is physically leaving in a lot of cases or has been washed away. It will definitely rebuild. It remains in a beautiful giant valley in a beautiful part of the world, but there’s a lot of intangible things about it that got washed away and that are gone forever. Too many people’s lives changed too drastically for it to come back the same.

The increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven disasters like the Central Texas floods, California wildfires, Hurricane Helene and more are fundamentally reshaping the insurance landscape. As traditional risk models have become outdated and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration face cuts in both budget and services, residents nationwide face skyrocketing premiums, reduced coverage, and the daunting prospect of an “uninsurable” future. This growing crisis highlights the urgent need for adaptive policies and proactive measures to protect vulnerable communities and ensure the long-term viability of essential safety nets against the escalating impacts of a warming planet.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have rocketed 20% in the past week, fueled by CEO Elon Musk’s bold move to scoop up about $1 billion in company stock. Disclosed on September 15,, Musk’s purchase of roughly 2.57 million shares marked his first open-market buy since 2020, signaling unshakeable confidence amid board proposals for a staggering $1 trillion pay package tied to ambitious milestones.

This insider bet propelled TSLA from year-to-date lows, flipping the stock positive for 2025 after a turbulent ride. Over the last three months, shares have surged more than 30%, while the stock is up over 78% in the past year, rebounding from April’s $212 intraday slump. With Q3 earnings slated for late October, investors face a pivotal question: lock in gains and sell now, or ride the wave?

The rally reflects optimism in Musk’s vision, but underlying sales woes and policy shifts loom large. As buyers rush electric vehicle (EV) purchases before the $7,500 federal tax credit vanishes on September 30, is this surge sustainable — or a peak before the plunge?

Navigating Sales Headwinds in Key Markets

Tesla’s EV dominance is under siege, with sales faltering across major regions. In Europe, deliveries plunged 49% year-over-year in August, battered by subsidy cuts and fierce competition from Chinese rivals like BYD.

China, Tesla’s second-largest market, saw a 2% drop last month amid a price war and economic slowdown, despite aggressive discounts. Even in the U.S., where Tesla commands 38% of the EV market — its lowest in eight years — sales dipped 6.7% in August, as consumers flock to fresher models from Ford (NYSE:F) and Hyundai.

Musk’s brief stint advising the Trump administration on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) diverted his focus, alienating some buyers and hurting brand perception. Though he’s stepped away and pledged renewed commitment to Tesla, the damage lingers.

The board’s approval of his exorbitant pay package, potentially worth $975 billion, aims to tether him long-term, suggesting the EV pioneer is refocusing. Yet, with Musk owning about 13% of shares pre-purchase, his buy underscores a pivot toward AI and autonomy over pure vehicle sales.

A Short-Term Sales Spike?

September could deliver a silver lining, with Tesla sales potentially spiking as buyers dash to snag vehicles before the EV tax credit expires. U.S. EV sales hit records in August, up nearly 20% year-over-year, driven by the impending deadline.

Analysts predict the third quarter will be the strongest quarter ever for EVs, with Tesla possibly benefiting from this frenzy — Model Y and Model 3 remain eligible for the full $7,500 incentive if delivered or contracted by month’s end. IRS guidance allows binding contracts with payments before September 30 to qualify, even for later deliveries, easing the rush slightly.

However, this bump feels fleeting. Broader EV demand remains soft, squeezed by high interest rates and range anxiety. After the tax credit’s expiration, prices could jump effectively by $7,500, dampening momentum further. Tesla’s Q3 report next month might dazzle with a quarterly increase, but Q4 projections look grim, with Musk himself warning of “tough quarters” ahead.

Key Takeaways

The market’s euphoria seems to front-run this temporary sales lift, pricing in optimism that could unravel after earnings. A post-rush drop is likely, pulling TSLA back as EV headwinds persist. Long-term, though, the buy thesis evolves beyond vehicles.

Energy storage deployments hit 9.6 GWh in Q2, solar integrations grow, and robotics like Optimus promise transformative revenue. These segments, not just EVs, could propel the stock higher over years.

For long-term investors, Tesla remains a compelling buy — but not at current peaks. Hold off for the inevitable pullback as the real value lies in patience.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/imageForEntry29-u2e.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:01:20.882314

California

Rep. Young Kim (R-CA-40) noted, “I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that expends clean energy, supports American jobs, and strengthens our national security. We need leases, permits, and pipelines, alongside robust investment in renewables like geothermal energy.” She added that she championed the Harnessing Energy At Thermal Sources (HEATS) Act to help lower energy costs for families, and that she is leading the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) Authorization Act to diversify supply chains and ensure energy security. “It doesn’t have to be one or the other – natural gas or renewables, environment or economy. We can do both,” she said.

Colorado

Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO) recalled that he set a goal for Colorado of 100% renewable energy by 2040. In less than five years, his administration has secured a commitment to reduce power sector emissions by more than 85% by 2030.“With the actions we’re taking, we’ve bent the cost curve for clean energy technologies, ensuring that they’re the most cost-effective solution for growing Colorado. Wind and solar are the cheapest ways to power an electrified future with EVs, modern manufacturing, and clean buildings.” He noted that his administration partnered with the state’s largest utility, Excel Energy, to announce a new procurement for 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of new wind and solar resourcing in the state. “We continue to push forward in Colorado, investing in groundbreaking technologies and strategies to protect our air and water, strengthen our economy, create good-paying jobs, and yes, save people money in the process,” he said.

Georgia

“As the number one state for business for 11 consecutive years, we have celebrated record-breaking jobs and investments coming to all four corners of the Peach State,” explained Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA). “With that growth, we know we must continue innovating to provide the power that both hard-working Georgians and job creators need to succeed.” He pointed out that Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the first nuclear reactors built in the country in over 30 years, are located in the state, with Plant Vogtle as the largest clean energy generator nationwide. “As our nation’s industries, like manufacturing, continue to expand and drive population growth, we must continue finding innovative ways to meet the demand for reliable energy,” he concluded.

Idaho

“Idaho is a national leader in the use of clean, renewable power, and it is the fifth highest in the nation for electricity generated from these sources,” Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID) stated. He highlighted that 68% of the total electricity generated in Idaho comes from a clean energy source and that the sector creates more than 15,000 jobs. He added that he continues “to press for collaborative solutions to our nation’s overall energy needs and encourage an all-of-the-above energy strategy that promotes our energy independence and national security.”

Michigan

Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II (D-MI) recalled that he and Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) signed a “historic clean energy law to lower costs, create jobs, and fight climate change.” Since 2022, their administration has created 127,000 clean energy jobs. “Our work has helped more Americans turn on their lights, heat or cool their homes, and charge their devices for less money,” he elaborated. “Let’s keep working together to invest in clean energy, grow our economy, and build a bright future for our state, nation, and the world.”

“This week is an important reminder that a clean energy future is critical, not only for ensuring that future generations inherit a healthy environment, but also for securing America’s energy future,” said Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI-06). “It’s about creating good-paying jobs, protecting our environment, strengthening our national security, and ensuring every community has access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.” She reminisced on her support for legislation that invests in clean energy innovation, reduces emissions, and leaves no community behind. “We have a responsibility to act, and to act boldly,” she said. “We’re all in this together.”

New York

Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY-01) observed that his experience in the Navy, including three deployments across the Pacific, gave him the chance to see firsthand “how our ships, aircraft, and missions relied on reliable American energy, and how adversaries like China, Russia, and regimes in the Middle East weaponize energy to squeeze our allies, manipulate markets, and tilt the balance of power.” He voiced his support for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, including the safe and clean extraction and production of oil and gas, the growth of nuclear power, the addition of wind and solar power, and investments in grid resiliency. “I know that energy security is national security. America can never afford to be dependent on foreign nations for the energy that keeps our economy running and our military strong,” he explained. For example, he highlights that he fought to preserve energy tax credits in this year’s budget reconciliation bill. “My mission is clear: to ensure the next generation inherits a nation that is stronger, safer, and more secure, and that starts with American energy leading the way.”

North Carolina

“Facing a changing climate with determination and resilience is paramount to safeguarding America for generations to come,” observed Rep. Greg Murphy (R-NC-03). His district covers approximately 80% of North Carolina’s coast, including the Outer Banks, which presents challenges posed by hurricanes and other intense weather events. In response, he initiated the Water Adaptations to Ensure Regional Success (WATERS) Summit, a bipartisan effort to bring together leaders, experts, and stakeholders to develop solutions.

Plus, Rep. Murphy’s district plays a crucial role in advancing clean energy solutions: “For a few years now in the Outer Banks… there’s a tremendous amount of renewable energy research being conducted.” Rep. Murphy highlighted the work of the Coastal Studies Institute, a research partnership led by East Carolina University, in particular. He added, “To power our future efficiently and responsibly, we need to utilize all the energy resources at our disposal… If we can put a man on the moon, we can lead the world in transitioning to cleaner forms of energy production.”

Rep. Deborah Ross (D-NC-02), the ranking member for the Energy Subcommittee for Science, Space, and Technology, remarked that she has been working on clean energy issues for nearly two decades. “We all know that we need more energy right now,” she said, “but we also need that energy to be inexpensive and not harm our environment, and that’s where clean energy comes in.” Not only has the cost of clean energy gone down, but the number of sources has increased, “and we’ve got to make sure that we continue to invest in them and use them.”

Oklahoma

Gov. Kevin Stitt (R-OK) highlighted that Oklahoma is one of four states with 45% of its energy coming from clean energy sources. “We should be unleashing energy production and meeting the needs of American consumers. To do that, we need an energy abundance agenda. In Oklahoma, we let the free market drive our energy production.” As a result, he remarked, innovative companies have established a presence in the state. For example, USA Rare Earth developed the country’s first rare earth metal and neo-magnet manufacturing facility, and Westwin Elements opened the country’s only nickel refinery; “producing them here at home strengthens American security.” He added that the state’s behind-the-meter laws give companies more choice over their power solutions. “We’re showing the country how to take control of our own energy future. Oklahoma’s ready to meet our nation’s energy needs, and I’m declaring it the year of the energy abundance agenda.”

The study analyzes employment in industries including renewable electricity generation, biofuels, electric vehicles, energy efficiency, battery storage and grid modernization.

The analysis does not account for changes in U.S. policy since President Donald Trump took office in January. Since then, his administration has taken a string of measures to unravel federal support for wind and solar projects that were championed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and instead promoted fossil fuels.

The number of Americans employed in clean energy exceeds those employed by oil, gas and coal by three to one, E2 said.

The states with the most jobs in wind and solar include California, Texas, Florida, New York and Massachusetts, according to the report.

Energy efficiency jobs, which include installing efficient heating, cooling and lighting systems and manufacturing certified appliances account for nearly 2.4 million of total sector employment.

Since President Trump took office, almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled, according to U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy. As the new administration slashed subsidies and regulatory support for wind and solar, companies involved in these industries have canceled projects worth a total $18.6 billion.

The radical change in federal government attitudes towards the wind and solar industries has already shaken them, causing bankruptcies and stock price slumps. Job losses in this context are practically inevitable, especially with local communities’ opposition to new wind and solar capacity continues to grow.

However, the study also cautioned that many of these positions are at risk due to the Trump administration’s initiatives to hinder renewable energy development.

In 2024, the clean energy sector saw a 2.8% increase in employment, adding 100,000 jobs and bringing the total to over 3.5 million people, Reuters quoted figures from the study in a report.

This data comes from an annual study on clean energy jobs conducted by E2, an environmental advocacy group, for the past ten years.

Growth in US states

In the past year, several states have demonstrated remarkable growth in the clean energy sector, significantly contributing to the nation’s transition towards sustainable energy sources.

Leading this charge were Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, and New Jersey, each exhibiting substantial increases in clean energy job creation.

This surge in employment reflects a broader trend of investment and innovation within renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across these diverse economic landscapes.

The growth in these states underscores the increasing economic viability and widespread adoption of clean energy solutions, fostering a green workforce and driving local economies forward.

The study revealed that clean energy accounted for over 80% of all new energy sector jobs in 2024.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said in a statement.

Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.

Assessment of workforce dynamics

The comprehensive study undertook a detailed analysis of employment trends and opportunities across a crucial spectrum of burgeoning industries, all of which are central to the global transition towards a more sustainable and low-carbon economy.

It also examined job creation and growth within renewable electricity generation, encompassing solar, wind, and hydropower.

Additionally, it analysed the workforce dynamics in biofuels production and the burgeoning electric vehicle industry.

The report further scrutinized employment in energy efficiency initiatives, battery storage solutions, and critical grid modernization projects, providing a holistic view of the green job market.

This analysis did not reflect shifts in US policy since President Donald Trump assumed office in January.

Trump’s administration has subsequently implemented numerous measures to dismantle federal support for wind and solar initiatives, previously championed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, in favor of promoting fossil fuels.

According to E2, clean energy employs three times as many Americans as the oil, gas, and coal industries combined.

According to the report, California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Massachusetts are the states with the highest number of wind and solar jobs.

Of the total jobs in the energy sector, nearly 2.4 million are in energy efficiency, encompassing the installation of efficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems, and the manufacturing of certified appliances.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 05:57:51.218821

The Advanced Aerial Mobility Activation Fund, which will receive a second round of funding through the directive, funds projects for drones, helicopters and other electric aerial vehicles.

M-Air will be a part of M-City, a public-private partnership within the University’s Transportation Research Institute that advances innovation in transportation and aerial mobility.
“I do think that at the end of the day, this is about having an integrated mobility ecosystem,” Johnson said.","On July 17, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive directive to establish the Advanced Air Mobility Initiative, a program that would further the state of Michigan’s advanced aerial vehicular capabilities and support infrastructure expansion in the aviation sector. The Advanced Aerial Mobility Activation Fund, which will receive a second round of funding through the directive, funds projects for drones, helicopters and other electric aerial vehicles.

The executive directive also allocated more than $4.1 million to four new projects supporting these initiatives, including CVS Health, Traverse Connect, Jack Demmer Automotive Group and M-Air.

M-Air will become a new 40-mile air mobility corridor, or dedicated transportation route, that will connect University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus to Michigan Central in Detroit. M-Air will be a part of M-City, a public-private partnership within the University’s Transportation Research Institute that advances innovation in transportation and aerial mobility.

In an interview with The Michigan Daily, M-Air director Venkat Viswanathan said M-City was born to be a living lab where students, researchers and other experts could collaborate on different aerial mobility projects and test them in one space.

“The core idea being that we have amazing students and postdocs that come to University of Michigan, and in order for them to get experience beyond classroom learning and research that they do get access to a facility that has the ability to test things at a larger scale than you can typically do in a classroom setting or in a research setting,” Viswanathan said.

Engineering senior Eli Goreta, vice-president of Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles, told The Daily she hopes the M-Air mobility corridor will unlock new opportunities to test different aerial vehicular projects at the University.

“I think when it’s out, it’ll definitely have a huge impact,” Goreta said. “Drone application, currently, really involves limit testing, both on distance and flight time. The way that conventional testing is currently happening is usually in a pretty confined space, usually just like a farm or a small airfield, or M-Air in a very closed, confined space, but allowing testing to take place over a very long distance with limited restriction will definitely have a huge help on long range, efficient drone research.”

Goreta said the addition of funding from the state of Michigan will strengthen the existing relationship between the private and public sectors, which is vital for advancements in aerial mobility.

“The more money that we can put into drone research, the better,” Goreta said. “But I think a technical partnership with more of a corporate setting would be useful, because then research can be more applicable towards actual use cases.”

In an interview with The Daily, Justine Johnson, chief mobility officer at Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said increased funding for the Advanced Air Mobility Initiative will introduce new employment opportunities for Michigan citizens, assist workers with a background in manufacturing for a transition into aviation and connect university students with employment opportunities.

“M-Air (is) really focusing on having a space with that connects Detroit to Ann Arbor in a very different way, really facilitating the role of bringing in startups, but also exposing students at all levels — from K through 12 — to those who are at the university level, about opportunities and career paths within Advanced Air Mobility and emerging aviation,” Johnson said.

Johnson also said there is a lot of potential for aerial vehicles to be applied across a variety of industries and to bridge gaps between land and aerial vehicular resources.

“I do think that at the end of the day, this is about having an integrated mobility ecosystem,” Johnson said. “This is not like auto versus aviation. It’s not that, right? It’s, how do these two complement each other?”

Johnson said she looks forward to seeing how Michigan will advance in its capacity for aerial aviation innovation through the executive directive.

“This is such a big opportunity for the state of Michigan to demonstrate to the world how we lean into manufacturing, how we’re good at it, the jobs that are going to be created, the industry that will be attracted and how we’re connecting the dots to really make sure we have an integrated mobility ecosystem,” Johnson said.

We’re in the midst of a global solar revolution. Don’t believe it? Just look at the latest numbers.

In the first six months of this year, the world built 64% more new solar energy capacity than it did in the first half of 2024, according to think tank Ember. The 380 gigawatts’ worth of solar installed through June of this year is roughly equal to the amount of solar installed in all of 2021 and 2022 combined.

The story of this global solar boom is, really, the story of solar growth in China.

The country, which is the world’s largest producer of solar equipment and most other clean-energy technologies, on its own deployed 256 GW of new solar over the first half of this year — more than two-thirds of the global total. That’s double the amount it installed during the same period last year.

China’s rapid buildout of solar is welcome news. The country emits more planet-warming greenhouse gases than any other, in large part because it burns prodigious amounts of coal to produce electricity for its 1.4 billion citizens. But solar and other renewables are now putting enough of a dent in the country’s coal use that some analysts expect China’s overall emissions to decline this year.

Outside of China, the rest of the world installed just 15% more solar capacity in the first half of this year than it did in the first half of last year.

The two next-biggest solar installers over this time period were India, at 24 GW, and the U.S., at 21 GW. The U.S. is still managing to push solar to new heights despite the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy.

Overall, solar provided just 7% of electricity generated around the globe last year.

Now Orange and OptiGrid have introduced a new battery-integrated DC fast charger.
Using an onboard 180 kWh battery, the Orange Juicer steadily draws energy from on-site utility connections, and delivers it on demand.
“As more customers accelerate adoption of Orange EV trucks and electrify other site equipment, we’ve seen infrastructure upgrades cause serious holdups,” said Kurt Neutgens, co-founder and President of Orange EV.
The citrus-themed charger works with Orange EV trucks today, and is adaptable for other fleet equipment.","We’ve been covering Orange EV for a decade, during which time we’ve seen a couple dozen other commercial EV startups go out of business. Part of Orange’s winning formula: the company targeted a segment that was (and remains) a perfect use case for EVs: terminal tractors (aka yard dogs or yard goats).

Orange’s sister company, OptiGrid, addresses a couple of the most significant barriers to fleet electrification: high infrastructure costs and long waits for utility upgrades. OptiGrid’s charging platform, which originated from technology created at FreeWire, is now in its fourth generation and has undergone nearly a decade of engineering development.

Now Orange and OptiGrid have introduced a new battery-integrated DC fast charger. Using an onboard 180 kWh battery, the Orange Juicer steadily draws energy from on-site utility connections, and delivers it on demand. “The result is full charging performance with up to 85% less grid input power, resulting in a dramatic reduction of both installation timelines and upfront costs,” Optigrid explains.

“As more customers accelerate adoption of Orange EV trucks and electrify other site equipment, we’ve seen infrastructure upgrades cause serious holdups,” said Kurt Neutgens, co-founder and President of Orange EV. “The Orange Juicer solves that challenge, giving fleets a fast, scalable and cost-effective charging platform that utilizes existing on-site power.”

Optigrid says deploying the Orange Juicer allows fleets to avoid expensive utility upgrades, trenching, and construction by using existing power, so they can start running electric trucks in weeks, not years. The citrus-themed charger works with Orange EV trucks today, and is adaptable for other fleet equipment. The system features a modular design that enables it to be expanded and/or relocated as site needs change.

“Fleet operators are tired of waiting on infrastructure that doesn’t match their electrification schedule,” said Tyler Phillipi, CEO of OptiGrid. “The Orange Juicer gives them the power to deploy today, with charging performance that rivals high-capacity systems but requires just a fraction of the grid input.”

The Orange Juicer will be commercially available in Q4 2025.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Orange_EV__1_crop__2.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 04:58:07.306267

However, the study also cautioned that many of these positions are at risk due to the Trump administration’s initiatives to hinder renewable energy development.

In 2024, the clean energy sector saw a 2.8% increase in employment, adding 100,000 jobs and bringing the total to over 3.5 million people, Reuters quoted figures from the study in a report.

This data comes from an annual study on clean energy jobs conducted by E2, an environmental advocacy group, for the past ten years.

Growth in US states

In the past year, several states have demonstrated remarkable growth in the clean energy sector, significantly contributing to the nation’s transition towards sustainable energy sources.

Leading this charge were Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, and New Jersey, each exhibiting substantial increases in clean energy job creation.

This surge in employment reflects a broader trend of investment and innovation within renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across these diverse economic landscapes.

The growth in these states underscores the increasing economic viability and widespread adoption of clean energy solutions, fostering a green workforce and driving local economies forward.

The study revealed that clean energy accounted for over 80% of all new energy sector jobs in 2024.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe said in a statement.

Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.

Assessment of workforce dynamics

The comprehensive study undertook a detailed analysis of employment trends and opportunities across a crucial spectrum of burgeoning industries, all of which are central to the global transition towards a more sustainable and low-carbon economy.

It also examined job creation and growth within renewable electricity generation, encompassing solar, wind, and hydropower.

Additionally, it analysed the workforce dynamics in biofuels production and the burgeoning electric vehicle industry.

The report further scrutinized employment in energy efficiency initiatives, battery storage solutions, and critical grid modernization projects, providing a holistic view of the green job market.

This analysis did not reflect shifts in US policy since President Donald Trump assumed office in January.

Trump’s administration has subsequently implemented numerous measures to dismantle federal support for wind and solar initiatives, previously championed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, in favor of promoting fossil fuels.

According to E2, clean energy employs three times as many Americans as the oil, gas, and coal industries combined.

According to the report, California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Massachusetts are the states with the highest number of wind and solar jobs.

Of the total jobs in the energy sector, nearly 2.4 million are in energy efficiency, encompassing the installation of efficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems, and the manufacturing of certified appliances.

""Democrats argue that because the termination clause was no longer in subsection (h), Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill amending subsection (h) to end the credit in 2025 was legally ineffective,"" Ayers wrote in a HARDI blog post.
The Democrats' letter argues that the 25C credit remains in effect through 2032 and calls on the IRS to affirm that.
""At the time the law (OBBBA) was passed, subsection H contained the expiration date, and that’s what was amended,"" Ayers said.","Ayers said he doesn't want the Democrats' efforts to mislead consumers or contractors into thinking they'll be able to use 25C after this year. HARDI and other HVACR trade groups are aligned on the issue, he said.

""We would love to see incentives,"" Ayers said Wednesday. ""We don't want a consumer to feel they've been hurt by a contractor based on a press release.""

The 25C credit, also called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, offers a credit of up to 30% of the cost of qualified home energy-saving measures, such as heat pumps, high-efficiency a/c units, and new windows, doors, and insulation. The credit, which reduces taxes owed, is capped at $3,200 a year, with lower limits for specific equipment and improvements.

The credit originated in 2005 and was expanded in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which also extended it through 2032. But the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law in July, calls for 25C to expire after this year.

The 19 House Democrats recently wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), saying the OBBBA cited the wrong subsection, in Section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code, in canceling the tax credit. The IRA had moved the provision for 25C's expiration from subsection (h) of Section 25C to subsection (i).

""Democrats argue that because the termination clause was no longer in subsection (h), Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill amending subsection (h) to end the credit in 2025 was legally ineffective,"" Ayers wrote in a HARDI blog post.

The Democrats' letter argues that the 25C credit remains in effect through 2032 and calls on the IRS to affirm that. ""Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families,"" the letter says, in part.

But Ayers said that, due to what appears to be an oversight, the IRA's changes to 25C weren't written into ""positive law"" because a drafting error left the effective date out. ""As a result, the IRA revisions remain in a note section of the (U.S.) Code, waiting for Congress to pass a technical correction,"" Ayers wrote. Changes to 25C, he said, are in what's called ""slip law,"" which, while valid, does not have the authority of positive law.

""At the time the law (OBBBA) was passed, subsection H contained the expiration date, and that’s what was amended,"" Ayers said.

The IRS is unlikely to change its position that 25C expires after this year, Ayers said. ""The only out that we see is for House Democrats to try and file a lawsuit,"" which is also unlikely, he said.

The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the offices of three of the Democrats who signed the letter to Bessent.

""Time is running out for homeowners to take advantage of the credit, and (HARDI) members should encourage contractors to schedule qualifying projects as soon as possible to avoid installation delays in December,"" Ayers wrote in his blog post.

Study Involved Onsite Participation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense at Company’s RCRA-Permitted Incinerator

NORWELL, Mass., September 18, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clean Harbors, Inc. (NYSE: CLH) (""Clean Harbors"" or the ""Company""), the leading provider of environmental and industrial services throughout North America, today announced the successful results of its latest PFAS study, which affirms that its commercial high-temperature, RCRA-permitted incineration facilities can reliably and safely destroy multiple forms of PFAS (per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances), the ""forever chemicals"" that pose significant human health risks. For the full results from the study click here.

The testing protocols were an extension of the initial tests the Company conducted in 2021 and 2022 using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. The latest study was specifically designed to demonstrate that Clean Harbors’ high-temperature combustion process – ranging from 2,000-2,200 degrees Fahrenheit – could achieve destruction of PFAS compounds while testing for the EPA’s stringent new OTM-50 and 0010 (pre-cursor to OTM-55) emission standards, which were not part of the earlier testing. No other company or destruction technology has met both EPA standards.

""These study results further validate that we can safely and thoroughly destroy a wide variety of PFAS compounds in our high-temperature RCRA-permitted hazardous waste incinerators,"" said Eric Gerstenberg, Co-Chief Executive Officer. ""We have always been confident in the capabilities of our facilities as it relates to PFAS compounds. There has been misinformation around incineration and whether it is safe to destroy PFAS. We excelled using both OTM-50 and 0010 - the EPA’s strictest and newest testing standards for PFAS. We are the only company to have achieved that designation. Most importantly, we demonstrated with certainty that we can effectively eliminate the threat from forever chemicals in its multiple forms and at commercial scale with consistent outcomes.""

The testing for the latest PFAS study was conducted in November 2024 at a Clean Harbors incineration facility, in conjunction with officials from the EPA and the Department of Defense (DoD). EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recently visited Clean Harbors Deer Park incineration facility and saw firsthand how advanced treatment technologies are being deployed to address hazardous materials, such as PFAS. Following the visit, Administrator Zeldin remarked that it is ""impressive to see new American technologies being implemented to protect the environment.""

Mike Battles, Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, ""In recent years, scientific evidence has repeatedly proven the adverse health effects of many of these PFAS chemicals. The EPA and other federal and state regulatory authorities have begun establishing frameworks to protect human health from the impacts of these compounds. The first major step at the federal level was the creation in 2024 of a drinking water standard. Further steps are needed to establish rules for soil remediation and acceptable methods for PFAS destruction. We partnered directly with the EPA for our recent testing to ensure that we not only met their latest standards but gathered the most comprehensive data to help regulators develop effective new regulations for PFAS and protect the country from its health impacts. The U.S. Department of Defense also was involved, given their commitment to protecting service members and addressing potential PFAS contamination at military installations.""

Under the testing conditions, sampling and analysis was conducted for the key PFAS compounds and any potential residual volatile and semi-volatile elements. The test data reviewed the incinerator process waste feed streams, solid and liquid process residue streams, and incinerator stack gases. AFFF concentrate, PFOA, PFOS, PFBA, PFDA, PFHxA, PFHxS, HFPO-DA and other PFAS chemicals were introduced to the incineration facilities during its normal operation. As with the previous tests conducted by Clean Harbors, the latest data showed that these PFAS compounds were not only effectively destroyed, but also that stack emissions resulted in ambient concentrations two to eight orders of magnitude safer than any state or federal ambient air limit or guideline.

The comprehensive test results were shared for review and validation of the study’s conclusions with two highly regarded third parties – Melvin E. Keener, Ph.D., Executive Director for the Coalition for Responsible Waste Incineration (CRWI) and Dr. Jens Blotevogel, a Principal Research Scientist at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CISRO). Both researchers have spent decades evaluating the impacts of environmental organic contaminants.

""We know that many customers want safe, assured destruction of PFAS at scale to eliminate any further liabilities as these chemicals never degrade and often migrate,"" said Gerstenberg. ""There are many locations that have soil, water or both contaminated by PFAS, as well as stockpiles of compounds such as AFFF that customers need solutions to address. In addition, over the decades, PFAS chemicals have leached into groundwater and contaminated drinking supplies. Given that customers are facing PFAS in multiple forms, we introduced our ‘Total PFAS Solution’ in 2024 consisting of eight core elements and providing customers with a range of services to meet all their needs, from analysis to water filtration to remediation to disposal. Today, Clean Harbors remains the only company that can offer an end-to-end, single-source answer for any PFAS need, and at a commercially scalable level.""

Battles concluded, ""Based on the results of this latest rigorous study, we continue to view our end-to-end solution and thermal destruction at our RCRA-permitted facilities as the safest and most viable option for addressing and eliminating PFAS, which in total represents a massive market opportunity in the years ahead. The study data supports the confidence we have in our technology and state-of-the-art air pollution and emission controls; the study results should dispel any lingering doubts about PFAS incineration.""

Energy's $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine Corp. represents a bold and calculated move to position itself at the forefront of this transformation. By merging its zero-emission nuclear and renewable assets with Calpine's low-emission natural gas and geothermal capabilities, Constellation has created the largest clean energy provider in the United States, with a combined generation capacity of nearly 60 gigawatts from zero- and low-emission sources Constellation to Acquire Calpine; Creates America’s Leading Producer of Clean and Reliable Energy[ 1 ]. This strategic pivot not only diversifies its energy mix but also aligns with the explosive growth trajectories of geothermal, nuclear, and battery storage sectors—industries projected to expand at compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) ranging from 6.6% to 22.1% through 2030 Geothermal Energy Market Size & Trends, Share, Report, 2032[ 2 ].

Strategic M&A: A Blueprint for Sectoral Dominance

Constellation's acquisition of Calpine is more than a financial transaction—it is a masterstroke in capturing the dual forces of decarbonization and grid reliability. Calpine's 22 geothermal plants and 38 natural gas facilities complement Constellation's existing nuclear and renewable portfolio, creating a hybrid model that balances the baseload stability of nuclear with the scalability of geothermal and the flexibility of battery storage Constellation to Acquire Calpine; Creates America’s Leading Producer of Clean and Reliable Energy[ 1 ]. This diversification is critical as the U.S. energy grid faces increasing pressure to integrate intermittent renewables while maintaining reliability.

The geothermal segment, in particular, is a strategic win. With global geothermal markets projected to grow to $125.9 billion by 2032 Geothermal Energy Market Size & Trends, Share, Report, 2032[ 2 ], Constellation's entry into this sector via Calpine positions it to capitalize on untapped potential. Geothermal's 24/7 availability and low operational costs make it an ideal complement to solar and wind, especially in regions like California and Texas, where Calpine's assets are concentrated. Meanwhile, the acquisition's inclusion of natural gas plants—while seemingly contradictory to clean energy goals—ensures a transitional bridge to full decarbonization, leveraging existing infrastructure to reduce costs and emissions incrementally.

Sectoral Tailwinds: Nuclear, Storage, and Policy Momentum

Constellation's long-term value creation is further bolstered by its focus on nuclear energy and battery storage, two sectors with robust policy and technological tailwinds. The U.S. nuclear market, valued at $13.3 billion in 2024, is expected to grow at a 5.1% CAGR through 2032 U.S. Nuclear Power Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis, 2032[ 3 ], driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and bipartisan support for zero-emission baseload power. Constellation's nuclear fleet, including the Clinton and Crane Clean Energy Centers, benefits from IRA tax credits and 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) with tech giants like

Battery storage, another cornerstone of the energy transition, is set to triple in market size to $186.9 billion by 2030 Geothermal Energy Market Size & Trends, Share, Report, 2032[ 2 ]. Constellation's investments in grid-scale storage and partnerships with data centers—energy-intensive industries seeking clean power—position it to meet surging demand. The company's plans to integrate battery storage with its nuclear and geothermal assets will enhance grid resilience, a critical differentiator as extreme weather events strain traditional infrastructure.

Financial Strength and Analyst Endorsement

Post-acquisition, Constellation's financials reflect immediate value creation.

Even cautious analysts like acknowledge the strategic merits, upgrading Constellation to “Buy” despite lowering their price target to $232 Constellation Energy Stock Rises As Wall Street Praises Calpine Acquisition[ 5 ].

The regulatory landscape further strengthens the investment case. The IRA's tax credits for hydrogen production and nuclear projects have already catalyzed Constellation's clean hydrogen initiative at the LaSalle Clean Energy Center Constellation Reports Second Quarter 2025 Results[ 4 ]. These incentives reduce capital costs and enhance the economics of high-margin projects, ensuring the company remains competitive in a sector where upfront costs are traditionally prohibitive.

Conclusion: A Compelling Investment Thesis

Constellation Energy's M&A strategy is a textbook example of aligning with secular trends. By acquiring Calpine, it has secured a leadership position in geothermal, expanded its nuclear footprint, and positioned itself to dominate battery storage and hydrogen markets. The company's financial performance, regulatory tailwinds, and analyst endorsements underscore its ability to deliver sustained value. For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition, Constellation offers a rare combination of strategic foresight, operational scale, and policy-driven growth.

520,000 jobs added over last five years, far surpassing growth in fossil fuel and gas and diesel motor vehicle sectors

7% of all new US jobs and 82 % of all new energy sector jobs were in clean energy in 2024

WASHINGTON – Clean energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy in 2024, adding almost 100,000 new jobs and bringing total number of clean energy workers in U.S. to 3.56 million, according to the tenth annual Clean Jobs America report released today by the national, nonpartisan business group E2.

Amid policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth in 2024, the growth in clean energy jobs dropped to its slowest pace since 2020, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023.

Still, jobs in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage and grid and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, and make up an increasingly larger share of the overall U.S. workforce. More than 7 percent of all new jobs added in the U.S. and 82 percent of all new energy jobs added last year were in clean energy occupations.

E2’s 10th annual Clean Jobs America report comes as the clean energy industry is reeling from recent federal policy decisions to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape and legal hurdles aimed at hobbling solar, wind, electric vehicles and other industries. These federal policy assaults come even as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the fastest-growing occupations in America are wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled more than $22 billion planned clean energy related factories and other projects that were expected to create 16,500 new jobs. Analysis by other organizations estimate more than 830,000 jobs could be lost just because of the energy policy rollbacks in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy,”

According to E2’s report, clean energy jobs now account for 42 of all energy jobs in America and 2.3 percent of the overall national workforce. More people now work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers.

More than 520,000 jobs have now been added by the clean energy and clean vehicle sectors over the last five years, an increase of 17 percent—far exceeding employment gains in fossil fuels, gas and diesel motor vehicles, and the overall U.S. economy.

While the sector added the fewest jobs since the pandemic-fueled unemployment crisis, clean energy still grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. workforce (2.8 percent vs. 0.8 percent) amid an economy-wide slowdown in hiring and rising policy uncertainty. Over the last five years, clean energy companies have added jobs 60 percent faster than the rest of the economy.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications for E2. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce. The strength of the U.S. job market and the future of our energy economy are now inseparable from the growth of clean energy.”

Energy efficiency remains the top sector for U.S. clean energy jobs, employing nearly 2.4 million workers nationwide after adding 91,000 jobs in 2024. That’s followed by renewable generation (569,000 overall, +9,000 in 2024) and clean vehicles (398,000 overall, -12,000 in 2024). Despite an industry-wide decline across all motor vehicle sectors in 2024, clean vehicle jobs have grown 52 percent since 2020, adding 137,000 jobs.

Over the past five years, no region added more clean energy jobs and at a faster rate than the South – now home to more than 1 million clean energy workers. From Texas to Virginia, Southern states added 41,000 clean energy jobs in 2024. Western and Northeastern states added more than 20,000 jobs respectively. The Midwest added more than 13,000 jobs. See a detailed regional breakdown in the full report.

At the state level, clean energy continues to drive economic prosperity. Twenty-three states are home to at least 50,000 clean energy jobs and just eight states have more workers employed by fossil fuels than clean energy.

Seventeen states have seen their clean energy workforces jump at least 20 percent in the last five years. See table below for more detail.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors. In addition, the 2025 USEER relies on a unique supplemental survey of 42,800 business representatives across the United States. Created and conducted by BW Research, the methodology has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This survey is used to identify energy-related employment within key subsectors of the broader industries as classified by the BLS and to assign them into their component energy and energy efficiency sectors.

A full methodology on the sectors and types of jobs this analysis includes and does not include is available in the report here.

It’s the latest stage in a legal impasse over the massive lithium project. Environmental groups are trying to make sure nearby residents get the benefits of lithium production, while guarding against harmful impacts. The company says critics are using court challenges to stall an important energy project.

The nonprofits Comite Civico del Valle and Earthworks filed arguments with the Fourth District Court of Appeal last week, asking the court to reconsider a claim they filed in 2024, which a superior court judge dismissed earlier this year.

In their appeal filed Sept. 11, the groups argue that the environmental impact report for the Hell’s Kitchen lithium mine neglects potential problems with air quality, water use, hazardous materials and tribal cultural resources.

“The project would create a high-water demand in an arid desert environment where the drying out of the Salton Sea worsens severe air pollution impacts,” the brief stated.

Lauren Rose, a spokesperson for Controlled Thermal Resources, the parent company of Hell’s Kitchen, denounced what she called a “frivolous legal appeal.”

“This group’s ongoing actions are a clear abuse of the original intentions of (the California Environmental Quality Act) and only serve to delay progress on clean energy projects that are essential to the community, California, and the nation,” she said in a statement to CalMatters.

Hell’s Kitchen promises to unearth thousands of kilotons of lithium, a mineral essential to electric car batteries, cellphones and other electronics. Officials with the nonprofits say they’re in favor of lithium production, but want to ensure it doesn’t compromise the health and environment of surrounding communities.

“We make the case that the project must be corrected to meet the standards that protect our community and our environment,” Luis Olmedo, executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, told CalMatters. “The lawsuit isn’t about stopping clean energy. We are for clean energy.”

The groups also released a report summarizing their call for heightened scrutiny of the project’s impacts. And they laid out demands that included creating a Lithium Valley joint powers authority with a local advisory commission, dedicating more of the state’s lithium extraction excise tax to areas closest to the project, and enacting an additional environmental mitigation fee on lithium produced there.

Under the existing formula, Bombay Beach, a small hamlet on the Salton Sea near the project, would get $8,631 to offset impacts of the project, while larger areas such as El Centro, Calexico and Imperial would get six-figure payments.

READ MORE >>> The rotten egg smell at the Salton Sea isn’t just a nuisance. It can make people sick.

Bari Bean, deputy CEO of natural resources for Imperial County, said in a statement to CalMatters that the lithium tax formula is “a practical and balanced framework that considers both population size and geographic proximity to the lithium resource.”

Bean said a joint powers authority would duplicate existing systems for community input. Imperial County wouldn’t support additional lithium fees, she said, since California already has stricter environmental protections than other states, “making development in California more challenging and often less cost competitive.”

State and federal officials have predicted that the area around the Salton Sea that they call “Lithium Valley” could become one of the world’s biggest sources of the “white gold,” freeing the U.S. from dependence on other countries for the critical mineral.

Imperial County Supervisor Ryan E. Kelley said the project will advance both regional economic growth and U.S. energy goals.

“This initiative will position Imperial County as a leader in clean energy, contribute to California’s sustainability goals, and strengthen the United States’ critical mineral supply chain,” Kelley said in a statement to CalMatters.

However, Rose said the ongoing court challenge has halted that momentum, and risks stalling lithium production in California.

“Just a few short years ago, Imperial County was leading the charge for clean energy and sustainable critical minerals development in the United States,” she said. “Now, billions of investment dollars have flowed to other states, including Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Arkansas, leaving California in the dust.”

Olmedo said his group has never called for injunctions against the project, but wants safeguards on its operations.

Hell’s Kitchen would extract lithium and other critical minerals from super-heated brine in the Salton Sea aquifer and then reinject the brine into the earth, in what the company calls a closed loop system that’s cleaner than other lithium mining systems.

Cal Poly Pomona Professor James Blair, an advisor to Comite Del Civico and member of Imperial County’s Lithium Valley Academic Taskforce, said the environmental review doesn’t prove that claim.

Blair said direct lithium extraction is framed as a “cleaner, greener method of lithium extraction compared to open mine or brine ponds,” but research on similar systems show that they use lots of fresh water. If that’s the case at Hell’s Kitchen it could worsen the decline of the shrinking Salton Sea.

“Novel technologies bring unknown results,” Blair said. “We don’t really know how much water is needed.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/021424-hells-kitchen-lithium-getty-cm1758211711.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=8auwU57E,N,,2025-09-19 07:59:28.309866

The Department of Energy, or DOE, is requesting information from stakeholders including utilities and regional transmission managers on near-term investment opportunities, readiness of projects, expectations on growth in power demand, and constraints that it says it can address.

US President Donald Trump on his first day back in office in January issued an order declaring an energy emergency as artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles are boosting power demand for the first time in two decades.

The DOE has ordered several coal and natural gas plants that had planned to shut to keep operating, the latest US move supporting fossil fuels.

Trump claims that rapid adoption of solar and wind power has made US electricity unstable and expensive, justifying his bid to end most subsidies for them. Reliability has improved in Texas, the US grid with the most renewable energy, however.

The Speed to Power program will help the DOE determine how to use funding programs and national emergency authorities to expand power generation and the grid.

The DOE has billions of dollars in funds and financing through departments including its Loan Programs Office. In July, the DOE axed a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for a transmission line that was meant to send power from wind and solar energy projects in Kansas to cities in the Midwest and East.

Also on Thursday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took actions aimed to boost grid security. FERC approved and proposed rules to reduce the risks of the supply chain, cyber attacks and electrical grid disruptions caused by extreme cold, which can sometimes lead to blackouts. Green energy opponents say that coal plants that have been slated to retire during Trump's second term will be needed.

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, predicted that 38 coal plants that are scheduled to close through 2028 would remain open, either on Trump orders or voluntarily.

The US Energy Information Administration said in July that in the first three months of 2025 power plants burned about 20 per cent more coal than they did during that quarter in 2024.

Amid policy uncertainty and an overall cooling economy, clean energy jobs expanded at their slowest pace since 2020, with about 50,000 fewer new jobs than the year before.
Solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage, and grid jobs made up more than 7% of all new US jobs last year and 82% of new energy jobs.
More than 1 million clean energy workers are based there, and the South added 41,000 jobs in 2024.
At the state level, 23 states now have at least 50,000 clean energy jobs, and in all but eight states, clean energy employment outnumbers fossil fuel jobs.","Clean energy jobs surged in 2024, growing more than three times faster than the rest of the US economy and adding nearly 100,000 new positions. That brought the total clean energy workforce to 3.56 million people, according to the 10th annual Clean Jobs America report from E2.

But growth slowed compared to 2023. Amid policy uncertainty and an overall cooling economy, clean energy jobs expanded at their slowest pace since 2020, with about 50,000 fewer new jobs than the year before.

Even so, the sector still outpaced the broader economy. Solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, storage, and grid jobs made up more than 7% of all new US jobs last year and 82% of new energy jobs. Clean energy also takes a bigger share of the overall workforce: it now accounts for 42% of all US energy jobs and 2.3% of the total workforce. More people work in clean energy today than as nurses, cashiers, restaurant servers, or preschool through middle school teachers.

The report lands as the clean energy industry faces major headwinds. Federal policy moves have canceled projects, revoked tax credits, and added new regulatory hurdles targeting solar, wind, EVs, and more. While not yet reflected in 2024’s numbers, those actions are already hitting jobs hard. E2 found that since January 2025, companies have canceled more than $22 billion worth of clean energy factories and projects that would have created 16,500 jobs. Other analyses warn that more than 830,000 jobs could vanish under Trump’s big bill, signed on July 4.

“This was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said E2’s executive director Bob Keefe. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Clean energy and EV jobs have added more than 520,000 positions over the last five years, a 17% increase. That’s far more growth than fossil fuels, ICE vehicle manufacturing, or the economy overall. In fact, over the past five years, clean energy companies have added jobs 60% faster than the rest of the US economy.

Energy efficiency remains the largest employer in the sector, with nearly 2.4 million workers after adding 91,000 jobs last year. Renewable generation jobs reached 569,000 (+9,000 in 2024), while clean vehicle jobs totaled 398,000. The clean vehicle sector shrank by 12,000 jobs in 2024 due to an industry-wide decline across all vehicle sectors, but employment is still up 52% since 2020.

Regionally, the South is leading the way. More than 1 million clean energy workers are based there, and the South added 41,000 jobs in 2024. The West and Northeast each added over 20,000 jobs, and the Midwest added 13,000. At the state level, 23 states now have at least 50,000 clean energy jobs, and in all but eight states, clean energy employment outnumbers fossil fuel jobs.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, E2’s director of research and publications. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce. The strength of the US job market and the future of our energy economy are now inseparable from the growth of clean energy.”

This growth, however, masks underlying vulnerabilities tied to political uncertainty and shifting economic conditions. For investors, understanding the interplay between policy risks and market adaptability is critical to assessing the sector's future trajectory.

Policy Risks: The Shadow of Uncertainty

The slowdown in 2024—adding 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023—was attributed to policy uncertainty and a cooling economy US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. This raises concerns about the sector's dependence on federal incentives, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which catalyzed $80 billion in clean energy investment in 2024 alone US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. A report by Reuters warns that potential shifts in administration priorities, such as those under a Trump-led policy agenda, could undermine this momentum by scaling back subsidies or regulatory support Renewable energy jobs surge, though data differ on where and by …[ 3 ]. For instance, wind power production, concentrated in the Great Plains and Midwest, faces risks if federal tax credits for renewables are not extended Renewable energy jobs surge, though data differ on where and by …[ 3 ]. Similarly, solar sector growth, driven by declining costs and state-level incentives, could stall without consistent policy frameworks Renewable energy jobs surge, though data differ on where and by …[ 3 ].

The IRA's success in leveraging public investment—where every $1 of federal spending stimulated $5–$6 of private capital America’s Clean Energy Jobs Boom: 313,000 New …[ 4 ]—highlights the sector's reliance on policy continuity. Yet, this also exposes it to abrupt reversals. Investors must weigh the likelihood of sustained legislative support against the potential for abrupt policy shifts, particularly in an election year.

Market Resilience: Diversification and Private Investment

Despite these risks, the clean energy sector exhibits remarkable resilience. Energy efficiency remains the largest employer, with 2.4 million jobs, while renewable generation and clean vehicle sectors added 569,000 and 398,000 jobs, respectively US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. This diversification across subsectors—solar, wind, batteries, and grid infrastructure—reduces overreliance on any single technology or policy. Moreover, private investment has surged, with 45 new or expanded manufacturing facilities for batteries, EVs, and solar energy coming online in 2024 US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ].

Regional dynamics further bolster resilience. The South, home to over 1 million clean energy jobs, and states like Texas, California, and Idaho—where growth rates hit 7.7%—demonstrate the sector's geographic spread US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. Notably, 23 states now have at least 50,000 clean energy jobs, and in all but eight states, these jobs outnumber fossil fuel employment US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ]. This decentralization mitigates regional economic shocks and aligns with local policy incentives, such as Texas's $20 billion in clean energy investment US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024 but the feds may kill[ 2 ].

Conclusion: A Dual-Track Strategy for Investors

The U.S. clean energy sector's sustainability depends on a dual-track approach: advocating for stable, long-term policies while capitalizing on market-driven innovation. While the IRA has proven its ability to amplify private investment, investors must remain vigilant about political risks. Diversifying portfolios across subsectors and geographies—particularly in regions with robust policy frameworks—can mitigate these risks.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758256066564.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-19 01:59:03.143734

So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.
OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we’ve got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn’t need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I’m focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let’s say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren’t allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn’t get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it’s not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

“I’m excited about the years ahead for agriculture and Insignum,” said Kyle Mohler, Founder & CEO.","Imagine if your plants could turn purple to let you know they’re sick? That technology has already become a reality thanks to Insignum AgTech.

The company, which is based in Indiana, has announced the successful closing of its Series Seed funding round, raising $2.4 million led by Innova Memphis, with participation from Elevate Ventures, Purdue Strategic Ventures, and others, including the first ever investment from the newly-formed FFA Ventures fund.

Insignum creates new genes out of plant DNA that enables crops to turn color in the early stages of a specific stress, such as disease. The first gene causes corn to turn purple at the site of infection seven or more days before symptoms of the disease are apparent. Research has proven it does not react to other stresses, such as insect attack or physical damage.

Growers and agronomists are empowered to address the problem:

Exactly when the true problem begins, before visible symptoms,

Precisely where to determine priority zones or fields, and

Only if needed by using data driven decisions yielding improved ROI and confidence in crop management.

Insignum’s technology has been successfully field-tested for five years. Testing in 2025 includes an additional leading seed company and the farmer-owned Keystone Cooperative.

“Insignum’s ability to give growers a visual, actionable alert is revolutionary,” said Dean Didato, partner at Innova Memphis. “By enabling precision agriculture to spot fungal pressure and treat appropriately ‘Exactly when, Precisely where, and Only if’ required, their technology is set to transform crop management and promote sustainable farming practices.”

As a result of these successful field trials, Insignum will use funds to advance their first trait through their commercial pipeline. In addition, they will begin development of a disease-signaling trait for canola.

To deliver these milestones, Insignum has hired several new employees.

Chris Cook, Insignum’s Director of Commercial Operations, started in June. Chris rose to Syngenta’s™ Head of Business Development for North America, where he signed key partnerships with Fortune 500 food and fuel companies.

Pon Samuel, Ph.D., started in September as Insignum’s Chief Innovation Officer. Pon had an illustrious career as a Distinguished Laureate at Corteva Agriscience™, most notably as one of the inventors of their Enlist E3® crop trait.

“I’m excited about the years ahead for agriculture and Insignum,” said Kyle Mohler, Founder & CEO. “Challenging times lend themselves to finding new solutions.

To what extent are prospective large load requests subject to consistent, objective screening criteria before they are included in the load forecast?
How do you forecast how the actual electricity consumption of a large load will compare to its requested level of interconnection service?","The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Sept. 18 advanced four reliability measures for the U.S. bulk power system (BPS), formalizing frameworks around supply chain risk, cloud computing and virtual infrastructure, cybersecurity, and extreme cold weather preparedness.

The commission finalized a new supply chain risk management rule—effective in 60 days—that expands protections against vulnerabilities stemming from outside threats. In addition, FERC issued two notices of proposed rulemaking (NOPRs): one to allow utilities to use cloud computing and virtual infrastructure while maintaining security standards, and another to strengthen cybersecurity requirements for low-impact systems against coordinated cyber-attacks. The commission also approved enhanced extreme cold weather preparedness standards, which, when effective on Oct. 1, will require improved generator winterization and clearer communication protocols during cold weather events.

On Thursday, FERC Chairman David Rosner asked six grid operators how they forecast large new electric loads from rapidly growing sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. The query, prompted by unprecedented electricity demand growth, will seek to examine whether existing load forecasting practices can keep pace with the accelerating deployment of high-capacity industrial and commercial customers, and to identify improved methods that better protect reliability and ratepayer value as the sector’s profile evolves.

A Suite of New Rules

At the commission’s open meeting on Thursday, FERC’s three commissioners— Chairman David Rosner, and Commissioners Lindsay See and Judy Chang—voted unanimously to approve four measures that they said were “focused on modernizing the reliability and security of the nation’s Bulk Power System in the face of threats.”

Final Rule on Supply Chain Risk Management Reliability Standards Revisions (RM24-4-000 and RM20-19-000). FERC finalized a new supply chain risk management rule for the U.S. bulk power system to address vulnerabilities in equipment and services supplied by entities deemed risks to national security. The rule directs the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) to develop revised reliability standards within 18 months that strengthen responsible entities’ supply chain risk management plans and extend protections to protected cyber assets (PCAs), which are ancillary devices inside electronic security perimeters that adversaries could exploit as pathways into bulk power system operations.

FERC has said the measure seeks to close gaps exposed by cyber incidents and compliance audits. It recognizes growing threats from nation-state actors and global supply chain insecurities that could compromise grid reliability and cybersecurity. However, owing to industry pushback, the finalized rule stops short of mandating validation of vendor-supplied data, instead encouraging voluntary or centralized approaches.

The supply chain rule traces back to FERC’s September 2020 Notice of Inquiry following heightened national security concerns about foreign equipment in critical infrastructure, particularly communication systems and other equipment, which U.S. security agencies identified as potential vectors for espionage and grid disruption. The initial inquiry drew over 25 industry comments on risks posed by potentially compromised vendors and whether existing Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards adequately addressed supply chain vulnerabilities. In September 2024, FERC issued a NOPR, which prompted NERC and regional reliability entities to submit formal comments by November 2024. FERC also held a March 2025 workshop focused on assessment protocols and vendor validation requirements, which generated additional input from more than 20 industry participants.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standard CIP-003-11 (RM25-8-000). FERC’s NOPR proposes to approve NERC’s CIP-003-11 standard to address the growing risk that coordinated cyberattacks on dispersed, low-impact bulk electric system (BES) cyber systems. “Most individual BES Cyber Systems within the bulk electric system are categorized as low impact,” the NOPR reads. “Individual low-impact BES Cyber Systems have less of an impact on bulk electric system reliability than medium or high-impact BES Cyber Systems and thus have fewer CIP Reliability Standard requirements. Nevertheless, low-impact BES Cyber Systems may still introduce reliability risks of a higher impact when distributed low-impact BES Cyber Systems are subjected to a coordinated cyber-attack.” The proposal stems from NERC’s December 20, 2024, petition, which incorporated recommendations from a Low Impact Criteria Review Team formed after the SolarWinds attack.

CIP-003-11 would require entities with low-impact BES Cyber Systems to:

Authenticate all users prior to permitting access to networks containing low-impact BES Cyber Systems or shared cyber infrastructure;

Protect authentication information while in transit; and

Detect malicious communications to or between low-impact BES Cyber Systems with external routable connectivity.

The Commission is seeking comment to approve the standard as well as feedback on whether NERC should be directed to conduct a study or whitepaper examining evolving threats. If adopted, entities could face significant new documentation, training, and system architecture updates. NERC’s plan calls for a 36-month implementation period following FERC approval.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Virtualization Reliability Standards (RM24-8-000). In a parallel effort to modernize cybersecurity oversight, FERC issued a NOPR based on NERC’s July 10, 2024, filing to revise eleven CIP standards and glossary definitions to accommodate virtualization and cloud computing in bulk power operations explicitly. An errata filed May 20, 2025, adjusted five of those proposals.

The NOPR proposes to approve four new and 18 modified glossary definitions along with the eleven revised standards, clarifying how protections apply to virtual machines, cloud platforms, and software-defined networks used in EMS, SCADA, and other critical functions. The revisions aim to replace prescriptive controls with objective-based criteria, reduce the compliance documentation burden, and provide flexibility for entities to adopt protections aligned with their chosen technology stacks.

FERC is seeking comment on NERC’s proposed technical feasibility exception program to address implementation challenges unique to virtualization.

Order Approving Extreme Cold Weather Reliability Standard and Directing Data Collection (RD25-7-000). FERC approved NERC’s revised Reliability Standard EOP-012-3 (Extreme Cold Weather Preparedness and Operations), which will become effective on Oct. 1, 2025. The enhanced standard, developed in response to the Commission’s June 2024 directives clarifies how to calculate unit-specific Extreme Cold Weather Temperatures, updates the definition and validation process for Generator Cold Weather Constraints, and strengthens corrective action plan timelines so that failures are addressed before the following December. It sets 24- to 48-month deadlines and mandatory compliance enforcement authority (CEA) pre-approval for extensions

New provisions require generators entering commercial operation on or after October 1, 2027, either to meet freeze-protection measures or to declare a constraint preventing operation until mitigations are complete. A standardized, auditable list of “known” and “case-by-case” constraint circumstances (such as design limits on wind turbine towers or cost-prohibitive retrofits) is codified. Entities must also conduct 36-month reviews of all validated constraint declarations to confirm ongoing validity.

FERC also directed NERC to file biennial informational reports from October 2026 through October 2034, detailing by region: the total submitted and approved constraint declarations, the aggregate MVA of constrained capacity, and the rationale for approvals. Each filing must also include a narrative analyzing notification practices to reliability coordinators, timelines for corrective actions, and the system-wide risks of allowing up to three years for freeze mitigation.

Load Forecasting Scrutiny Targets AI-Driven Demand

On Thursday, Chairman Rosner dispatched letters to six regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs)—CAISO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO, PJM, and SPP—asking for standardized feedback on large load forecasting practices, particularly for data centers supporting artificial intelligence operations. The inquiry appears to address growing concerns about forecast accuracy as utilities project hundreds or thousands of megawatts in new demand growth.

Rosner’s letter stresses the critical importance of accurate forecasting, noting that improvements of “even a few percentage points in the right direction—up or down—can impact billions of dollars in investments and customer bills. Put simply, we cannot efficiently plan the electric generation and transmission needed to serve new customers if we don’t forecast how much energy they will need as accurately as possible,” he wrote.

Rosner asked each RTO/ISO, along with their utilities and state regulators, for their perspective on:

“How do you, the utilities in your footprint, and state regulators obtain information that verifies when and whether prospective large loads in your region will reach commercial operation?

To what extent are prospective large load requests subject to consistent, objective screening criteria before they are included in the load forecast?

How do you forecast how the actual electricity consumption of a large load will compare to its requested level of interconnection service?

How do you coordinate with utilities at the regional or interregional level to share best practices on large load forecasting and ensure that large load interconnection requests are not double-counted?”

Notably, Rosner suggested RTOs and ISOs could borrow from the generator interconnection process, which applies observable milestones (such as signed contracts, financial security deposits, and site control) as objective thresholds before speculative projects are factored into regional load forecasts.

“Our experience to date tells us that large loads, such as data centers, have characteristics that call for new and improved forecasting methods,” he wrote. “Given the size and volume of new large load interconnection requests, I’m optimistic that utilities have an opportunity to apply similar criteria to those currently used to assess the commercial readiness of large projects in the generator interconnection queue.”

The timing reflects mounting pressure from consumer advocates and state regulators concerned about cost allocation for speculative projects. Recent analysis suggests data center electricity demand projections remain highly uncertain. Inherent bias usually steers toward overestimating the number of facilities that will achieve commercial operation.

As both the digital infrastructure industry and power sector grapple with these challenges, the upcoming Data Center Power Exchange (DPX) Summit on Oct. 28 in Denver offers a critical forum for utilities, grid operators, hyperscalers, and regulators to forge practical solutions. Former FERC Chairman Mark Christie will headline the event and deliver opening remarks, setting the stage for discussions on the power demand question, forecasting algorithms, streamlined interconnection processes, and coordinated investment strategies.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Stock_FERC-Bldg_FERC.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 00:59:36.854077

© UKA, Nordex, Max Bögl Wind- One of the highest-capacity German onshore wind farms is moving into the implementation phase. Approval has been granted, and energy farm developer UKA is now ordering turbines with a total capacity of 140 megawatts from the Nordex Group. At Husum Wind, the parties signed the contracts together with Max Bögl Wind AG, the supplier of the concrete elements for the hybrid towers used in the project.

Husum (renewablepress) - One of the highest-capacity onshore wind farms in Germany shifts into the implementation phase with the Papenburg project. At a public contract signing ceremony at the Husum Wind trade fair today, the order for 20 turbines from Nordex with a total rated capacity of 140 megawatts was signed by Gernot Gauglitz, Managing Partner of the UKA Group, which is responsible for the design of the project. The concrete foundations and concrete parts for the hybrid towers, with a hub height of 164 meters, are supplied by Max Bögl Wind AG.

The wind farm will be constructed on the Mercedes-Benz automobile testing site near Papenburg in Lower Saxony. The corresponding contract was signed as recently as in May 2023, and since then UKA as the energy farm developer has completed both the planning and the approval processes in a very short timeframe.

Prior to signing the contract for the purchase order, Gernot Gauglitz, Managing Partner of the UKA Group, said: “I am proud of the fact that we, as owners of the future wind farm, will be supplying Mercedes-Benz AG with electricity for the next 25 years. This project shows that UKA, which generates its own climate-friendly electricity, is an attractive supplier of electricity even to large industrial corporations. Despite some challenges – for example at the construction site – the project team is pressing ahead with the construction of the wind farm in record time. The wind farm on the Mercedes-Benz testing area is a flagship project in our portfolio of onshore wind farms currently under construction in Germany, representing more than 1.5 GW in total.”

José Luis Blanco, CEO of Nordex Group, said: “We are pleased to be able to continue our existing collaboration with UKA in Germany. We especially appreciate the renewed trust in our technology and our project management at the Papenburg wind farm, particularly given the size and significance of this project for everyone involved.”

Stefan Bögl, CEO of the Max Bögl Group, added: “New plant generations require a stable foundation to ensure operation of the wind farm for two decades. The practical combination of state-of-the-art turbine technology from Nordex and our proven Bögl hybrid tower promises exactly this: The ability to successfully harvest power from wind. We are pleased that, together with UKA and Nordex, we are part of this major project and are thus working together to drive forward the expansion of wind power in Germany.”

Jörg Burzer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, responsible for Production, Quality and Supply Chain Management: “The wind farm in Papenburg is an important building block of our sustainable business strategy - from an ecological and also an economic perspective. The start of construction impressively illustrates that we are consistently putting our ambitious sustainability goals for the production network into practice and thus achieving a measurable impact. We are pleased with the great progress made and are proud as Mercedes-Benz, together with our strong partners, to expand the use of wind energy in Germany with the new wind farm in Papenburg.”

If everything goes according to plan, the first turbines will begin operation on a trial basis by as early as 2027. Once fully commissioned, the wind farm will cover about 20 percent of the annual electricity needs of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in Germany. When it is completed, it will be one of the largest onshore wind farms in Germany, with an electricity generation capacity of about 140 megawatts. The electricity supply contract was concluded for a term of at least 25 years from the start of delivery. The planned wind farm is part of energy farm developer UKA’s extensive 11-gigawatt project pipeline in Germany.

The project will involve 20 turbines from German manufacturer Nordex (N163/6.X), each with a capacity of 7 MW. The concrete foundations and concrete parts for the hybrid towers at the wind farm, with a hub height of 164 meters, are manufactured and installed by Max Bögl Wind AG.

“We’ve never produced more energy than we’re producing now, but Americans’ energy bills are up over 35%,” EQT Corp. Chief Executive Officer Toby Rice said Thursday at BloombergNEF’s Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI summit in Houston. “That’s the catalyst that’s going to get people asking questions.”

High Power Bills to Drive Energy Development, EQT Says Back to video

Article content

Rice and other panelists including Chris James, founder and chief investment officer of investment firm Engine No. 1 LP, and Cynthia Hansen, head of gas transmission and midstream at Enbridge Inc., see developing more infrastructure, particularly natural gas, as the way to bring down utility bills as well as meet demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence.

Article content

States such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Louisiana and Texas are well positioned to add more gas infrastructure as interest from data center developers increases because of abundant supply and friendly regulatory environment, Hansen said. “It’s your supply as well as your permitting and your ability to build out,” Hansen added.

In the short term, low prices stand to squeeze some gas producers as they try to meet demand growth from liquefied natural gas exports and AI power loads and build more infrastructure.

Article content

“In the US, we believe the marginal producer is going to need around $3.50 gas price to break even,” Rice said. To generate a 10% return on enterprise value, “marginal cost of supply is going to need gas between $4 to $5 to justify the activity that’s coming out here,” Rice added.

National Grid is undertaking a 28-day statutory pre-application consultation, ahead of submitting four planning applications to both Gwynedd Council and Eryri National Park Authority.

Today, Thursday 18 September, National Grid begins four pre-application consultations on proposals to reinforce and refurbish the existing electricity network between Pentir and Trawsfynydd. The consultations are open until Wednesday 15 October.

The way electricity is generated in the UK is changing rapidly to a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system for the future. To meet rising energy demand National Grid needs to reinforce and refurbish the existing electricity network between Pentir and Trawsfynydd in North Wales. These upgrades will help relieve pressure on the existing network, support the Welsh government’s energy security and clean power goals, and reduce constraint costs - which are the extra costs added to bills when there is not enough grid capacity to move power where it is needed.

The project is part of the Great Grid Upgrade, the largest overhaul of the electricity grid in generations, and will help keep the network secure and resilient by enabling more clean energy to be delivered to homes and businesses.

The consultations follow a series of public information events National Grid held in May, which gave local people an early opportunity to see its plans, ask questions and meet the project team.

Suzanne Crouch, Portfolio Director for Pentir to Trawsfynydd, said:

“We will take into consideration the feedback received during this pre-application consultation to help refine our proposals before submitting our planning applications to Cyngor Gwynedd and Eryri National Park later this year.

“To meet rising electricity demand and allow new sources of clean, home-grown energy to reach homes and businesses, we need to reinforce and refurbish the existing electricity network between Pentir and Trawsfynydd. This will help to make our energy supply more secure, independent and deliver long-term benefits to bill payers.”

The statutory 28-day consultations give consultees the opportunity to feedback on the draft planning applications for the following four main elements of the project:

Installing new and replacement underground cables and other equipment within the existing substation site at Pentir

Replacing 5.8km of underground cables that run beneath the Glaslyn Estuary at Porthmadog from Wern to Minffordd

Constructing a new substation south of Bryncir

Installing new and replacement underground cables and other equipment within the existing substation site at Trawsfynydd.

Notices with information about the consultations are also being displayed on the application sites, and the draft applications are available to view on the National Grid website at www.nationalgrid.com/Pentir-Trawsfynydd

Following consultation National Grid will carefully consider the comments received as it finalises its planning applications, prior to submission to Cyngor Gwynedd and Eryri National Park Authority later this year.

Under the CWA, Michigan has assumed responsibility for the day-to-day protection, management and restoration of wetlands.
We must have a comprehensive, national approach to clean water protection.","This summer has been marked by severe flooding across our country, from New Mexicoto New York City to North Carolina to Texas, where a devastating flash flood killed more than 130people, including 37 children.

This year, the U.S. has seen reports of flooding double the average over the last two decades, and flood deaths last year were well above the 25-year average. As climate change worsens and FEMA is gutted, we are likely to see even more severe floods and even worse devastating impacts that destroy more homes and claim more lives.

Fortunately, there’s a natural solution right around us that helps offset some of the worst andmost devastating consequences of severe events -- our wetlands. Wetlands are criticallyecologically important. They purify polluted waters, provide habitats for fish and wildlife andcombat erosion.

They also act as natural sponges: during periods of intense rainfall, wetland soil can absorb, trap and then slowly release excess water over time. One acre of wetlands can store as much as 1.5 million gallons of floodwater with no human intervention; man-made barriers with similar capacities would require expensive construction and extensive maintenance. As a result, wetlands play a vital role in mitigating the severity of flooding. One acre of wetland can help avert roughly $745 in flood damage.

In Michigan, wetlands provide $4.77 billion in flood mitigation benefits annually, and between $68 billion and $159 billion in long-term flood protection benefits. Our wetlands also attract tourism, provide opportunities for recreation and support our fishing and agricultural industries. Protecting them is good economic sense, and it should be a top priority.

However, widespread development across Michigan and nationwide is eroding our wetlands.When wetlands are filled in, drained or paved over with impermeable asphalt and concrete, theground can no longer absorb excess water, and flooding becomes more severe.

Since European settlement, Michigan has lost nearly 50% of its original wetlands. Along the Detroit River,almost 90% have been lost. This environmental degradation limits our state’s ability to withstandextreme weather events and to protect our coastal communities.

For nearly 50 years, the Clean Water Act (CWA) served as an invaluable tool that empowered thefederal and state governments to safeguard and restore America’s waters and wetlands. But overtime, the Supreme Court has eroded this landmark legislation. As a result, our nation has apatchwork of laws that are not based on science, while simultaneously failing to improve areaswhere the CWA fell short, such as providing clear, expeditious permits.

Fortunately, despite devastating loss of wetland acres, Michigan now has a comprehensive set ofprograms to protect our waters and wetlands. The state has opted to oversee its day-to-daywetlands management, an authority provided under the CWA. By doing so, Michiganhas demonstrated how states can lead in protecting clean water even under a weakened federalframework.

Under the CWA, Michigan has assumed responsibility for the day-to-day protection, management and restoration of wetlands. This has benefited the state's environment and public health through flood and storm control; protection of subsurface water resources and groundwater recharge; pollution treatment; erosion prevention and nutrient cycling.

However, not all states have followed this proactive approach and exercised their CWA right. Since water does not recognize state boundaries, Michiganians remain at risk when upstream states fail to do their part in protection. We must have a comprehensive, national approach to clean water protection.

In Congress, I have introduced legislation to help other states follow Michigan’s lead. The Federal-State Partnership for Clean Water Act would establish a grant program to financially assist other states, tribes and localities in protecting, managing or restoring their wetlands, including by overseeing their own wetlands programs, just as Michigan does.

It would provide up to $300 million over four years to participant entities so that they can implementcomprehensive plans to protect and restore their wetlands. It is the first step in the right directionto safeguard our waters and help prevent the devastation of extreme, unmitigated flooding.

Protecting our wetlands protects us. By minimizing the impact of extreme natural disasters, wesave both money and lives. This legislation is an invaluable investment in our communities, ourenvironment and our future.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding” provided a legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Through Sept. 22, the agency is collecting public comments on its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding.

Stanford research shows scientific evidence for greenhouse gases’ damaging effects on people’s health, coastal flooding, and other areas has grown stronger over time.

A key part of the federal government’s legal authority to regulate emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources could soon disappear. September 22 is the deadline for public comment on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal to do away with the endangerment finding. Research by Stanford environmental scientist Chris Field and colleagues shows evidence for climate change’s damaging impacts – such as food insecurity, mass migration, and health problems – has only grown since the finding was established.

“The endangerment finding is the foundation for regulation of greenhouse gases at the federal level,” Field said. “It is not the government’s only tool for tackling climate change, but it is key to a balanced program with both carrots and sticks.”

Here are five things to know about the endangerment finding:

1. The endangerment finding identifies six greenhouse gases as a danger under the Clean Air Act.

In 2009, the EPA issued the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act – otherwise known as the endangerment finding. Citing a massive body of scientific evidence, the finding singled out six greenhouse gases for the danger they pose to public health and welfare:

· Carbon dioxide

· Methane

· Nitrous oxide

· Hydrofluorocarbons

· Perfluorocarbons

· Sulfur hexafluoride

2. Courts have upheld the finding, which underpins federal limits on climate pollution.

The finding has its origins in a 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA , in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Because the EPA is required to set limits for damaging pollutants, the court directed the agency to determine whether these gases endanger public health and welfare. The EPA conclusion that six greenhouse gases meet this endangerment criteria unlocked the agency’s authority to regulate emissions from cars, trucks, and power plants. Although industry groups challenged the finding, a district court upheld it, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review it. Since then, the finding has provided the legal foundation for federal climate action.

3. Regulatory signals influence consumer choices and corporate investment.

The endangerment finding not only enables regulations but makes clear that the U.S. government is serious about cutting emissions, according to Field.

“It provides an indication that dealing with climate change is important for individuals when they think about a vehicle purchase or home heating system,” Field said. “It also sends a clear market signal. When companies know the government is serious about cutting emissions, they invest in innovation– better vehicles, cleaner fuels, more efficient appliances. That kind of policy certainty drives progress.”

4. Evidence of climate-related health and welfare risks in the United States has strengthened since 2009.

Since 2009, the scientific evidence for endangerment has only strengthened, according to Stanford research that finds climate change is driving more severe heat waves, larger wildfires and more wildfire smoke-related deaths, rising seas, growing food insecurity, and a range of health problems.

Together with Stanford climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh and Woods Hole Research Center president Philip Duffy, Field led a 2018 study showing that since the endangerment finding was established, scientific evidence has increased “dramatically” for each climate change impact noted in the endangerment finding. Those areas ranged from increased disease rates to coastal flooding in the original report. The 2018 study added to the list of understood negative impacts in the U.S. to include increased dangers from ocean acidification, effects on national security and economic well-being, and threats from violence.

A 2019 study Field coauthored estimated climate change had influenced as much as 20% of armed conflict risk over previous last century, and that the influence would likely increase significantly.

Most recently, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine put out a report

Sept 17 revisiting evidence for health threats from greenhouse gases, and declaring that the basis for the endangerment finding has “stood the test of time.” Michele Barry, the senior associate dean of global health in the Stanford School of Medicine, was on the committee that issued the report.

5. Higher emissions raise risks in the U.S. and abroad.

Without the endangerment finding, the U.S. would have fewer tools to curb emissions, leaving Americans more exposed to climate damages, according to Field. That could mean more cases of asthma and heart disease linked to poor air quality, higher food prices from climate-stressed crops, and economic losses as U.S. companies fall behind in global clean-tech markets.

Among other economic impacts of eliminating the endangerment finding, U.S. automakers could lose their edge, Field said. “Taking the foot off the accelerator on developing compelling electric vehicle options means the best ones will be Chinese vehicles, and American carmakers will struggle to compete,” he said. “In the long run, it's clear what direction the world is headed, and it's clear that U.S. companies are already falling behind.”

The impacts would not stop at America’s borders, according to Field: climate instability abroad could lead to a host of impacts in the U.S., including increased conflict and disruptions in trade with other countries. “A world with massive amounts of climate change is going to have millions of climate migrants. It's going to have regional conflicts driven by climate change, terrible conditions for markets for U.S. goods or suppliers of raw materials, and conflicts that eventually reach our shores or involve our forces. We ignore global impacts at our peril.”",https://woods.stanford.edu/sites/woods/files/styles/large/public/media/image/hartmut_kosig_istock_0.jpg?itok=GJu1JMdE,N,,2025-09-18 23:00:21.010213

Pilcher, Vanessa Miller",,,,,https://www.thegazette.com/environment-nature/iowa-is-at-risk-of-losing-most-of-its-water-quality-sensors-heres-why-that-matters/,"IOWA CITY — Time has run out on a short-term plan to continue funding a network of sensors that monitors the water quality in Iowa’s rivers and streams.
The Iowa Water Quality Information System — or Iowa WQIS — combines data from sensors deployed by the University of Iowa, U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The Iowa WQIS network has water sensors deployed throughout the state, working all day, every day to measure nitrate and phosphorus in the water.
“The current interest in the Office of Water at EPA is not interested in water quality monitoring in Iowa,” Weber said.
“We need more information about Iowa water quality, not less.","IOWA CITY — Time has run out on a short-term plan to continue funding a network of sensors that monitors the water quality in Iowa’s rivers and streams. Unless new funding can be secured, dozens of sensors will be taken offline next year, eliminating the ability to measure nitrate and phosphorus to see if conservation practices are working.

The Iowa Water Quality Information System — or Iowa WQIS — combines data from sensors deployed by the University of Iowa, U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The UI sensors have been funded by Iowa State University’s Nutrient Research Center. In 2023, the UI sensor network received $375,000 from ISU, with a commitment to increase that funding to $500,000.

However, in May of that year, the Iowa Legislature passed and Gov. Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 558, a budget bill for agriculture, natural resources and environmental protection. The bill, among other things, shifted $500,000 — one-third of the ISU Center’s previous state appropriation of about $1.5 million — to a water quality program in the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.

Rather than back out of its commitment to allocate money to UI and the WQIS, Nutrient Center leadership announced they would take on some of the losses at ISU rather than zero out support for the sensors.

Larry Weber, director of hydroscience and engineering in the College of Engineering at UI, said the state budget cut reduced funding to the sensor program and, as a result, fewer sensors are being deployed.

In 2024, the number of UI sensors was reduced from 75 to 65, and this year it’s down to 60.

“Then next year, if we did not find replacement funds by the first of July (2026), then we'll pull all of the sensors out, and we'll go from 75 to 65 to zero,” Weber said.

If the university’s portion of the WQIS network is cut, Weber said the USGS sensors still will be deployed because they’re operated by the federal agency.

Tom Stoeffler, an environmental field associate with the IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering Department at the University of Iowa, said the USDA sensors likely would remain deployed as well.

How does the sensor program work?

The Iowa WQIS network has water sensors deployed throughout the state, working all day, every day to measure nitrate and phosphorus in the water. Readings are taken every five minutes, and the senors send their data to the database every 15 minutes.

“So, you're getting as close to real-time,” Stoeffler said.

Stoeffler said real-time measurements of nitrate levels is helpful, especially during rain events, because researchers can measure upticks of nitrate from runoff and see how the nitrate is moving through the water.

Jordan Barnett, an environmental research assistant with IIHR, said there is a sensor in every main Iowa river that goes into the Missouri or Mississippi rivers.

Stoeffler said some of the sensors remain in the water year-round, but most are removed during the winter months.

“It's when the ice breaks up in the spring and starts going down, it starts tearing sensors,” he said.

The sensor at Waterworks Prairie Park in Iowa City, near the University of Iowa campus, is deployed all year. Stoeffler said that’s because the Coralville dam upstream from the site keeps the water in the river from freezing.

He said the sensors are powered by a 12-volt battery and a 20-watt solar panel near the river’s bank.

Marty St. Clair, research scientist with UI’s IIHR — Hydroscience and Engineering Department, said each winter the sensors are taken back to their manufacturer to be recalibrated and rehabilitated. That annual upkeep costs about $1,200 per sensor.

Looking for a new funding pool

Weber said his team needs to raise about $600,000 annually to continue the program.

“We're living in an inflationary economy, the costs of everything are going up,” he said.

He added that some sensors need to be replaced, and other equipment needs to be upgraded too.

But the biggest expense is staffing, Weber said.

Taking sensors out of the rivers and streams, fixing them for the next year, and redeploying them takes a significant amount of time since the sensors are scatters throughout the state.

“Then all summer long we're going out and taking grab samples at the sensor location sites and doing analysis to make sure that the sensors are reporting accurately,” Weber said.

Weber said he and his team have a “no stone unturned approach” to finding a funding source to keep the network of sensors deployed, but they’re finding that cuts to federal spending have affected funders’ ability and willingness to fund a water quality project.

“There are other foundations and other private individuals that could support things like this, but in I would say all conversations with those foundations or those individuals, there's so much pressure on our social system today that they're finding the need to help support families, with food assistance needs, perhaps with immigration issues and help support families with health issues and medical needs,” Weber said. “When we think about something like a water sensor network, they don't want to fund something that should be the responsibility of our state or federal government.”

Representatives of WQIS also have met with an official from the EPA. Weber said they spoke with Bruno Pigott, who was acting administrator of the Office of Water for the Environmental Protection Agency last year.

“We told him about the network, the importance of it, the value of it, and asked him very directly, ‘Mr. Pigott, we need your help,’” Weber said.

Pigott’s EPA appointment was under former President Joe Biden’s administration. He was not reappointed under the Trump administration.

“The current interest in the Office of Water at EPA is not interested in water quality monitoring in Iowa,” Weber said.

Impacts of the shrinking program

Colleen Fowle, water program director with the Iowa Environmental Council, said if UI’s portion of the water sensors network disappears, there will be fewer data points throughout the state.

“We need more information about Iowa water quality, not less. The decision to remove funding from a critically important monitoring system is shortsighted and it hurts all Iowans by reducing access to information that has big implications on our public health,” Fowle said. “Why would Iowa ever want to reduce or remove residents’ access to data about the quality and safety of their own water?”

Fowle said the cuts come at a time when the public is “demanding more accountability for water quality” across the state.

“Water monitoring is the very first step in determining the source and scale of pollution,” she said. “Defunding the water sensor system conceals this information from the public. Iowans deserve to know what is in our water.”

St. Clair, at IIHR, said while some Iowans may dig through water quality databases on their own, the network has been “the most visible way people can in one glance” see what the nitrate levels are in their area.

When you look at the map you “see the red, yellow, green, and can get some sense immediately of what's going on with respect to nitrate in the state,” St. Clair said. “I occasionally get emails from people in public just saying, ‘Thank you, but is there any way we could get a sensor in our area?’ And it's like, well, I wish we could because I feel like the public deserves to know what's going on in their surface waters.”

Approximately 120 staff members will be laid off, including 75 based in North Carolina, where RTI has approximately 2,000 employees. Workers were notified Thursday and will lose their jobs by early October. RTI has about 6,000 employees working in 90 countries around the world.

RTI International has already cut about 500 jobs since March. That month it announced 340 U.S.-based layoffs, including 177 in North Carolina. In February, RTI announced “temporary layoffs of 226 U.S.-based workers, including 61 in North Carolina. RTI also filed a Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) with the state Department of Commerce in March, announcing 276 job cuts in Durham, although those losses were part of the other job cuts.

RTI’s plans announced Thursday are “the next step in implementing our plan to adapt the institute for long-term strength and growth,” according to the release.

“RTI’s next chapter will demand bold thinking and strategic agility. We’re realigning our organization to lead with greater speed, enhanced collaboration, and tightened client focus, while ensuring that our scientific impact is amplified. We’ve got lots of new leaders in expanded roles and are creating new opportunities for our staff to thrive. I’m as optimistic as I’ve even been about RTI’s future,” RTI’s President and CEO Tim J. Gabel said in a statement.

The nonprofit research institute was formed in 1958 to promote research from the Triangle’s three major universities, Duke, UNC Chapel Hill and NC State. It was the first employer at Research Triangle Park, which is split between Durham and Wake counties.

Though initially a North Carolina-driven institution, the group has become heavily reliant on federal funding, including about 84% of its revenue in 2022 and 2023. RTI International received about $2.3 billion from the federal US Agency for International Development, or USAID, for nonmilitary foreign assistance between 2013 and 2022, the sixth most among all organizations, the News & Observer of Raleigh has reported.

That heavy reliance on federal funding made it vulnerable to cost-cutting efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency, which had been led by Elon Musk at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.

Staff changes include three senior leaders taking on new roles effective Oct. 1. Those changes are:

Angela Quick was named leader and senior vice president for the new Solutions unit, which will be tasked with solving complex client challenges. Quick joined RTI in 2016 and currently leads the Education Practice Area

Nicole Barnes was named leader and senior vice president for the new Growth unit, which will lead business expansion in the public and commercial sectors. Barnes has been with RTI for 22 years, most recently leading the Sustainable Growth and Resilience unit as a municipal finance adviser.

Eric Otto Johnson will provide strategic scientific leadership to advance research excellence as Chief Science Officer. Johnson joined RTI in 2006, most recently serving as chair of the RTI Fellow Program.

The reorganization aims to help RTI deliver science-based value while expanding into new markets; engage clients proactively; and use modern technology to enhance the speed and effectiveness of its projects , according to the release.

Nationally, data centers totaling 5,242.5 megawatts were under construction in the first half of the year, down 17.4 percent from 6,350.1 megawatts in 2024, according to the brokerage.

Data center investments fell by more than half in the first six months of 2025 to less than $1 billion, CBRE reported.

“This slowdown was largely the result of delayed decision-making by investors due to economic uncertainty, geopolitical conflicts and power supply challenges,” the brokerage stated.

Companies including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services have paused or slowed their data center growth this year, while other large operators continue to expand.

Despite the constraints, demand remains strong, said Kristin Hammond, a CBRE senior vice president and broker based in Portland, Oregon.

“The infrastructure has now been outpaced by the construction of facilities,” she said. “There’s no use to having the facility if you don’t have the power poles to service it.”

The Twin Cities is among the markets seeing growth for data center operators, in part due to power and land availability, according to John McWilliams, head of Data Center Insights at Cushman & Wakefield.

Minneapolis had 65.1 megawatts of data center inventory in the first half of the year, per the CBRE data. Northern Virginia remains by far the nation’s largest data center market.

Only two data center projects, including Meta’s 140-megawatt effort in Rosemount, are currently under construction, but more than 701 megawatts are in the planning stages, according to a Cushman & Wakefield report.

The development pipeline includes projects in Rosemount, Chaska, Farmington, Shakopee, Apple Valley, Brooklyn Park and Cannon Falls, said John McWilliams, head of Data Center Insights at Cushman & Wakefield and the author of the report.

Net absorption in the first half of the year totaled 13.2 megawatts in the Minneapolis market.

Oregon remains a popular destination for data center operators, in part due to geography, relatively cheap energy and a skilled high-tech construction workforce.

Increasingly, Oregon subcontractors are being sought for data center projects in other states, said Gabe Fox, chief estimator for Mortenson in Portland.

“We have a really strong labor force that’s highly technical, which is not always the same in other markets,” he said. “We have some of the best sheet metal companies and electrical companies here in the Northwest. These companies are being sought after to bring their expertise. … They’re definitely staying busy.”

In addition to contractors’ abilities to build high-tech projects, Portland General Electric’s experience powering semiconductor facilities has given it a leg up in providing electricity to data centers, Hammond said.

“PGE has been very savvy about it,” she said.

PGE is seeking additional energy sources to alleviate the power crunch. The company in 2023 issued a request for proposals for new power sources. Then in September 2024, PGE recommended a list of chosen projects to the Oregon Public Utility Commission. PGE is now working with the bidders to update their pricing following the passage of the federal budget bill.

PGE plans to finalize contracts this year, with projects expected to come into service by the end of 2027, the utility disclosed in July.

PGE CEO and President Maria Pope told investors during a July 25 call that the company is “seeing sustained growth from data center and high-tech customers — over 16% compared to the same quarter last year.”

The Construction Worker Conundrum

This fall, as high school graduates from the Class of 2025 begin college, it’s a reminder that the share of students pursuing higher education has crept steadily upward for more than two generations—driven by the deeply ingrained belief, however outdated, that the only path to a meaningful career and middle-class security runs through the halls of academia.

Today, more business leaders, government officials, and students are recognizing that this is not the case. While a degree is essential for certain professions, the college-or-bust mentality has discouraged students from seeking alternatives that are equally vital to the health of our nation—namely the skilled trades. From my vantage point in the construction industry, this mindset shift couldn’t come at a better time, as the demand for new infrastructure has never been greater.

No Progress Without Builders

Every major technological invention, breakthrough, and leap in human progress starts with the people who build the infrastructure behind it. For example, as recent headlines make clear, artificial intelligence (AI) promises unprecedented productivity gains and life-saving breakthroughs—but only if we can build and power the data centers that drive it. That means more electrical power assets, more semiconductor factories, more transportation systems, more critical minerals for electrification, and more supporting infrastructure—all of which rely on assets built from concrete, steel, pipe, equipment, cables, and so on.

Without enough tradespeople, these mission-critical projects could face lengthy delays or fail to get off the ground at all. Rebuilding America’s construction workforce is no longer optional—it’s a national imperative.

At Bechtel, we’ve long recognized this, investing in changing perceptions of the industry and reigniting interest in the trades. And as the need for construction workers grows, we’re proud to share some of the ways we’re bringing more people into the fold.

Restoring Prestige to the Profession by Supporting Workers

Since time immemorial, builders have made life as we know it possible. They’ve turned scientists’ and engineers’ boldest ideas into physical realities—from the Roman aqueducts to the Hoover Dam, the interstate highway system, and even the internet.

By that logic, construction workers deserve the same respect we extend to military service members, first responders, or today’s top innovators for their contributions to society. Yet too often, the opposite has been true.

For decades construction work has been characterized as low-skilled, low-paid work—“a consolation” for those without college degrees. That view belongs to a bygone era.

Today’s reality is very different—and it must be recognized as such. At Bechtel, we make sure our culture reflects that. We call our builders “craft professionals,” because that’s exactly what they are: highly skilled experts who are as critical to our success as our engineers and project managers. They are the heart of our business, and we acknowledge that by embedding them into every part of our company.

Making Construction a Career of Choice

Advances in technology and the advent of much-needed regulations have made construction work safer, more productive, and more interesting—not to mention lucrative. Take welding: highly skilled welders at the beginning of their careers can earn $100,000 annually—without the crushing burden of student debt that weighs down so many of their college-graduate peers.

To that end, we make sure our construction jobs aren’t just jobs, but careers on which people can support their families. That means offering competitive wages, advanced training, robust benefits, paid vacation, and clear advancement pathways. It’s worth noting that as AI threatens to upend knowledge work, the stability of a career in construction will become an even stronger selling point.

Of course, construction, while safe, is demanding work with stressors that differ from office jobs. If the industry wants more workers, we must be more mindful in caring for their physical and mental health. That’s why Bechtel has made mental health a core part of our broader safety program. Not only do we prioritize safety and wellbeing above all, but we believe mental health belongs under the umbrella of workplace safety across our industry—and every industry.

We’ve seen these efforts pay off. Bechtel has been able to avoid many of the labor constraints plaguing the industry. We currently have more than 15,000 craft professionals working on our LNG projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast—proof that when good opportunities arise, people seize them.

Maximizing the Construction Talent Pool

To increase the construction workforce nationally—and on a timeline that meets the urgency of the moment—we must widen the pool of potential American talent. Failure to do so risks irrevocably weakening our industrial base. Worse yet, we’ll see more foreign firms, with foreign workers in tow, trying to compete for construction projects on American soil—which will only serve to stunt the U.S. labor force, as well as the local economies that depend on these jobs.

The claim that there simply aren’t enough American construction workers is a convenient excuse. Bechtel has shown otherwise. Granted, foreign labor—when it’s legal and deployed sparingly as a stopgap—is sometimes necessary. But the real solution is to work with communities, unions, and other partners to highlight career opportunities in construction and equip people with the skills they need to fill these roles.

At Bechtel, we’ve found success partnering with local high schools and colleges to create pathways into construction through training programs. We’ve also teamed up with organizations that connect with local workers and underrepresented groups. For instance, at Plant Vogtle, we partnered with the National Building Trades Unions to bring on apprentices and with the nonprofit Helmets to Hardhats to attract veterans. In the end, more than 30% of our hires were veterans and reservists, and over 40% of our apprentices were women.

Outreach to women is particularly important when you consider that, in the U.S., women comprise nearly 50 percent of the workforce but hold just 4 percent of construction jobs. Attracting new workers to the profession becomes a lot harder if we only draw from half the adult population.

The education sector has a role to play, too. Beginning in 2026, Pell Grants will cover vocational training, hopefully spurring more interest among prospective students. The next challenge is ensuring high schools, community colleges, and industry partners have the capacity to create strong vocational programs that prepare the next generation of builders. Here too, it’s incumbent on companies within our industry to broker partnerships and collaborations across these institutions.

Improving How Construction Projects Are Delivered

Contrary to popular belief, construction is far from a stagnant profession. While studies note its productivity hasn’t risen as quickly as other industries, that view misses the real story.

Continuous innovation and investment have improved the whole construction ecosystem. Environmental and social requirements run through the entire value chain, while quality standards and material traceability are central to today’s construction practice. Combined with increased safety standards, all of these improvements have increased the value of what construction delivers while steadily raising productivity.

Industry analysts also tend to separate the productivity of construction from the productivity that construction enables. Construction drives massive gains across the entire economy—building the factories, power plants, and data centers that make breakthroughs possible.

To keep pace with America’s needs, Bechtel is pushing the industry forward by embracing tools like digital delivery, modularization, real-time data analytics, and yes, AI. This not only makes construction more rewarding and exciting for young people—it unlocks growth for the nation as a whole.

Securing America’s Future, One Builder at a Time

So much of our future quite literally rests on concrete, steel, pipe, and wire—and on the men and women with the skills to turn those raw materials into infrastructure. Construction workers have always risen to the occasion. As technology, regulations, and ways of working have changed, they’ve improved safety, quality, and productivity in turn.

As millions of American students return to school and begin to envision a career, Bechtel will continue to ensure they know that construction can be one of the brightest paths forward. By becoming builders, they secure their own future—and our nation’s.

My hope is that Americans reconsider their own perceptions of the construction field and the people who choose to join it. As society evolves to see vocational training and the trades as integral to our shared success, more people—including prospective workers—will view this profession for what it is: shaping the world on the grandest scale and in millions of small ways that make ordinary life better.

The Texas Climate Jobs Project released a new report that shows ways Austin could create hundreds of local jobs and save millions in energy costs by decarbonizing buildings.

The report states that ""buildings currently account for 40% of [carbon] emissions and energy costs worldwide."" By installing solar panels to 104 city-owned buildings, it could significantly alleviate those two factors and save up to $4.42 million in annual savings.

Another avenue that's being explored is investing in projects like HVAC repairs, pipe replacements and window upgrades. According to the report, those upgrades could save the facilities between $1.63 and $2.87 million every year.

""Unfortunately, energy is becoming more expensive,"" said Jeremy Hendricks, Secretary Treasurer of Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA) Local 1095. ""We're having rolling blackouts in really high demand days, and this is really is a way to supplement that energy usage and make sure that we're saving money at a time when the state is constricting the city's ability to really raise revenue.""

The project would also create 303 local jobs through a union contract.

During a tour Thursday, KVUE was welcomed into the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers [IBEW Local 520], to get a first-hand look at the facility where workers would train to be part of the projects.

""We are ready to provide the city with the best highly skilled craftspeople available,"" said IBEW Local 520 business manager Ben Brenneman. ""Our workers have more issues with heat stress; it becomes more dangerous every year; we all know it's happening and something needs to be done.""

Council Member Ryan Alter said they hope to get as many panels on city buildings in 2026. However, the cost of getting them on could be a problem as the city deals with federal funding cuts and a tight budget.

""This will be millions of dollars in investments in the actual panels themselves, but that will be fully recouped within six or seven years,"" said Alter.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/KVUE/images/7cf84505-7fdf-4d67-9b8d-793a6185a9be/20250918T232442/7cf84505-7fdf-4d67-9b8d-793a6185a9be_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:33.149953

I reached out to Kates-Garnick after I reported on the circumstances surrounding a major solar project cancellation in the Western Massachusetts town of Shutesbury, which I believe was indicative of the weakening hand developers have in conflicts with activists on the ground. I sought to best understand how folks enmeshed in the state’s decarbonization goals felt about what was happening to local renewables development in light of the de facto repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean electricity tax credit.

Of course, like anyone in Massachusetts, Kates-Garnick was blunt about the situation: it’s quite bad.

The following conversation was lightly edited for clarity.

So to start, how do you feel about the state’s odds of meeting its climate goals?

My own assumption is that it was going to be tough before all of the federal changes to meet those goals. They were highly ambitious and I really support the ambition, but now it’s going to be really, really difficult to meet the clean energy goals. It’s not that we shouldn't work hard to meet them but we have to understand that in this current state of affairs, the obstacles are going to be much greater. But when you take offshore wind off the table, the challenge becomes even more enormous.

Why is offshore wind necessary to meet the state’s climate targets?

It’s because it is a large resource that would be coming into the grid over a period of time. The significance is in the megawatts, the size and scale. It was particularly important and we’re land constrained in New England. And all of the sudden you’re taking such a large opportunity in generation off the table.

We can do energy efficiency and we can do solar but as you know from the Shutesbury situation, land is at a premium. Location – you can’t site onshore wind here. We tried really hard under former Governor Deval Patrick and that hit a lot of obstacles. So offshore wind is critical to meeting those goals.

Help me understand the conflicts over this land constraint – is Shutesbury an aberration or a bit of a tale of the tape of the problems here?

The Shutesbury situation reflects how we’re not a large geographical area. We’re not Texas. We can put solar on roofs but you need larger solar installations. We’ve encouraged the solar industry as much as possible. But the area is limited. Wind off the coast provided an alternative that was realistic and not a science experiment.

How much of this problem is state permitting? It feels like there is some land in a space like Massachusetts but people don’t want to use it for this.

Any time you try to put energy infrastructure into New England – whether it's a gas pipeline or a solar installation – there’s a lot of local environmental and permitting regulations that can really hold up a project. One of the good things Massachusetts has done is we made energy permitting easier and went through a permitting reform. We have an Energy Facility Siting Council.

There’s still ways local interests can hold up projects. I think that’s just a fact of life in New England.

So that’s why offshore wind is so important to New England.

It becomes more challenging. From a resource perspective, we are at the end of the fossil fuel pipeline. The middle Atlantic has more gas pipelines coming into it than we do in New England. Offshore wind represented a great opportunity for us.

With respect to the state permitting, it is possible to now overcome some local regulations in state permitting in ways that weren’t possible before. We did address permitting reform in Massachusetts. The Energy Facility Siting Council has played a great, important role in having that happen and [towns] can be overruled to a certain extent.

Well, but it sounds like what you’re saying is that the conflicts will still exist because land is at a premium?

Yeah. And local control will always play a role in that.

The Commonwealth signed permitting reform into law in 2024 and in that there were comprehensive reforms to the process for clean energy infrastructure. This has improved siting. But again that doesn’t always ensure a project will be permitted and you can easily find ways to hold them up.

What gives you hope for the future? Where’s the light at the end of the tunnel for you?

I think that by facilitating permitting reform and also participation – local participation – as early as possible in the stages of projects… I think this is where the key lies. You can pass regulations but a lot of it has to do with doing the work ahead of time on your project and satisfying the local community so you don’t have a bigger fight on your hands.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTYxMzU5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNTMxOTc0M30.dNUnRzeYLSuKrpitApylBMT-bxMpjuZ5hHbt4yfFaeU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=40%2C0%2C40%2C0,N,,2025-09-19 00:59:32.037099

Since 2009, the Endangerment Finding has required EPA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Its recission would pose a serious threat to public health. Blunt Rochester is a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

“Your recommendation to rescind the Endangerment Finding is in direct conflict with scientific evidence—and puts the health and welfare of our constituents at risk,” wrote the lawmakers. “Without regulating GHG emissions, more Americans will feel the impacts of climate-fueled extreme weather events, increased levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, and a spike in vector-borne diseases.”

Analyses indicate that heavier and more frequent precipitation will increase and threaten Delaware’s nearly $8 billion agriculture industry. Increased storm events and extreme tides are already causing saltwater intrusion, degrading soil quality, and reducing corn and soy yields for Delaware farmers.”

“[The Endangerment Finding’s] rescission will put more communities at risk from environmental and climate-related health threats—and all too often the communities that will suffer the most from these risks are communities already overburdened with environmental harms,” concluded the lawmakers. “Delawareans and all communities, including our future generations, deserve an environment that supports their health and welfare. We urge you to maintain the 2009 Endangerment Finding and protect Delawareans and all communities across the country.”

The Delaware delegation’s full letter can be found here and below:

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We are writing in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to reconsider the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards. For sixteen years, the Endangerment Finding has required EPA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By rescinding the Endangerment Finding, EPA would remove its authority to set standards for GHG emissions, risking public health. We strongly urge you to maintain the 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle standards to protect the public health and welfare of all Delawareans and all communities across the country.

The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to regulate air pollutants that are reasonably “anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”In Massachusetts v. EPA (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court found that GHG emissions are air pollutants under the CAA, and mandated that EPA make a determination on whether GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare, thus requiring regulation. As a response to that mandate, the EPA issued the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which concluded that “elevated concentrations of six greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride—endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” It also found “that the combined emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines” pose a threat to public health and welfare. Supporting the Endangerment Finding was an overwhelming record of scientific evidence that GHG emissions do affect the public health and welfare of Americans by contributing to climate change. Since 2009, federal courts have repeatedly upheld the scientific basis of the Endangerment Finding.

That scientific evidence for the Endangerment Finding continues to grow. Your recommendation to rescind the Endangerment Finding is in direct conflict with scientific evidence—and puts the health and welfare of our constituents at risk. Without regulating GHG emissions, more Americans will feel the impacts of climate-fueled extreme weather events, increased levels of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, and a spike in vector-borne diseases.

Delaware is already feeling the effects of climate change. As the state with the lowest mean elevation, Delaware’s coastline faces extreme risks from sea level rise, a direct result of climate change. Sea levels have risen more than one foot since 1900 and are expected to rise an additional 9 to 23 inches by 2050. By the end of the century, 8 to 11 percent of Delaware could be underwater, including 99 percent of Sussex County’s saltmarshes. Sea level rise and effects of climate change are expected to have a devastating impact on local businesses, especially Delaware’s $4.7 billion tourism industry, and will cause over $69 billion in economic losses for the state by the end of the century. Analyses indicate that heavier and more frequent precipitation will increase and threaten Delaware’s nearly $8 billion agriculture industry. Increased storm events and extreme tides are already causing saltwater intrusion, degrading soil quality, and reducing corn and soy yields for Delaware farmers.

Extreme weather events are occurring at an accelerating rate due to climate change, creating growing safety and health concerns for Delaware residents. In the last five years, Delaware residents have experienced 8 extreme weather events that each caused $1 billion or more in damages, totaling over $110 billion, and led to at least 247 lives lost in the Mid-Atlantic region. Extreme storms and increased precipitation will lead to more flooding, as average precipitation is expected to increase by 10 percent by the next century. While Lewes, Delaware experienced nine days of flooding in 2019, the town is expected to experience between 50 to 135 high tide flood events annually by 2050. It’s not just our coastal communities that are feeling the effects of climate-fueled extreme weather events. During Hurricane Sandy, the Broadkill River surged, flooding local businesses across downtown Milton, Delaware.

In your confirmation hearing, you stated that EPA’s “mission is simple but essential, [it’s] to protect human health and the environment.” Your reported recommendation to rescind the Endangerment Finding is in direct contradiction with this mission. It also negates your commitment to follow the science. Rescinding the Endangerment Finding is not just detrimental to our climate; it is also a threat to public health. For example, experts report that air pollution is harmful and can lead to wheezing and coughing, asthma attacks, and even lung cancer, which leads to increased healthcare costs. Its rescission will put more communities at risk from environmental and climate-related health threats—and all too often the communities that will suffer the most from these risks are communities already overburdened with environmental harms. Delawareans and all communities, including our future generations, deserve an environment that supports their health and welfare. We urge you to maintain the 2009 Endangerment Finding and protect Delawareans and all communities across the country.

Sincerely,

Ford to replace gas-powered SUVs with less expensive, new EV line

By KEVIN WEAKS

With the current administration doing away with tax credits on electric vehicle purchases, it might seem like a head-scratcher why Ford Motor Co. is discontinuing production of two popular gas-powered models to make room for a new line of cheaper EVs, including a midsize pickup that Ford says will be as quick as a Mustang.

Last month Ford announced it would build a new midsize electric truck which is expected to launch in 2027 and cost around $30,000. That’s great news for buyers who are looking for an affordable EV pickup, opines Edmunds.com, but it’s bad news for the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair.

It’s all part of a grand plan that is built on Ford’s $5 billion “Universal EV Production System” which will go online this fall at the company’s production facility in Louisville, Ky., where the Escape and Corsair are currently built and at Ford’s Blue Oval Battery Park in Michigan. The system, which replaces the traditional assembly line with a tree-like arrangement, will simplify the assembly of vehicles built on the company’s new electric vehicle architecture. Production will stop for Escape and Corsair later this year.

Ford is taking a calculated risk that the idea of a relatively inexpensive line of electric vehicles will offset the killing of two popular entry-level models that are still selling well. In fact, the Escape was Ford’s second-best-selling SUV last year. Ford sold 133,324 Escapes in 2024, a 4.2 percent increase in sales compared to 2023. The Lincoln Corsair sold 27,513, a decline from the previous year, but up four percent in first quarter 2025. Both vehicles have stiff competition. The Escape crossover is challenged by the Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and others, while the Corsair competes with luxury class SUVs including the Buick Envision and Cadillac XT4, as well as similarly priced Lexus, Audi and Volvo models.

So you have to wonder if this new line of cheap Ford EVs will dazzle the market so much as to become a game-changer. Ford thinks it will. Meanwhile, buyers looking to get their hands on an Escape or Corsair still have some time.

“We’re going to have enough inventory to sell Escape and Corsair well into 2026,” a Ford spokesperson said, so dealer inventory levels should still be relatively high for the foreseeable future.

Provided its lineup doesn’t change, that means the least-expensive Ford SUVs will be the Bronco Sport and larger Bronco; for Lincoln, that raises the entry point to the brand to the pricier midsize Nautilus. With the exception of the compact Maverick pickup, Ford has been busy removing affordable cars and SUVs from its lineup like the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion and the EcoSport that slotted beneath the Escape.

A “MODEL T MOMENT”

Ford President and CEO Jim Farley recently confirmed that Ford will stop production of the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair after the 2026 model year and gear up for the yet-to-be-named new cheap electric truck and other affordable EVs. Farley called it a “Model T moment.”

“Our Louisville-assembled midsize electric truck on this Universal EV Platform will debut in 2027. It will have a target starting MSRP at about $30,000, roughly the same as the Model T when adjusted for inflation,” Farley said. “As with the Model T, Ford is again betting big on America. In Louisville the reinvention of our company begins in earnest, with the implementation of an innovative manufacturing process to bring this platform to life.”

Ford describes the vehicle as a super affordable, all-electric, hyper-versatile small truck with impressive range that is even capable of powering one’s home in the event of a power outage for up to six days and be quicker than a Mustang EcoBoost from 0 to 60 mph. Ford also notes that it should provide more passenger room than the Toyota RAV4 and offer both a truck bed and a front trunk or “frunk.” According to Farley, it will later adopt various other body styles, including multiple SUVs and maybe even a sedan.

All of this is centered around Ford’s Universal EV platform which will allow Ford to produce vehicles across various segments without massive retooling investments. Both Stellantis and GM have developed scalable EV platforms of their own, so it figures that Ford follows suit. Road and Track magazine says the Blue Oval’s approach will focus on software-defined products, more akin to the likes of Tesla and Rivian.

The platform itself utilizes 20 percent fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, with large uni-castings making up large sections of the cars. The wiring harness for the new vehicles is lighter, for example, which allows Ford to use 25 percent fewer fasteners during production. Even the production line is drastically different. Ford calls it an “assembly tree” as opposed to the traditional assembly setup. In the new paradigm, multiple sections of the vehicle are assembled in parallel before being joined near the end of the process. This means fewer dock-to-dock stops during the assembly process itself, which allows production to move up to 15 percent faster than the current run rate at Louisville Assembly.

Ford Chief EV, Digital, and Design Officer Doug Field even noted that the way the car will be assembled is different, promising that no worker will ever need to contort an entire dashboard or other large interior or powertrain component into a body structure through a door opening again—suggesting that Ford is really looking at changing not only the design, parts sourcing, prototyping and other elements of the vehicle but also upending the way cars have been built for the better part of the last century.

“We transformed the traditional assembly line into a tree with three main branches,” explained Field. “We’ll assemble the front and rear of the vehicle on separate lines. The third branch is the vehicle’s structural battery, which we’ll pre-assemble with seats, consoles, and carpeting. These three branches come together at the end, a process that revolutionizes the factory and simplifies work for our employees.”

A RADICAL APPROACH

So far, Ford hasn’t shown what the new-age Model T will look like beyond some simple line drawings of the truck’s profile, as well as profiles of what appear to be a small SUV, large three-row SUV and a van.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,” said Farley.

Louisville Assembly is slated for a $2.2 billion investment as part of the initiative and is expected to add around 2,200 jobs to support the upcoming electric truck. The investment will also include a 52,000 square-foot expansion of the facility. BlueOval Battery Park will also receive approximately $3 billion to build the new battery packs, with a similar amount of jobs expected to be added.

Henry Ford’s popularization of the moving assembly line at the Highland Park Assembly Plant more than 100 years ago transformed the face of society, but as the auto industry shifts toward an electrified future, new production and development techniques like the Louisville plant will become more common. Ford is hoping to deliver what no other automaker has been able to: a family of affordable, adaptable electric vehicles that offer multiple body styles for work and play — including for export — and whose long-lifespan Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries will be assembled in America, not imported from China.",https://labortribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Yellow-Pickup.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 21:58:55.368844
,EPA,2025-09-18 23:06:20+00:00,Chemical & Engineering News,"National Academies' climate report supports endangerment finding, contradicting EPA",Leigh Krietsch Boerner,,,,,https://cen.acs.org/environment/greenhouse-gases/National-Academies-climate-report-supports/103/web/2025/09,"But according to the NASEM report released yesterday, there’s more evidence of harm now than in 2009, and the evidence is stronger.
In its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, the EPA based its scientific justification largely on a US Department of Energy (DOE) report developed by the Climate Working Group and released July 29.
The DOE report has been highly criticized by climate scientists, who say that its conclusions “are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect.” The DOE report amassed over 59,500 comments during its public comment period, which ended Sept. 2.
Instead of reviewing the DOE report, NASEM announced on Aug. 7 that it would conduct an independent, self-funded report on the climate science published since the endangerment finding’s release in 2009.
What the EPA will do with the NASEM report and the other comments refuting the proposal’s science is unclear, Miller says.","The scientific evidence that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cause harm to human health and welfare “is beyond scientific dispute,” the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) says in a report released Wednesday, directly contradicting statements from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA recently proposed (PDF) to rescind its endangerment finding, a 2009 report that says GHGs endanger human health and welfare and that forms the scientific and legal basis for regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. In speaking about the EPA’s proposal, Administrator Lee Zeldin said that evidence of this harm has weakened or been contradicted based on observations since 2009.

But according to the NASEM report released yesterday, there’s more evidence of harm now than in 2009, and the evidence is stronger. “Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” the report says.

When asked about the scientific discrepancies between the NASEM report and Zeldin’s comments, EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch responded that GHG regulations during the administrations of Barack Obama and Joe Biden cost trillions. “As we saw in the 16 intervening years since the Endangerment Finding was made, many of the extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected,” she says in an email. Hirsch did not respond to C&EN’s repeated attempts at clarification of her statements.

In its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, the EPA based its scientific justification largely on a US Department of Energy (DOE) report developed by the Climate Working Group and released July 29. Brought together by DOE Secretary Chris Wright, the group’s members were five known climate change denialists, including John Christy and Steve Koonin. The DOE report has been highly criticized by climate scientists, who say that its conclusions “are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect.” The DOE report amassed over 59,500 comments during its public comment period, which ended Sept. 2.

Instead of reviewing the DOE report, NASEM announced on Aug. 7 that it would conduct an independent, self-funded report on the climate science published since the endangerment finding’s release in 2009. “The study was undertaken with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA, following its call for public comments, as it considers the status of the endangerment finding,” Shirley Tilghman, professor emeritus in molecular biology at Princeton University and chair of the NASEM report committee, says in a statement. “We are hopeful that the evidence summarized here shows the strong base of scientific evidence available to inform sound decision-making.”

The group submitted the report as a public comment on the EPA’s proposal to rescind the endangerment finding. As of Sept. 18, the EPA’s proposal has elicited over 105,000 comments. The public comment period ends Sept. 22, and the EPA is scheduled to issue the final rule this month.

The NASEM finished its report in roughly the same amount of time as the Climate Working Group, using the same publicly available body of science, says Andy Miller, former senior science adviser for the EPA’s Office of Research and Development. And the difference in the reports is stark, he says. “In essence, the DOE report said there are some things [in the science] that are uncertain, therefore we don’t know enough to do anything,” Miller says. “Whereas the Academies essentially said we know a lot.”

“Perhaps the most important [thing] to note is that the [National Academy of Sciences] process that led to this Consensus Study Report involves an independent review by experts chosen for their technical expertise,” says Melissa Finucane, vice president of science and innovation at the environmental advocacy group the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This is the type of information that policymakers should rely on to make decisions that affect Americans’ health and prosperity.”

The Donald J. Trump administration has since disbanded the Climate Working Group in response to a lawsuit brought by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). The groups claim that by not holding public meetings as it prepared its report, the Climate Working Group violated laws about transparency in federal advisory committees. On Sept. 17, a federal judge ruled that even though the Climate Working Group has been dissolved, the federal transparency laws still apply to the group and its report. Members of the group are continuing to work, the EDF says, citing a news report.

What the EPA will do with the NASEM report and the other comments refuting the proposal’s science is unclear, Miller says. “If EPA is going to reverse a decision that has been based on scientific evidence, then the evidence to reverse that decision needs to be at least as strong as that that was originally cited,” he says. That’s been the practice in government scientific decisions in the past, Miller says. “But who knows what’s going to happen now?”

The Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the Clean Energy Business Network, and the American Chemistry Council all declined to comment for this story. The US Chamber of Commerce did not reply to C&EN’s request for comment.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/National-Academies-of-Science-report-uphold-endangerment-finding---178734:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-09-18 20:02:55.197640

By providing this additional capital, the One North Carolina Small Business Program can improve the trajectory of small businesses and the likelihood of commercializing their innovative solutions.
Additionally, the Matching Program helps attract small businesses to North Carolina, create jobs, and draw more investment to the state.
The One North Carolina Small Business Program is administered by the North Carolina Department of Commerce on behalf of the North Carolina Board of Science, Technology & Innovation.
Since 2006, the One North Carolina Small Business program has awarded a total of nearly $41 million to 510 businesses across the state.","Addressing a well-known gap that many innovative companies face, today the North Carolina Board of Science, Technology & Innovation announced its latest round of funding to small businesses developing and commercializing new technologies in North Carolina. In fiscal year 2024-2025, 90 small businesses in 21 counties received 102 awards from the One North Carolina Small Business Program, providing $4.12 million for innovation in a variety of industries, including pharmaceuticals, energy, advanced materials, and agriculture.

“North Carolina is home to thriving, high-demand sectors, including life sciences and advanced manufacturing, that propel our economy forward,” said Governor Josh Stein. “By supporting small businesses at a critical stage of their growth, these grants help drive job creation and economic prosperity.”

The One North Carolina Small Business Program awards state-funded grants for small businesses that apply for awards from two highly competitive federal initiatives: the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The federal SBIR and STTR programs, collectively referred to as America’s Seed Fund™, are administered through 11 federal agencies to support technology development by small businesses, with the goal of commercialization and economic sustainability for the selected companies. SBIR and STTR are the single largest source of early-stage technology development funding for small businesses across the country, with nearly $4.3 billion awarded annually.

Since 2006, the One North Carolina Small Business Program has leveraged these federal awards to support North Carolina’s innovation ecosystem and help small businesses navigate the early stages of company growth. By providing this additional capital, the One North Carolina Small Business Program can improve the trajectory of small businesses and the likelihood of commercializing their innovative solutions.

The One North Carolina Small Business Program awarded two types of grants during the fiscal year 2025 funding round: Incentive and Matching.

Incentive grants support qualified North Carolina businesses as they prepare and submit an SBIR or STTR proposal to federal agencies, helping to offset some of the costs of developing these complex proposals. The state program aims to improve the quality of proposals, particularly from first-time applicants, and incentivizes broader technology and geographic diversity among North Carolina’s SBIR and STTR applicants. In North Carolina fiscal year 2025, 51 small businesses were awarded Incentive grants totaling $418,863.

If a company is successful in winning a Phase I SBIR or STTR federal award, the Matching Program supplements those federal funds. This supplemental funding helps the company navigate what’s often called the “Valley of Death” – the time from the launch of a business idea to the point that idea generates sustainable revenue. Additionally, the Matching Program helps attract small businesses to North Carolina, create jobs, and draw more investment to the state. In the most recent round of grantmaking, 51 small businesses in 14 North Carolina counties were awarded $3.69 million in Matching grants after receiving $14.2 million in federal funds.

Among the 51 companies awarded Matching grants, 10 are located in more economically distressed Tier 1 or Tier 2 counties. The N.C. Department of Commerce uses the Tier ranking system to designate the economic well-being in each county through a county’s unemployment rate, median household income, population growth, and adjusted property tax per capita. Tier 1 represents the 40 most distressed counties, the next 40 counties make up Tier 2, and the 20 least distressed form Tier 3. By using this Tier ranking system, state programs can focus on economically advancing the lower Tier counties, in this instance through growth of small innovative businesses. Out of the 10 total awards in Tier 1 and Tier 2, three of the awards went to companies in Tier 1 counties – the most to be awarded through the Matching program in a single year.

The One North Carolina Small Business Program is administered by the North Carolina Department of Commerce on behalf of the North Carolina Board of Science, Technology & Innovation.

“At a time when other states and nations are increasing their investments in scientific discovery and technological advancement, we need to continue to develop solutions to our greatest challenges, grow our economy, and boost our competitiveness,” said Sheila Mikhail, Chair of the Board. “By awarding grants to small businesses across the state, we are investing in our greatest natural resource – our innovative human capital – to drive economic vitality and North Carolina’s leadership in the global economy.

Since 2006, the One North Carolina Small Business program has awarded a total of nearly $41 million to 510 businesses across the state. With the support of this early-stage capital, the small, innovative businesses have gone on to maintain more than 2,000 jobs and receive more than $9.6 billion in follow-on funding from other sources to support the innovation economy within North Carolina. Combined, the businesses employ more than 4,000 people, pay $600 million in total wages, and pay per-employee average wages that are twice the state average.",,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:45.385852

GridStor on September 18 announced the acquisition of the 100-MW/400-MWh White Tank battery storage project from Strata Clean Energy, a solar power and energy storage developer based in Durham, North Carolina. Strata, also an independent power producer, has more than 300 projects in its portfolio, including more than 3 GW of its own construction. The company, a group that performs engineering, procurement, construction, along with operations and maintenance, also has more than 7 GW of solar and 21 GWh of storage in development.

GridStor on Thursday noted that the acquisition, and plans to build more standalone battery storage in Arizona, come as the state experiences rapid demand growth. APS and other utilities in the state set all-time records for peak power demand in August of this year.

The White Tank project also has a battery supply agreement and long-term service agreement with e-STORAGE, a Tier 1 global provider of energy storage solutions. That company, part of Canadian Solar, is providing about 120 of its SolBank 3.0 battery enclosures for the project, according to an announcement earlier this year.

20-Year Tolling Agreement

The White Tank project will be operated via a 20-year tolling agreement with APS, which is Arizona’s largest electric utility and which serves about 1.4 million homes and businesses. The project is sited in Maricopa County. White Tank is expected to enter commercial operation in the first half of 2027. Strata will continue to serve in a consulting role for the project during construction.

“Through this acquisition, GridStor is proud to extend our commitment to supporting Arizona utilities to meet the fast-growing power needs of their residents and businesses,” said Chris Taylor, CEO of GridStor and a former energy executive with Google. “Battery storage remains a highly scalable, cost-effective and near-term solution to powering rapidly growing energy capacity needs across the Southwest. We look forward to serving as a trusted partner to APS to meet the needs of Arizona’s residents and businesses.”

The White Tank battery storage project under its tolling agreement will allow APS to charge and discharge electricity as needed, helping to ensure customers have access to power when they need it and supporting the region’s expanding population and new industrial facilities.

“Strata is proud to play a foundational role in advancing Arizona’s clean energy infrastructure,” said Markus Wilhelm, CEO of Strata Clean Energy. “The White Tank project reflects our commitment to delivering grid-scale solutions that support utility partners like APS in meeting rising demand with reliability and resilience.”

The successful close of the project marks GridStor’s fourth acquisition within the past year, and its second in Arizona.

With respect to the state permitting, it is possible to now overcome some local regulations in state permitting in ways that weren’t possible before.
Not to mention Texas is a major hub for battery storage development, second only to California in total capacity installed onto the grid.
And while Garcia was stymied from halting that individual battery project, he then tried to block the Energy Department from streamlining federal permits for the entire battery storage system sector.
This is resulting in percolating Republican ire against battery storage, point blank.","The following conversation was lightly edited for clarity.

So to start, how do you feel about the state’s odds of meeting its climate goals?

My own assumption is that it was going to be tough before all of the federal changes to meet those goals. They were highly ambitious and I really support the ambition, but now it’s going to be really, really difficult to meet the clean energy goals. It’s not that we shouldn't work hard to meet them but we have to understand that in this current state of affairs, the obstacles are going to be much greater. But when you take offshore wind off the table, the challenge becomes even more enormous.

Why is offshore wind necessary to meet the state’s climate targets?

It’s because it is a large resource that would be coming into the grid over a period of time. The significance is in the megawatts, the size and scale. It was particularly important and we’re land constrained in New England. And all of the sudden you’re taking such a large opportunity in generation off the table.

We can do energy efficiency and we can do solar but as you know from the Shutesbury situation, land is at a premium. Location – you can’t site onshore wind here. We tried really hard under former Governor Deval Patrick and that hit a lot of obstacles. So offshore wind is critical to meeting those goals.

Help me understand the conflicts over this land constraint – is Shutesbury an aberration or a bit of a tale of the tape of the problems here?

The Shutesbury situation reflects how we’re not a large geographical area. We’re not Texas. We can put solar on roofs but you need larger solar installations. We’ve encouraged the solar industry as much as possible. But the area is limited. Wind off the coast provided an alternative that was realistic and not a science experiment.

How much of this problem is state permitting? It feels like there is some land in a space like Massachusetts but people don’t want to use it for this.

Any time you try to put energy infrastructure into New England – whether it's a gas pipeline or a solar installation – there’s a lot of local environmental and permitting regulations that can really hold up a project. One of the good things Massachusetts has done is we made energy permitting easier and went through a permitting reform. We have an Energy Facility Siting Council.

There’s still ways local interests can hold up projects. I think that’s just a fact of life in New England.

So that’s why offshore wind is so important to New England.

It becomes more challenging. From a resource perspective, we are at the end of the fossil fuel pipeline. The middle Atlantic has more gas pipelines coming into it than we do in New England. Offshore wind represented a great opportunity for us.

With respect to the state permitting, it is possible to now overcome some local regulations in state permitting in ways that weren’t possible before. We did address permitting reform in Massachusetts. The Energy Facility Siting Council has played a great, important role in having that happen and [towns] can be overruled to a certain extent.

Well, but it sounds like what you’re saying is that the conflicts will still exist because land is at a premium?

Yeah. And local control will always play a role in that.

The Commonwealth signed permitting reform into law in 2024 and in that there were comprehensive reforms to the process for clean energy infrastructure. This has improved siting. But again that doesn’t always ensure a project will be permitted and you can easily find ways to hold them up.

What gives you hope for the future? Where’s the light at the end of the tunnel for you?

I think that by facilitating permitting reform and also participation – local participation – as early as possible in the stages of projects… I think this is where the key lies. You can pass regulations but a lot of it has to do with doing the work ahead of time on your project and satisfying the local community so you don’t have a bigger fight on your hands.

“Gillespie County is subject to extreme drought, wildfires, and flash flooding events,” Roy wrote. “Naturally, residents are concerned about the environmental risks a battery storage facility poses to one of [the] most vulnerable areas in Texas, among other things.”

Peregrine told me in an email that the company then sought to assuage the congressman’s concerns, speaking with his staff over the phone. But Roy remained unmoved, now fully backing the local opposition to the project. “My office has met with representatives from Peregrine Energy, and while we appreciate the dialogue, we believe that this project warrants scrutiny,” Roy said in a statement provided by his staff when reached for comment. “We look forward to remaining engaged with Peregrine Energy and continuing to represent the people of Harper who feel strongly that this battery facility poses more harm than good.”

Republican interventions like these may feel out of the ordinary to many in the energy sector. Historically, conservative politicians like Roy often vote against writing new regulations governing the environment and public safety, and Texas has often been a bastion for that kind of policymaking. Not to mention Texas is a major hub for battery storage development, second only to California in total capacity installed onto the grid. The Lone Star state’s strained grid means there is no shortage of demand for excess back-up power.

Unfortunately for battery storage developers, national Republicans are now increasingly open to attacking individual battery storage projects in the same way they’ve sometimes fought solar and wind farms, especially when activists on the ground feel they’ve lost the fight with municipal and state regulators.

Last year, we launched The Fight with a story about the unincorporated town of Acton, California, where a battery project was approved by county officials in an area with high risk of experiencing wildfire. Local opponents of the facility, feeling that county and state courts would not fairly adjudicate their concerns, lobbied their elected representative in Congress – then-Rep. Mike Garcia – to do something, anything in response to the situation. And while Garcia was stymied from halting that individual battery project, he then tried to block the Energy Department from streamlining federal permits for the entire battery storage system sector. (The rulemaking was completed before the start of the Trump 2.0 administration. Garcia lost re-election last year.)

At the time, this was the first full-fledged example I could find of a Republican in Congress really picking up the mantle of the “BESS bomb” panic around large-scale battery facilities potentially posing an unacceptable risk to surrounding host communities. Sure, there’d been scares around lithium-ion batteries in e-bikes, for example. But battery storage in general? The sector has enjoyed bipartisan support at the national level, and definitely still does to some extent given that GOP lawmakers declined to pare back the industry’s Inflation Reduction Act credits in their recently-passed tax megabill.

But now there’s a very clear battery fire “butterfly effect” occurring in which local rage fails to get the attention of government officials focused on energy capacity so activists will just go to whatever ears are most sympathetic to them. This is resulting in percolating Republican ire against battery storage, point blank.

Indeed, Heatmap Pro’s August poll of 3,741 registered voters found that there are now three times as many strong opponents of battery storage facilities among Republicans than strong supporters.

Less than a month after Roy’s letter to Peregrine, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin personally visited his native Long Island, New York, to voice his support for those campaigning against a Key Capture Energy battery project in Hauppauge, a hamlet within the town of Islip. The EPA has no role in whether the project is built or not. But the endorsement – coupled with a New York Post op-ed declaring “battery sites are too risky for New York” – came right before a 12-month battery moratorium Islip had enacted was set to expire.

This week Islip extended the moratorium, indefinitely stopping the battery project. Next week, the New York City Council’s committee on fire and emergency management will be holding a public hearing to specifically address the local fears about storage projects.

As for Roy and Peregrine Energy, it’s unclear how the Texas Republican could stop the facility on his own. It has the permits necessary to build and Texas doesn’t have the kind of stringent environmental regulation that creates opportunities to stall construction.

But the lawmaker’s existing political clout in Washington and motivation to win the Republican primary nomination in a heated statewide contest make him a dangerous enemy for any company to have, especially energy developers linked in some way to the transition. As Garcia showed a year ago and Zeldin demonstrated over the summer, someone with a national platform and a megaphone could do a lot of damage to a single project, or worse. We’ve yet to truly see what will come from the flapping of this butterfly’s wings.

But tucked in its press release was an admission from the company’s vice president of development Derek Moretz: this was also about the town, which had enacted a bylaw significantly restricting solar development that the company was until recently fighting vigorously in court.

“There are very few areas in the Commonwealth that are feasible to reach its clean energy goals,” Moretz stated. “We respect the Town’s conservation go als, but it is clear that systemic reforms are needed for Massachusetts to source its own energy.”

This stems from a story that probably sounds familiar: after proposing the projects, PureSky began reckoning with a burgeoning opposition campaign centered around nature conservation. Led by a fresh opposition group, Smart Solar Shutesbury, activists successfully pushed the town to drastically curtail development in 2023, pointing to the amount of forest acreage that would potentially be cleared in order to construct the projects. The town had previously not permitted facilities larger than 15 acres, but the fresh change went further, essentially banning battery storage and solar projects in most areas.

When this first happened, the state Attorney General’s office actually had PureSky’s back, challenging the legality of the bylaw that would block construction. And PureSky filed a lawsuit that was, until recently, ongoing with no signs of stopping. But last week, shortly after the Treasury Department unveiled its rules for implementing Trump’s new tax and spending law, which basically repealed the Inflation Reduction Act, PureSky settled with the town and dropped the lawsuit – and the projects went away along with the court fight.

What does this tell us? Well, things out in the country must be getting quite bleak for solar developers in areas with strident and locked-in opposition that could be costly to fight. Where before project developers might have been able to stomach the struggle, money talks – and the dollars are starting to tell executives to lay down their arms.

The picture gets worse on the macro level: On Monday, the Solar Energy Industries Association released a report declaring that federal policy changes brought about by phasing out federal tax incentives would put the U.S. at risk of losing upwards of 55 gigawatts of solar project development by 2030, representing a loss of more than 20 percent of the project pipeline.

But the trade group said most of that total – 44 gigawatts – was linked specifically to the Trump administration’s decision to halt federal permitting for renewable energy facilities, a decision that may impact generation out west but has little-to-know bearing on most large solar projects because those are almost always on private land.

Heatmap Pro can tell us how much is at stake here. To give you a sense of perspective, across the U.S., over 81 gigawatts worth of renewable energy projects are being contested right now, with non-Western states – the Northeast, South and Midwest – making up almost 60% of that potential capacity.

If historical trends hold, you’d expect a staggering 49% of those projects to be canceled. That would be on top of the totals SEIA suggests could be at risk from new Trump permitting policies.

I suspect the rate of cancellations in the face of project opposition will increase. And if this policy landscape is helping activists kill projects in blue states in desperate need of power, like Massachusetts, then the future may be more difficult to swallow than we can imagine at the moment.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTYxMzU2MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTMwNDgyMH0.1TaDpGAwTbQaE0_tjCCI4IMoemLdU5tb1pGDgKMHcvU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C143%2C0%2C143,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:55.903637

“Without the air nuisance rule available to citizens, polluters will be free to deluge fence line communities with air pollution.

The Ohio EPA says that state regulations similar to the air nuisance rule will remain.","The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency is inching closer to removing a 50-year-old rule that Ohioans have used to combat air pollution.

The proposal is currently open to comments from residents. At a meeting Monday, some took the opportunity to push back on the change.

It’s often referred to as the air nuisance rule, and it can be found in Ohio’s state implementation plan (SIP) of the Clean Air Act. Local governments and Ohio residents have used it to enforce the federal law for decades.

The rule defines air pollution as a public nuisance and allows Ohioans to file federal lawsuits against companies whose emissions they claim jeopardize air quality.

Ohio’s budget bill, which passed earlier this year, directed the Ohio EPA to try to remove this rule from the plan.

“Over time it has become clear that the ANR [Air Nuisance Rule] has not been used and is not needed for attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS),” the Ohio EPA wrote in its draft demonstration. “Over the years, many states have removed their respective ANR as part of the SIP.”

Removal of the rule has received backing from some U.S. legislators and industry stakeholders. The U.S. EPA has already removed the rule once before, but it was reinstated earlier this year.

Two Southwest Ohio residents spoke at Monday’s hearing.

Cincinnati-area resident Marilyn Wall said she’s helped local Ohio communities use the rule to enforce air quality standards where the Ohio EPA wouldn’t.

“Without the air nuisance rule available to citizens, polluters will be free to deluge fence line communities with air pollution. It's time for Ohio officials to hear the voices of Ohio communities and not just the polluters,” Wall said.

Wall and Middletown resident Donna Ballinger filed an appeal in 2022 after the rule was removed from the SIP back in 2020. The pair claimed that its removal “deprived [them] of the ability to pursue relief from this continuing pollution.”

Ballinger lives near a steel mill and industrial coke oven, which can be sources of air emissions. She described the impact of the 2020 removal at the hearing.

“We sent a letter saying we are going to file a citizen suit for the violations of the air nuisance rule,” Ballinger explained. “The state blocked my lawsuit by entering into a consent decree with the Middletown [steelworks], but the pollution never did stop.”

She hopes to once again attempt to use the air nuisance rule to give her relief.

“Ohio EPA has not stopped the pollution even though I call them nearly every day,” she said. “I need to have the air nuisance rule available so I can use it to protect me, my family and my community.”

The Ohio EPA is seeking comments on its proposed plan to remove the air nuisance rule. The deadline for submission is Sept. 22. Once the comments are considered, the Ohio EPA will then submit the requested revision to the U.S. EPA.

The Ohio EPA says that state regulations similar to the air nuisance rule will remain. But they will not allow for citizens to file federal lawsuits for enforcement:

“Although state law does not allow third-party lawsuits like the federal Clean Air Act, under Ohio Law citizens can file a Verified Complaint if they believe there are violations of Ohio EPA rules,” Ohio EPA spokesperson Bryant Somerville wrote in an email.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5437ab8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+91/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F04%2F0df0d3bb4bedb95aabd64928b6b5%2Fpollution-4846741-1280pixabay.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 19:02:07.495456

This positions Australian industry to compete in a global net zero economy.
Rewiring the Nation provides low‑cost finance to expand, modernise and connect renewables to Australia’s electricity grid – particularly transmission lines and renewable energy zones.
This enhanced grid infrastructure allows large‑scale renewable energy generation to reach industrial centres, supporting the shift towards renewable electricity.
This collaboration is exemplified through the National Energy Transformation Partnership, the Capacity Investment Scheme and Renewable Energy Transformation Agreements.","The Australian Government has set an ambitious and achievable emissions reduction target for Australia 62–70% below 2005 levels in 2035. A strong foundation of Commonwealth policies and initiatives encouraging decarbonisation across the economy will underpin emissions reduction in the industry and waste sectors. These initiatives provide the direction, funding and market mechanisms that support the transition to low‑emissions technologies and practices.

Complementing this, state and territory governments play a critical role in reducing emissions through regionally‑tailored regulatory settings, planning systems and infrastructure development. Together, all governments can coordinate to support meaningful progress towards reducing industrial emissions while ensuring the continued growth and resilience of our industrial base.

The industry and waste sector can meaningfully contribute to Australia’s 2035 target and in many instances can act now. For industrial facilities that use low heat processes, immediate decarbonisation opportunities include using commercial technologies such as heat pumps and electric boilers where there is access to electricity, as well as improving energy performance. Others will need to use new technologies or alternative feedstocks and supply chains.

The Safeguard Mechanism gives industry the clearest and most direct signal to reduce emissions in line with Australia's climate targets. It applies a declining emissions baseline to facilities emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2‑e a year and covers approximately 56% of industrial sector scope 1 emissions. The Safeguard Mechanism supports long‑term investment certainty and operational planning as well as encourages investment in commercially viable abatement technologies and alternative inputs. See the Net Zero Plan for more information on the Safeguard Mechanism.

The Safeguard Mechanism will continue to be the main framework for industry facilities to adopt decarbonisation technologies, particularly for heavy industrial facilities. The 2023–24 Safeguard Data Insights from the Clean Energy Regulator shows that Safeguard facilities are already reducing their emissions, abating 2.7 Mt CO2‑e in the first year of operations of the reformed scheme (CER, 2025a). The Safeguard Mechanism can incentivise the uptake of technologies in the near to medium term. These include electric boilers for alumina refining, alternative fuels for cement production, tertiary abatement catalysts for chemicals and improvements to blast furnaces for ironmaking.

The Australian Government is creating a positive investment environment through A Future Made in Australia. This environment lets industry, government and investors share the risks and rewards of investing in clean, low‑emissions industries such as green metals production and battery manufacturing. To support the net zero transformation of existing industries and the growth of new industries, the Australian Government has announced over $22.7 billion to promote industrial development where Australia has comparative advantages. This positions Australian industry to compete in a global net zero economy.

A Future Made in Australia is underpinned by a robust National Interest Framework which will ensure significant public investments incentivise private investment at scale. Government support is in 2 streams:

The Net Zero Transformation Stream for industries that will make a significant contribution to the net zero transition and are expected to have an enduring comparative advantage.

The Economic Resilience and Security Stream for industries that are necessary for domestic economic resilience and require the encouragement of public funding.

To unlock this opportunity, the Australian Government has introduced several funding initiatives:

Green Iron Investment Fund: A $1 billion fund to support early movers in establishing commercial‑scale green iron facilities that use lower emissions technologies such as direct reduction using gas or hydrogen. Up to $500 million of this fund will be used the help support the Whyalla transformation.

Green Aluminium Production Credit: A $2 billion initiative to support aluminium smelters to transition further to renewable electricity, helping position Australian aluminium as some of the greenest in the world.

Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund (external link): A $1.5 billion fund that includes $750 million to support the new technologies needed for green metals through pilot and demonstration projects, and early‑stage development.

Battery Breakthrough Initiative: A $500 million fund to strengthen economic resilience and critical battery manufacturing capabilities, particularly those for high‑value battery products in Australia’s areas of competitive advantage.

Green Metals Innovation Network (external link): A $10 million network run by the CSIRO in collaboration with the Heavy Industry Low‑carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre, which brings together research, government and industry to address key technical and economic challenges for green metals.

The Australian Government is also funding co‑contributions to capital investment and providing attractive financing options through initiatives to support decarbonisation and low‑emissions technologies. The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund (NRF) finances investments in priority areas like renewables and low emissions technologies to support early‑stage startups, growth‑stage companies and mature businesses. The Net Zero Fund will be a new $5 billion sub-fund of the NRF to support major investments by large industrial facilities in decarbonisation and energy efficiency, and scale up manufacturing low emissions technologies. The Net Zero Fund will buttress and modernise domestic industrial capability. The funds will be drawn from existing NRF capital and will be a refocusing of the NRF’s priorities. The Powering the Regions Fund will continue to support a range of decarbonisation investments in Australian industry through:

the $600 million Safeguard Transformation Stream (STS)

the $400 million Industrial Transformation Stream (ITS)

the $400 million Critical Inputs to Clean Energy Industries (CICEI) programs.

The STS and ITS will open new rounds soon. The Australian Government will continue to consider the needs, resourcing and priorities of the fund over time in light of program priorities, the Net Zero Plan and this sector plan.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s Rewiring the Nation program further supports industrial decarbonisation through electrification and renewables. Rewiring the Nation provides low‑cost finance to expand, modernise and connect renewables to Australia’s electricity grid – particularly transmission lines and renewable energy zones. This enhanced grid infrastructure allows large‑scale renewable energy generation to reach industrial centres, supporting the shift towards renewable electricity. The Capacity Investment Scheme provides a long‑term revenue‑underwriting framework that lowers investor risk for new renewable generation and firming resources (like battery storage). The National Electricity Market wholesale market settings review will further help to deliver reliable, competitively priced and secure electricity services. Together, these initiatives allow industries to electrify processes, reduce exposure to volatile fuel markets and adopt renewables at scale – making meaningful, practical industrial decarbonisation achievable. Some important technologies that these measures can enable include deployment of heat pumps and electric boilers.

The Future Gas Strategy and National Hydrogen Strategy are vital pillars to Australia’s industrial decarbonisation by supporting the scale up and adoption of alternative fuels and inputs. The Future Gas Strategy outlines how gas can support the transition towards renewable energy, especially where electrification is not yet viable. Consistent with Future Gas Strategy, the Gas Market Review will examine existing government policies and ensure sufficient gas supply in the longer term. Switching from coal to gas is also an important transition step for industries to reduce their emissions before alternative lower emission inputs and technologies become available.

Renewable hydrogen is critical to industrial decarbonisation for key subsectors. The National Hydrogen Strategy will guide Australia’s production, use and export of hydrogen. The Australian Government’s Hydrogen Headstart program and Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive helps catalyse renewable hydrogen and clean energy industries. These strategies and supporting measures are particularly important for industries that require renewable hydrogen such as green iron and green ammonia production.

Green industries that are supported by the Future Made in Australia investments help deliver a stronger Australian economy. As the global economy decarbonises, existing Australian fossil fuel exports will decline. Clean industries could offset the loss of fossil fuel export revenue. In Treasury’s Renewable Exports Upside Scenario, export revenue from green commodity sectors is projected to reach $178 billion in 2050, provided there is effective coordination, strong ambition and steady technological progress.

Australian governments are increasingly aligning their efforts to coordinate industrial decarbonisation, recognising the need to reduce emissions from hard to abate sectors while maintaining economic competitiveness. All governments are working together to develop and deploy low‑emissions technologies, including renewable hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and electrification of industrial processes. This coordination is critical to ensuring regulatory consistency, supporting shared infrastructure investments and planning the industry transition across jurisdictions.

Australian states and territories are actively developing and implementing strategies, legislation and roadmaps to reduce emissions and support the industrial transition. The state and territory governments are working in close alignment with Australia’s ambitious and achievable target of net zero by 2050. All governments are collaboratively advancing Australia’s industrial decarbonisation through the National Transformation Principles. These underscore a shared commitment to a fair and inclusive transition, emphasising place‑based approaches, First Nations partnerships and regional economic diversification. This collaboration is exemplified through the National Energy Transformation Partnership, the Capacity Investment Scheme and Renewable Energy Transformation Agreements.

Immediate decarbonisation opportunities are available for industrial facilities that use low heat processes. These facilities can use commercially available technologies such as heat pumps and electric boilers and optimise their energy efficiency. Industrial sub‑sectors that use high heat will be on a slower decarbonisation trajectory. They will need new technologies or alternative feedstocks and supply chains to support their transition (Climate Change Authority, 2024). The 4 key areas of decarbonisation focus are:

1. Optimise energy use now to reduce costs

Energy performance upgrades to optimise energy use across the economy could achieve more than 13% of the emissions reductions needed to achieve net zero by 2050 (ANZ; EEC, 2024). It is particularly important for the industrial sectors (DCCEEW, 2024a) and is the first logical step in the decarbonisation pathway for all business in the 9 sub‑sectors. Energy performance upgrades will deliver immediate benefits, are deployable now, and will help reduce the cost of future upgrades (IEA, 2025a).

Energy performance is also a pathway to modernise Australian businesses, improving competitiveness and productivity while reducing emissions (even in hard‑to‑abate sectors). Energy efficiency upgrades that use less energy to do the same job, is an ideal first step in the decarbonisation of industrial processes and can achieve immediate reductions in emissions and energy costs. For example:

The use of heat recovery or thermal energy storage to reduce the amount of gas needed for process heat and to reduce emissions. Thermal energy storage systems can also help businesses better harness renewables and solar to further reduce operational costs (CSIRO, 2023).

Upgrading old equipment such as pumps, refrigeration and hot water systems to improve efficiency. In addition to being more efficient, upgraded equipment typically operates more quickly, with more capacity for optimisation through the incorporation of digitisation and AI technologies. For example, a new air compressor helped a paint maker reduce electricity use by 23% (ANZ; EEC, 2024).

Deploying smart technologies to help monitor and optimise manufacturing processes and energy use.

Many of these energy efficiency measures can be deployed now using commercial technologies that do not require costly whole of plant upgrades. Studies have shown that energy efficiency can deliver an average 11% per annum in energy savings, with some having a payback period of under one year (IEA, 2025b). The $56.7 million Energy Efficiency Grants for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises program supports businesses to upgrade or replace inefficient equipment and implement other energy efficiency activities. The program assists businesses lower their energy use and improve their energy efficiency.

Industries can also optimise energy through demand flexibility to better harness times of peak renewable generation where cost of electricity is low. Demand flexibility is discussed in further detail in the ‘Enabling the Transition’ section below as well as in the Electricity and Energy Sector Plan, but in summary, demand flexibility for industry includes:",https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-08/Default-publication-tile-1.png,N,,2025-09-18 19:01:15.587705

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-09-18 21:20:54+00:00,LAist,"Students, schools race to save clean energy projects in face of Trump deadline - LAist","The Hechinger Report, laist.com, the-hechinger-report",,,,,https://laist.com/news/clean-energy-projects-trump-deadline-schools-education,"Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.
The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news outlet focused on education.

Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In October 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it can find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, co-founder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50% off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat and cool schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phaseout timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as other district-owned electric vehicles. Electric vehicle charging stations must be installed by June 30, 2026, at an eligible location to claim a tax credit. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports, and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects is becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance issued Aug. 15 made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5% of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects is in a position where it’s not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of “zero net energy” by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc64006/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+508/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F11%2F9b%2Ff45f4154487fb97ed7ab45a60697%2Flausd-new-electric-buses-dale.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 18:03:08.103232

The federal government leases federal lands to private companies to extract taxpayer-owned oil and gas, collecting revenue through bids, rents, and royalties. Several pending rules would weaken recent reforms and restore outdated practices:

Bureau of Land Management – Oil and Gas Leasing Rule

Would rescind the 2024 “Fluid Mineral Leases and Leasing Process” rule, which raised outdated fees, rents, and royalties; strengthened bonding requirements; and directed leasing to strategic areas. Congress already rolled back most legislative updates in July, lowering royalty rates from 16.67% back to 12.5% and reopening a loophole for noncompetitive leasing.

Bureau of Land Management – Rescission of the Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Regulations

Would rescind a 2024 final rule that established new standards for development in the Reserve and restricted drilling in designated “Special Areas.”

Forest Service – Oil and Gas Resource Revision

Would modify oil and gas leasing and operations on national forests and grasslands. The rule was originally noticed in 2020 under the first Trump Administration.

Management of Public Lands and Other Taxpayer-Owned Resources

America’s public lands and natural resources are owned by taxpayers and must be managed in a way that balances economic use, environmental stewardship, and long-term sustainability. Several new rules could cost taxpayers by picking winners and losers and undervaluing our taxpayer-owned resources:

Bureau of Land Management – Rescission of Conservation and Landscape Health Rule

Would undo a final rule that designated conservation as a legitimate use under the “multiple use” framework.

Bureau of Land Management – Rescission of the Intermittent Energy Rule

Would repeal a final rule that expediates solar and wind energy project development on public lands, including by decreasing rents and capacity fees, allowing noncompetitive leasing inside Designated Leasing Areas (DLAs), and extending maximum lease terms.

Methane

Oil and gas operations remain among the largest methane emitters in the U.S., wasting billions of cubic feet annually through flaring, venting, and leaks. Several new rules could undercut recent progress to reduce waste and protect taxpayers:

Bureau of Land Management – Royalty for Oil and Gas Lost from Onshore Federal and Indian Leases

Would rescind the March 2024 “Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation,” rule requiring waste minimization plans, leak detection and repair, and royalties on avoidable losses.

Environmental Protection Agency – Extension of Deadlines in Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review

Would delay compliance deadlines for the EPA’s 2024 rule “Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review,” which established emission standards for new facilities and guidelines for state plans to regulate emissions from existing facilities.

Environmental Protection Agency – Additional Reconsideration of Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review

Would “reconsider” the same 2024 standards mentioned above.

Environmental Protection Agency – Reconsideration of Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems (Subpart W)

Would revisit the 2024 rule “Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems,” which increased transparency of emissions from the oil and gas sector, mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) as part of the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP).

Department of Transportation – Pipeline Safety: Repair Criteria for Hazardous Liquid and Gas Transmission Pipelines

Would change when operators must repair hazardous liquid pipelines.

Timber and the Roadless Rule

The U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management manage timber sales on federal lands. Two new rules would repeal the Roadless Rule, leading to money-losing timber sales and costly road construction:

U.S. Forest Service – Special Areas: Roadless Area Conservation Repeal

Would repeal the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) that prohibits road construction, road reconstruction, and timber harvesting in inventoried roadless areas.

U.S. Forest Service – Alaska Roadless Area Management

Would repeal 2023 final rulemaking “Special Areas, Roadless Area Conservation: National Forest System Lands in Alaska” and reinstate the 2020 rule that exempts the Tongass National Forest from the 2001 Roadless Rule.

Bioenergy

Bioenergy—produced from recently living organic materials, or biomass—can be used to generate fuel, electricity, heat, and other products. Proposed rules could increase federal subsidies for biofuels, further distorting markets, raising food and fuel prices, increasing emissions, and undercutting other federal priorities:

Environmental Protection Agency – Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program: Set 2

Would set 2026 blending volumes for cellulosic biofuel, biomass based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

Department of Agriculture – Unleashing American Energy and Economic Prosperity under Title 7 Code of Federal Regulations Part 4280 Subpart B

The proposal will simplify and streamline requirements and processes in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), a program established by the 2008 farm bill to provide loans and grants to agricultural producers and small businesses to install renewable energy systems and improve energy efficiency.

Carbon Capture and Storage

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) refers to a suite of technologies designed to capture carbon emissions from power plants, industrial processes, or directly from the air. The captured carbon is either stored underground or utilized—often to extract more oil and gas. Proposed rules will create new guidelines for CCS activities and risk increasing federal subsidies:

Department of the Interior – Carbon Sequestration

Would establish regulations for transporting and storing captured carbon on the Outer Continental Shelf.

Environmental Protection Agency – Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program

Would end reporting requirements for nearly all major emitters, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

Energy Tax Credits

The federal tax code includes billions of dollars in annual subsidies for the energy sector, delivered through tax credits and preferential treatments that allow companies to significantly lower their effective tax rates. Proposed rules would govern implementation of changes made to energy tax credits in the FY2025 reconciliation bill:

Internal Revenue Service – Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit

Would implement a per-gallon tax credit for low-GHG transportation fuels. First created by the IRA, the 45Z tax credit was modified and extended in the FY2025 reconciliation bill.

Internal Revenue Service – Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

Would govern implementation of the 45U tax credit, which provides up to $15 per MWh for electricity produced by qualifying nuclear facilities. Created by the IRA and later modified to sunset early in the FY2025 reconciliation bill.

I spent 10 weeks interning at Counterpart International, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides lifesaving humanitarian relief to communities around the world and works to empower them to build a more resilient future.

At Counterpart, I had the privilege of working with and learning from such amazing, mission-driven people who have devoted their lives to improving the lives of others. My interactions with Counterpart’s CEO and UD alum, Ann Hudock ’90, were especially influential. Ann’s leadership, wisdom, kindness and unwavering belief in fighting for a more just world inspired me and gave me hope for my future.

Before my experience in D.C., I often felt overwhelmed and uncertain about pursuing a career in environmental protection. My doubts were deepened when someone close to me suggested that I pursue something more tangible, where the impact of my work could be easier to see. Promoting climate resilience and working to address climate change started to feel like an overly ambitious, even naive goal.

This summer was especially difficult for the climate community, with the EPA losing funding, national priorities shifting, and experiencing countless rollbacks to environmental regulations. In the face of all of these challenges, I was able to find glimmers of hope.

Seeing firsthand how Counterpart continued to fight for communities despite the unprecedented changes to the sector of international development greatly inspired me. It showed me that there is always a path forward. Despair can be crippling, but hope for a better, more just and sustainable future is the foundation of real change.

Not only did my time at Counterpart help me come to this realization, but so did the opportunity to talk to so many incredible environmental professionals in the D.C. area. Some of these amazing opportunities included meeting with members of the State Department’s Office of Environmental Affairs and a former EPA official. I was also able to join Citizens’ Climate Lobby for a committee hearing and testify on the importance of maintaining climate funding.

Additionally, I learned a lot about international climate policy and climate change from attending a panel on environmental justice at Howard University and a seminar at the Environmental Law Institute.

These experiences opened my eyes to the many ways one can contribute meaningfully to protecting our beautiful planet. Witnessing such persistence and action towards sustainability this summer has made me more excited to continue my journey in environmental advocacy and protection.

While I’m not sure exactly where my career will take me, I have hope and a renewed confidence that this work is exactly what I am called to do. Our Earth deserves people who are willing to fight for it and I hope that more people will continue to realize that they could have an impact, too.",,N,,2025-09-18 21:59:33.556422

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

Article content

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

Article content

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Article content

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren’t capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it’s also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-09-18 21:06:21+00:00,LAist,Schools and clean energy - LAist,Not Available,,,,,https://laist.com/brief/news/clean-energy-projects-trump-deadline-schools-education,"But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects.
The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.
As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news outlet focused on education.

Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In October 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it can find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, co-founder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50% off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat and cool schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phaseout timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as other district-owned electric vehicles. Electric vehicle charging stations must be installed by June 30, 2026, at an eligible location to claim a tax credit. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports, and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects is becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance issued Aug. 15 made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5% of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects is in a position where it’s not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of “zero net energy” by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc64006/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+508/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F11%2F9b%2Ff45f4154487fb97ed7ab45a60697%2Flausd-new-electric-buses-dale.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 18:03:12.087850

OPmobility plans to assemble bumpers in Normal for Rivian’s new lower-cost R2 model that goes into production next year. It's expected to start at $45,000.

OPmobility said Thursday it will hire 81 employees in Normal for logistics, assembly, loading, and other roles. They’ll make at least 20% above the average wage for that job classification across McLean County. The company also said it will make a “significant capital investment” in Normal.

In exchange, OPmobility will get an unspecified amount of tax breaks as part of the state's Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois [REV Illinois] program, aimed at clean energy production and manufacturing. Rivian itself has lined up hundreds of millions of dollars in state incentives through that program in support of the R2 launch.

“We appreciate the State of Illinois's partnership and support in helping attract key suppliers to the Normal area,” Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “Our Normal supplier park will provide improved material supply logistics as we increase production in 2026 to build R2, in addition to R1 and our commercial vans.”

Rivian announced the new 1.2 million-square-foot supplier park in May, but no tenants were named at that time. Rivian also is getting millions in state and local tax incentives for the supplier park located across the street from the main manufacturing plant.

“In Illinois, we aren’t just making electric vehicles: we are creating an entire ecosystem — attracting investments, bolstering our workforce, and strengthening the EV manufacturing supply chain,” said Gov. JB Pritzker. “Rivian’s investment will attract suppliers from across the globe to invest in Illinois and continue to create good-paying jobs, providing Illinois with the competitive edge to thrive in the clean energy economy.”

OPmobility is a global company, with 26 plants and nine research-and-development centers in North America.

“This step reflects OPmobility’s commitment to scaling innovation and delivering value across key markets. The U.S. is a key pillar of our strategy, and we’re excited to deepen our presence in a market that continues to shape the future of mobility with this facility in Illinois,” said Thibaut Stern, president for North America of OPmobility Exterior & Lighting.

A bipartisan House group released a permitting reform “framework” on Thursday that aims to make it easier to build transmission lines, pipelines and other power projects in the face of rising energy demand.

The 47-member Problem Solvers Caucus intends to turn the framework into legislation. The framework calls for streamlining the permitting process, partly by setting deadlines for court reviews of permitting decisions.

“The number one issue Americans are concerned about is the cost of living,” Rep.Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y. and Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair, said in a press release. “Sky-high energy costs play an enormous role — electricity prices rose more than 6.5% in just the last year, and demand is skyrocketing.”

However, it can take years and in some cases decades for green energy and other projects to get built and connected to the grid, according to Suozzi.

The framework calls for:

Reducing the statute of limitations for permitting lawsuits to one year or less, with 150-day limits for FAST-41 projects;

Restricting judicial standing for litigating projects to parties who submitted detailed comments during public review;

Clarifying that Clean Water Act Section 401 certifications by states should focus only on water quality impacts of a project that result from the federally permitted or licensed activity;

Requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to initiate interregional transmission planning while prohibiting allocating costs to customers who receive no or trivial benefits from the projects;

Amending the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors process to allow for individual national interest high-impact transmission lines;

Promoting grid-enhancing technologies to maximize capacity on existing transmission lines; and,

Expediting geothermal project permitting by allowing for simultaneous consideration of multiple project phases, while requiring agencies to approve or deny applications within 30 days after completing all legal and regulatory reviews.

The framework comes amid calls for addressing permitting reform in Congress this year.

“Rapid deployment of new energy infrastructure — including generation, transmission, and pipelines — is the lynchpin to providing more energy to our customers, meeting growing energy demand, and winning the AI race,” Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, said in a letter to House and Senate leaders on Tuesday.

Maloney said Congress needed to “act now” to streamline permitting processes and make sure that the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act aren’t used to delay infrastructure projects.

EEI, a trade group for investor-owned utilities, and other utility groups support the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, which would make various changes to NEPA requirements and was discussed during a House hearing on Sept. 10.

During the hearing, Democrats said actions by the Trump administration — rescinding funding, reducing the federal workforce and hampering solar and wind development — undermined the prospect of compromise on permitting reform, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

If the SPEED Act passed the House in its current form, it would likely face “an uphill climb” in the Senate where a stand-alone bill could face a filibuster, the research firm said in a Sept. 11 client note. However, it could be attached to “must-pass” spending bills, ClearView analysts noted.

In a blog post calling for permitting reforms, Martin Durbin, U.S. Chamber of Commerce senior vice president for policy, decried the Trump administration’s recent stop-work orders for offshore wind projects.

An earlier report from Wood Mackenzie forecast that residential solar installations will slow in the coming years in the wake of Trump’s ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’, which was passed in July, and the passage of the Net Energy Metering (NEM 3.0) bill in industry leader California has hampered the business case for installing residential solar projects in the state.

Indeed, California is one of the “leading states” for VPP penetration, according to the Wood Mackenzie report. Along with Texas, New York and Massachusetts, these states account for 37% of VPP deployments, while the PJM and ERCOT grids have the largest utility commitments to data centre capacity, and the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

The report also notes that over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30%, compared to 2024 figures, with 192 unique offtakers and 433 programmes monetised in 2025, representing increases of 38% and 35% compared to the previous year.

Looking ahead, the Wood Mackenzie report identifies “regulatory pushback” as a key obstacle to further VPP integration, pointing to utilities’ practice of rate basing distributed energy resources – including the cost of distributed energy systems in the utilities’ asset base, from which they can earn a return – as one that limits opportunities for new distributed energy investment.

The Trump administration has moved to block several offshore wind projects that were approved and got permits to build during the Biden administration.
Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of moderate members of both parties, on Thursday proposed a new framework for a potential bipartisan deal.
Even prior to the moves to block offshore wind, Democrats were raising concerns about the Trump administration’s assault on renewables.
Still, other Democrats are seeking a bipartisan agreement, even with the Trump administration’s anti-renewable policies.","The Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy are making it more difficult for lawmakers to reach a bipartisan energy deal.

Key Democrats say they are not willing to play ball to achieve a deal on permitting reform unless the administration stops going after green energy projects — especially those that have already been approved.

“The elephant in the room now is the stop-work orders that the administration has put out because if you can ignore the law and you can stop someone’s job on a fully permitted project, then does permitting law really matter?” Sen. Martin Heinrich (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked The Hill in a recent interview.

The Trump administration has moved to block several offshore wind projects that were approved and got permits to build during the Biden administration.

The Trump administration has said in a series of court filings that it hopes to block at least three of those projects, including one in New England that was already about 80 percent constructed.

The White House has carried out multiple attacks on green energy. It has previously slashed tax subsidies for renewables, sought to slow down federal approval of wind and solar projects and said it would try to block projects that take up a lot of room, which would disproportionately impact the sector.

At the same time, the administration has expressed support for cutting red tape, which lawmakers say they hope to do with a bipartisan deal.

Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of moderate members of both parties, on Thursday proposed a new framework for a potential bipartisan deal.

Their framework includes provisions supported by Republicans to limit lawsuits over energy projects while also giving Democrats wins they’re seeking to build out more power lines — which they hope could get renewable energy onto the grid more quickly.

At the same time, the framework’s backers said the Trump administration will have to stop targeting renewables in order for a deal to actually be achieved.

“If we keep on going in this process and we get near the finish line, and the argument becomes, ‘Hey, you guys are making this deal, and they’re not going to approve any of the green projects anyway,’ then it’s going to be very hard for us to keep the deal going forward,” said Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.).

“We need to see good faith, not only from our colleagues, which we’ve been seeing in our Problem Solvers Group, we need to see good faith in the White House also,” Suozzi added.

Spokespeople for the White House, as well as the Interior Department, which has made several of the anti-renewable moves, did not respond to The Hill’s requests for comment.

Even prior to the moves to block offshore wind, Democrats were raising concerns about the Trump administration’s assault on renewables.

“We are stuck in a pickle of not being able to trust the Trump administration to execute fairly, faithfully in the words of the Constitution, whatever law we would pass,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told The Hill in July.

Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said lawmakers will have to “get the assurances that we’re going to need from the Trump administration that whatever we agree to is actually going to be implemented by them and they’re not just going to cherry-pick” to only benefit “fossil fuel and Republicans” rather than “clean energy or Democrats.”

“They’ve got to come to us and make a case that is convincing,” he said.

During an Environmental Protection Agency-led roundtable on Monday, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) told players in the tech sector that “the way to get certainty on all accounts is to have regulatory reform through Congress.”

Asked by The Hill this week whether the Trump administration’s actions are making it harder to reach a deal, Capito said, “Time will tell.”

Many in the business community, especially the energy industry, have been pushing Congress to reach an accord.

“Our message to lawmakers right now is that this stands to benefit every sector of the American economy,” said Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, a major oil and gas lobbying group.

On oil and gas specifically, he said that a faster process “will help bring more supply into the marketplace … and that plays a critical role in putting downward pressure on prices.”

Lawmakers have sought to put together an agreement to speed up approvals for energy and other infrastructure projects for a long time, with Republicans hoping to bolster fossil fuels while many Democrats have sought to bolster renewable energy.

Nevertheless, it’s an issue that has divided Democrats, as progressives have argued that faster projects could mean less environmental scrutiny and more pollution.

Still, other Democrats are seeking a bipartisan agreement, even with the Trump administration’s anti-renewable policies.

Heinrich told The Hill he hopes to ultimately get an arrangement across the finish line.

“If we can get some clarity and confidence that the administration is going to respect the law with respect to permitting, then I do think we can negotiate a path forward,” he said.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/09/heinrichmartin_032525gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 20:03:59.245701

BALTIMORE, Sept. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- CPower Energy (""CPower""), a leading Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform, today announced that it has been named a VPP market leader by Wood Mackenzie for the third year running. As with past reports, the Wood Mackenzie 2025 North America virtual power plant report ranked CPower for its dispatchable load under management and number of market and utility demand response programs, among other criteria.

The report is published as grid operators and utilities nationwide struggle with unprecedented demand growth from artificial intelligence computing, data centers and the electrification of transportation, housing and other sectors of the economy.

According to Wood Mackenzie, company deployments, unique offtakers and utility and market programs monetized grew over 33% in North America year-over-year. A frigid winter and relentless summer heat waves have driven up demand peaks this year, underscoring the value of VPPs in enhancing grid reliability and flexibility.

Year-to-date, CPower has dispatched customers across more than 900 events, 40% more this year than last. The resulting relief provided by big-box retailers, data centers, manufacturers, hospitals, schools and other large load customers has helped keep the lights on and the economy going in communities nationwide.

""We are honored that Wood Mackenzie has again validated CPower's leadership in Virtual Power Plants. Fast, reliable demand response has never been more critical because it empowers energy users to be part of the solution,"" said Michael D. Smith, CEO, CPower. ""Without tapping into existing customer-sited assets, the U.S. risks missing out on billions of dollars in market growth from AI alone over the next five years due to a lack of energy.""

Wood Mackenzie's VPP report found that while data centers drive demand growth, CPower counterbalances their impact. With nearly 23,000 sites nationwide, CPower leverages the flexible energy of customers across all major industries, including data centers, hyper scalers and bitcoin miners, making them grid assets.

""CPower's leadership in the VPP space is rooted in its approach to customer performance across every different industry,"" said Ben Hertz-Shargel, Global Head of Grid Edge, Wood Mackenzie. ""There's finally widespread recognition that VPPs can put money back in the pockets of businesses, rather than just raising rates on them through infrastructure development.""

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein.
This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event.
The SRF Helene funds for western North Carolina towns that have experienced Helene damage will continue to be available through year-round applications until 2026.
The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton, and Asheville.","Governor Josh Stein announced today that five western North Carolina counties will receive more than $86 million in funding for 14 drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency program for disaster-affected states. North Carolina is the first state impacted by Helene to award grants from this program.

The awards require that drinking water and wastewater funds be used to improve flood resilience in systems that were impacted by Hurricane Helene, and septic system funds must be used to improve flood resilience to septic systems in Helene-affected areas.

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein. “These grants will help towns across western North Carolina strengthen their water infrastructure so that it can better withstand future storms.”

“These are the first awards from the $686 million from the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water, wastewater, and septic system repairs and upgrades in the wake of Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “Importantly, all funded projects must ensure that the systems will be more resilient to future flooding events. Having clean and reliable water is critical for the health of our people. Everyone expects and deserves to turn on the tap and receive water that is safe to drink.”

Notable projects include:

The Town of Gamewell (Caldwell County) will receive $775,200 in Principal Forgiveness (PF) to replace/relocate gravity sewer lines and incorporate resiliency through various measures, including stream bank stabilization. High water from excessive rainfall during Helene caused erosion of the riverway and damaged pipe and support piers.

The Town of Waynesville (Haywood County) will receive $5 million in PF to convert a gravity sewer line to a force main with a new pump station and to relocate an existing junction box outside of the 500-year flood plain.

Town of Drexel (Burke County) will receive $5 million in PF to fortify lines in the floodplain and to convert a treatment unit into an equalization basin. The pump station was flooded during Helene, and installing an equalization basin would help reduce Sanitary Sewer Overflows and provide resiliency.

The City of Morganton (Burke County) and the Town of Drexel (Burke County) individually submitted separate applications for the Morganton-Valdese-Drexel interconnection project. This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event. Drexel will receive $5.1 million for its share of this project. Morganton will receive $10 million in funding for its share.

Junaluska Sanitary District (Haywood County) will receive $10 million to rebuild and provide resilience to withstand floods. The shifting of the Pigeon River due to Helene flooding adversely impacted its old system. The proposed project will replace outdated, undersized, and aged water mains that service more than 300 residential connections along the Pigeon River. These lines are dead-end lines and are not looped or connected to other water mains. New water mains, along with valves, new water supply wells outside of the 500-year flood plain, and installation of backup power will provide resiliency, specifically for Haywood Community Hospital and Haywood County Emergency Services.

Woodfin Sanitary District (Buncombe County) will receive $5 million to install emergency standby power and replace inoperable control valves at the water treatment plant to ensure operators can properly operate and maintain the system during emergencies.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive $5 million in PF to include flood resiliency improvements to three pump stations and to improve approximately 5,600 linear feet of gravity sewer. Generators and flood protection walls will be added, and wet wells and electrical equipment will be elevated.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive an additional $5.2 million to install a new redundant transmission line beneath the French Broad River from the well system to the distribution system and to install a new redundant waterline under Spring Creek to feed the 200,000-gallon water storage tank; to construct a new 200,000-gallon water tank adjacent to an existing tank to provide redundant system storage; to replace approximately 6,000 linear feet of damaged water lines; to rehabilitate and improve the existing supervisory control and data acquisition system to ensure operability and access during flood events; to install radio read meters, which will allow the town to quickly identify water leaks and provide repairs for customers; and to install back-up standby power to increase resiliency.

A list of all Hurricane Helene projects approved forfunding (Opens in new window) at the State Water InfrastructureAuthority's (Opens in new window) (SWIA’s) Sept. 17meeting (Opens in new window) is available on the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) website. The Authority is an independent body with primary responsibility for awarding federal and state funding for water infrastructure projects.

The Hurricane Helene funding came from the federal Supplemental Appropriations for Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Hawai’i Wildfires (SA-HMW), referred to in North Carolina as State Revolving Fund (SRF) Helene funds.

The Division will continue to accept applications on a rolling basis for the new federal SRF Helene funds from the 2025 American Relief Act to build resilience to water infrastructure for Hurricane Helene-impacted communities. The SRF Helene funds for western North Carolina towns that have experienced Helene damage will continue to be available through year-round applications until 2026.

Applications received by the dates below will be reviewed and presented at a subsequent SWIA meeting as follows:

First round of applications received by August 1 were presented to SWIA and awarded on September 17.

Applications received by November 3 will be presented to SWIA on December 10, 2025.

Applications received by January 9, 2026, will be presented to SWIA on February 18, 2026.

Applications received by March 2, 2026, will be presented to SWIA on April 15-16, 2026.

Drinking Water SRF Helene and Clean Water SRF Helene funding is available to local government units (LGUs) and nonprofit water corporations (and investor-owned drinking water corporations for the DWSRF) in the form of zero-interest loans and principal forgiveness. Applicants must document impacts from Hurricane Helene and the proposed project must include resiliency with the purpose of reducing flood damage risk and vulnerability to rapid hydraulic change or natural disaster.

The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton, and Asheville. These were followed by in-person applicationtrainings (Opens in new window) in July and August, directly related to applying for the SRF Helene funds, in Clyde, Hickory, Boone, and Research Triangle Park/Durham.

The company has secured $40 million in Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credits by selling credits generated from U.S.-made inverters produced in Austin, Texas SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ]. This marks a pivotal moment in the maturation of the tax credit transfer market, demonstrating how manufacturers can monetize domestic production incentives to fund further expansion.

By Q4 2024, SolarEdge aims to produce residential systems with 35.6% domestic content, enabling customers to access bonus tax credits under the IRA's 45L program SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ]. This creates a virtuous cycle: higher domestic content in SolarEdge's systems translates to greater tax credit eligibility for installers, which in turn drives demand for its products. The company has already signed safe harbor agreements with major residential solar installers, including

Global Expansion: Leveraging U.S.-Made, Non-PFE Technology

While SolarEdge's domestic focus is clear, its global ambitions are equally strategic. In Q3 2025, the company began exporting U.S.-manufactured residential solar products to Australia, with plans to expand to additional international markets by year-end SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ]. This move leverages SolarEdge's non-PFE (Prohibited Foreign Entity) status, a critical differentiator in regions wary of geopolitical supply chain risks. CEO Shuki Nir emphasized that exporting American-made products reinforces the company's commitment to quality and innovation, both domestically and abroad SolarEdge Announces First Section 45X Credit Sale[ 1 ].

The global solar market is projected to grow at a 12% CAGR through 2030, and SolarEdge's U.S.-based production positions it to capitalize on this demand without compromising on supply chain security SolarEdge Marks Milestones in U.S. Manufacturing Strategy[ 3 ]. By producing in the U.S., the company avoids the tariffs and trade barriers that often plague imported solar equipment, making its solutions more competitive in international markets.

Investment Implications: A Resilient, Policy-Aligned Play

SolarEdge's expansion of U.S. manufacturing is not just a defensive move—it's a proactive strategy to dominate a rapidly evolving market. The company's ability to monetize IRA tax credits, secure long-term partnerships, and scale production at a rapid pace suggests strong financial discipline and operational agility. With over 2,000 new U.S. jobs created and a production roadmap that includes commercial inverter output by early 2025 SolarEdge Expands U.S. Manufacturing in Salt Lake City, Utah[ 2 ], SolarEdge is building a durable competitive moat.

For investors, SolarEdge represents a compelling intersection of policy tailwinds, supply chain innovation, and global market access.

Sheldon Whitehouse announced a probe on Tuesday into the role that industry groups and other organizations played in the proposed roll back of the federal government’s key “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases.

But in July, the Trump administration announced its intention to revoke that finding.
However, the request is not enforceable and there is no legal requirement for those groups to provide the requested documents.

Sheldon Whitehouse announced a probe on Tuesday into the role that industry groups and other organizations played in the proposed roll back of the federal government’s key “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases.

The endangerment finding, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2009, has served as the basis for the agency’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations for more than a decade. But in July, the Trump administration announced its intention to revoke that finding.

In a statement announcing the proposal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency had heard from “stakeholders” that “EPA’s [greenhouse gas emissions] standards themselves, not carbon dioxide … was the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods.”

Whitehouse, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a longtime climate hawk, pushed against those claims on Tuesday and questioned whether fossil fuel interests had unduly influenced the administration’s decision.

“I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding … played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal,” Whitehouse wrote in his requests for documents.

The senator sent records requests to 24 companies and organizations, including oil and gas trade association the American Petroleum Institute (API), conservative and libertarian organizations like the Heritage Foundation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and automotive manufacturers.

The letters set a deadline of Sept. 30 for those groups to provide internal and external communications with executive branch officials, the Trump campaign, Trump’s presidential transition team and other relevant parties.

However, the request is not enforceable and there is no legal requirement for those groups to provide the requested documents.

Whitehouse wrote that if the repeal of the endangerment finding is approved, “it would hand massive benefits to polluting industry actors and their enablers, allowing them to reap billions in profit while shifting the burdens of climate disasters onto the American families, businesses, and taxpayers.”

Inside Climate News has separately filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the EPA requesting copies of all communications between the agency and representatives, employees or lobbyists for some of the groups listed in Whitehouse’s letter, including the American Petroleum Institute.

A source within the oil and gas industry denied that API was involved in “developing or drafting” the EPA’s proposal to rescind the endangerment finding.

And in an emailed statement, a spokesperson for API said that “although we believe that the federal government has a role to play in regulating greenhouse gases—including methane—the previous administration’s unlawful and unpopular EV mandates were a clear abuse of the federal government’s authority.

“As the administration begins this process, we look forward to working with them in the months ahead to finalize a smart and effective regulatory approach,” the statement said.

Still, fossil fuel interests haven’t shied away from engaging with the Trump administration this year to achieve their priorities.

In July, the EPA published a rule extending deadlines for companies working with oil and natural gas to limit emissions of methane and other harmful pollutants. A separate source within the industry confirmed to Inside Climate News that industry leaders had requested that extension, despite the fact that many parties were already meeting the requirements of that emissions rule.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has also been criticized as a handout to the fossil fuel industry, as it increases lease sales for drilling and mandates that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining, while accelerating the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar development.

Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told CNBC at the time that the bill “includes almost all of our priorities.”

The oil and gas industry also spent about $71 million lobbying the federal government in the first and second quarters of 2025. That puts the industry slightly behind its pace from 2024.

However, watchdog organizations told Inside Climate News that the lack of increased spending on lobbying by the industry amid major policy wins actually underscores its existing influence, and cited the number of industry insiders placed into key government positions and Trump’s already-friendly attitude toward fossil fuels.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2235747236-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 19:01:59.338677

""The Great Nicobar project is being implemented with a sense of responsibility and in full compliance with ecological and tribal policies.","Synopsis

Bhupender Yadav, the Union Environment Minister, has criticized the Congress party. He accused them of opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project. Yadav stated the project is vital for national security. Sonia Gandhi had earlier criticized the project. She cited environmental and tribal concerns. Yadav defended the project. He emphasized its strategic importance and adherence to environmental safeguards.

Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Thursday hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in ""negative politics"".

Speaking at an event organized by The Public Affairs Forum of India here, Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region.

Yadav said only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar's forest area will be used for the project.

""Does the country not even have the right to use this much land for its security, transport capacity and modern technology? Questioning every institution, raising doubts over every developmental effort and writing columns when it comes to national security is nothing but negative politics,"" he said.

The minister maintained that policies for indigenous tribes have been fully respected and implemented.

Live Events

""For the indigenous tribes living there, policies have been made and fully implemented. We are committed to protecting the nation's ecology. Moreover, our premier institutions... ZSI, BSI, WII have prepared management plans, and we have followed them entirely,"" Yadav said.

He added that ecology and economy should progress together.

""Politics should be for building the nation, not for spreading misinformation. Unfortunately, some people are indulging in the politics of spreading confusion,"" he said.

Yadav's remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the Rs 72,000 crore project a ""planned misadventure"" that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world's most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by ""making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes"".

""The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project's proposed land area. The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami. This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,"" Gandhi had said.

She also argued that the Shompen face an even greater threat as the project denotifies a significant part of their reserve and will bring a large influx of people and tourists to the island.

In response, Yadav recently authored a column in the same newspaper, defending the project as one of strategic, defence and national importance.

He said the plan is designed to transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region, with an international container transhipment terminal, a greenfield international airport, a 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant and a township over 16 sq km.

The minister stressed that detailed environmental impact assessments, wildlife conservation plans, disaster management strategies and compensatory afforestation provisions had been put in place to minimise ecological impact.

He also argued that development on less than two per cent of the island's total forest cover cannot be equated with the threats portrayed by the Congress.

""Even today, 90 per cent of the island remains under forest cover. Compensatory afforestation has to be carried out somewhere, and if it has been done (in Haryana), it also contributes to cleaning Delhi's air. Does the country not even have the right to pursue development on less than two per cent of land?"" he said at Thursday's event.

Yadav reiterated that the project is essential for national security, while dismissing Congress criticism as politically motivated.

""The Great Nicobar project is being implemented with a sense of responsibility and in full compliance with ecological and tribal policies. Raising doubts over it amounts to misleading the people. This is not healthy politics,"" he said.

Advocates already emphasise CCS as a key mitigating solution in the transition to a low-carbon future, especially as power producers accommodate continued rising demand while also pursuing emissions reductions.

In February, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast global electricity consumption to rise at its fastest pace in recent years – nearly 4% annually through 2027 – as power-hungry segments like data centres and air-conditioning expand, and developing nations industrialise.1

Why does carbon capture matter?

Leaders in boardrooms in nearly every segment across the energy production spectrum are taking note, including fossil fuel-fed power producers, LNG exporters, hydrogen and derivatives producers, downstream oil and gas firms and gas refineries and petrochemical businesses. In the U.S. electric power sector alone, Energy Information Administration (EIA) figures offer a compelling case for effective, technology-driven mechanisms, such as CCS. In 2023, the sector accounted for 33% of total U.S. primary energy consumption - and about 30% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions. Specifically, in electric power production, natural gas contributed 50% and coal 49%, of CO2 emissions.2

Carbon capture as an industry solution

Measured against the Paris Agreement to limit a global temperature rise to 1.5°C, impactful emissions reduction solutions are critical across the energy ecosystem.

CO2 traps heat close to the ground when released and can remain for hundreds of years. Industrial facilities, including power stations, produce CO2 when burning fossil fuels.

CCS equipment helps to change that paradigm by separating CO2 before it exits the smokestack. From there, it can be compressed and shipped – usually via pipeline – to long-term, deep underground storage locations, such as defunct coal seams.

Whether through retrofitting or engineering into new facility construction, this route to CO2 reduction can offer existing and emerging infrastructure opportunities to contain emissions, while energy producers embrace the likes of lower-carbon LNG and scale to meet future demand with renewables such as hydrogen.

Both industry, prosumers and governments are paying attention – and collaborating as they create more effective pathways toward net-zero.

Findings from 2024’s Global Status of CCS report revealed significant year-on-year CCS momentum worldwide with strong project growth across all stages of development. It said global CO2 capture capacity is on track to double to more than 100 million tons per year (Mtpa) of CO2, once facilities currently under construction commence operation.3

The global CCS landscape

According to the Global CCS Institute’s Global CCS Institute’s Global Status of CCS 2024 report4, there are 50 CCS facilities operating globally with more than 628 facilities in the development pipeline across sectors including chemicals, ethanol, ammonia/fertiliser, natural gas/LNG, oil refining, gas and coal power generation, and heat, waste-to-energy, plus hard-to-abate industries such as cement/concrete, iron and steel.

The efficacy of CCS can go further and can create a pathway to net-negative emissions; for example, when linked with bioenergy - which uses organic matter from plants or animals to produce power - and hydrogen production derived via biomass.

CCS can, in short, be a potent bridging partner as grids are modernised to be more energy efficient and reliable, by enabling the integration of variable renewable energy sources, managing peak demand and decarbonising existing fossil fuel power plants.

Potential implications for businesses that fail to decarbonise

Beyond climate motivation, pressure on power regenerators and other energy businesses to decarbonise can surface at various levels - each with potential implications including cost and reputation.

Emissions regulations can bring stiff penalties for non-compliance, hiking operational costs. Additionally, customers and investors may demand it. As with most technologies, CCS faces critics and challenges.

Broader adoption can promote accessibility and yield implementation savings. Growing investment can drive innovations which squeeze price and encourage scalability, so CCS can fulfil its potential in net-zero energy strategies.

Making carbon capture accessible and scalable

Governments recognise incentives are required to make CCS economically viable for industries. Among them, the U.S.’ 45Q tax credit was recently reaffirmed at $85/ton for point-source capture5, and the UK government’s $21.7 billion funding package over 25 years supports CCS clusters.6 Australia was recently offering grants of up to A$25m for pilot/pre-commercial projects via its Carbon Capture, Use and Storage Development Fund, beside tax breaks.7

As a technology leader in both the CCS and energy space and backed by over a century of innovation solving challenges across the energy production network and numerous other industries, Honeywell brings deep expertise to carbon capture. With advanced technologies across the energy sector, customers can tailor solutions to their specific needs – providing support for Honeywell’s forecasted cumulative impact of mitigating approximately 320 million metric tons of CO₂e between 2023 and 2030.8

NIPSCO wants to create a subsidiary to charge data centers for all the new infrastructure they'll need to operate, insulating its current customers from big rate hikes. But the consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition has concerns.

CAC's Ben Inskeep said NIPSCO hasn't provided a lot of info on how this would work — so there's no guarantee that customers won't end up paying for new power plants in the long run.

""[That the contract] has the terms included in it that are going to require that data center to pay for these generation assets in full. And that there's not some sort of residual risk that could fall — or be borne by other customers should something go wrong,"" he said.

The subsidiary would negotiate with tech companies privately rather than going through Indiana's public ratemaking process.

""The public will have no idea whether or not this is a fair deal overall or maybe the data centers are getting a sweetheart deal that the public is being kept from seeing because of that confidential nature,"" Inskeep said.

Indiana Michigan Power requires tech companies to make long-term financial commitments to pay for new power plants built to serve them. Inskeep said these agreements have been made public.

New York Climate Week is just a few days away and the clean tech news is flying thick and fast. Why, it’s almost as if the rest of the world is still chasing the renewable energy rainbow, despite the U-turn taken by the US. Even the well known hater of wind and solar power, US President Donald Trump, has gotten into the Climate Week spirit — whether he knows it or not, that is. Read on for more on that and other clean tech news in the runup to New York Climate Week 2025.

Lower Interest Rates Are Good For Renewable Energy

Our friends over at Heat Map have the scoop on the relationship between lower interest rates and renewable energy. Their newsletter of September 18 leads off with a quote from reporter Matthew Zeitlin, who reported that Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate cut may “provide some relief to renewables developers and investors, who are especially sensitive to financing costs.”

Zeitlin cited Center for Public Enterprise climate analyst climate Advait Arun, who said that “high rates are never going to be exactly a good thing … it’s going to be good that we’re finally seeing cuts.”

“Since solar and wind rely on basically free fuel, the bulk of developers’ costs to build panels or turbines are upfront. That requires borrowing money, meaning interest rates have an outsize impact on the total cost of renewable projects,” Zeitline added. “Renewables carry more debt than fossil fuel plants. When interest rates rise by 2 percentage points, the levelized cost of electricity for renewables rises by 20%, compared to 11% for a gas fired plant, according to a report last year by the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.”

That won’t be much help to the US offshore wind industry, which is all but dead in the water after Trump suspended the federal offshore lease program upon which the industry depends. Still there is plenty of activity in the solar industry field to go around, and the onshore wind repowering field may see some benefits, too.

Trump has been insisting all year on a rate cut, a rate cut, a rate cut. That’s what he got, and according to the law of unintended consequences that may help his arch enemies, the US wind and solar industries, stay afloat over the next three years or so, until he leaves office as scheduled — peacefully one hopes, this time — on January 20, 2029.

Carrier Carries The Torch For Battery-Enabled HVAC, With Heat Pumps

In other news to hit the CleanTechnica inbox before Climate Week, on September 17 Carrier Global Corporation announced that it is trialing battery-enabled HVAC systems. If all goes according to plan, the new storage-plus-HVAC model will enable ordinary households to sock away renewable energy when excess wind and solar power are available, and deploy it under a strategic scenario to help grid managers stabilize the grid through periods of peak demand.

The experiment comes under the wing of Carrier’s new “Carrier Energy” branch. “Carrier has been shaping the future of climate technology since Willis Carrier invented modern air conditioning in 1902,” explained Carrier Chairman and CEO David Gitlin in a press statement. “Now, we’re installing our first battery-enabled HVAC systems in homes to validate performance. These systems can help strengthen the grid, support renewable integration and maintain comfort — all while adapting to evolving energy demands.”

The renewables-friendly effort hooks Carrier Energy up with EPRI, the independent Electric Power Research Institute, which is still carrying on the important task of modernizing the US grid in synch with the decentralized principles of Distributed Energy Resources, meaning wind and solar power among other scalable resources.

“Through these trials, Carrier is assessing how its next-generation HVAC system — pairing more efficient variable-speed heat pumps with battery storage — can help reduce peak demand by shifting energy use from on-peak to off-peak periods, providing greater grid flexibility and resilience,” the company explains.

To put the impact of the storage-plus-HVAC model on the pace of decarbonizing the US grid into perspective, Carrier suggests that we consider that about 30 million of its HVAC units are spinning their fans in homes across the US and Canada, cumulatively accounting for a 100-gigawatt potential for flexible demand. “At scale, these systems could offer utilities a powerful tool to manage electricity demand,” Carrier emphasizes.

So Much Winning For Renewable Energy, For Now

To be clear, Trump, his Cabinet, and his Republican allies in Congress are not hating on all forms of renewable energy. They just hate wind and solar. Hydropower, geothermal, biomass, and even the new field of marine energy are all in the clear, covered by the protective embrace of Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” plan, along with nuclear energy.

As for why wind and solar failed to make the American Energy Dominance cut, perhaps the US solar industry just had the misfortune to get caught in the crossfire when Trump aimed the full force of his perch in the White House to promote his personal vendetta against wind turbines.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, consider that “reliability” is the key word in Trump’s otherwise whackadoodle American Energy Dominance plan. As for what “reliability” actually means, your guess is as good as mine, but it probably refers back to an anachronistic, 20th century standard referring to the 24/7 availability of power generation regardless of the weather. Applied to the 21st century, though, the reliability standard conveniently skips over the modern world of energy storage, smart grid technologies, and virtual power plants. However, it does lend a thin veneer of respectability to an otherwise cockamamie energy policy that can only be ascribed to the whims of a dictator. After all, wind and solar — especially solar — are easily the most abundant, accessible and affordable domestic energy resources available today.

Come to think of it, though, since when has Trump needed to veneer anything? After all, this is the man who famously said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, OK?”

Well, if the US solar industry is going out, it’s going out with a bang. In yet another email to sail into the CleanTechnica inbox, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reminded us that renewable energy in general, and solar energy in particular, has been saving the Texas grid from imploding under its own weight. Almost the entire Texas grid is managed by ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which has been scrambling for all the in-state power generation resources it can get because Texas can’t depend on inter-state electricity sharing the way other states can (long story).

That’s where the Texas solar industry comes in. “Solar set a new ERCOT record (last Tuesday) on Sept. 9, generating almost half of total demand in the fast-growing Texas electricity market while providing more than 40% of the state’s electricity for seven straight hours, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.,” IEEFA reported earlier this week.

“The latest record is the 17th of 2025, an astounding 7,785 megawatts (MW) higher than the first record of 22,092 MW set Jan. 24,” IEEFA continued. “New data from ERCOT — the Electric Reliability Council of Texas — also highlights solar’s reliability over the summer: For the period from June 1 through Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, more than coal’s 12.5% market share.”

Ohhhh there’s that reliability thing again. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and tell them what you think.

Energy bills are a political flashpoint, and Hochul called affordability “our greatest short-term challenge” in a February letter assailing ConEd’s proposed hikes.","You may have noticed your energy bills going up recently. It’s not just you, and it’s about to get worse.

Electric bills in New York are the highest they’ve been in over a decade, even when taking inflation into account. More than a million households are at least two months behind on payments, owing utilities close to $2 billion. And record numbers of households had their electricity or gas shut off this spring, including more than 61,000 in May — the highest number the Public Utility Law Project (PULP), a decades-old consumer advocacy group, has ever seen.

Anxiety about unaffordable bills only mounted over the summer. Laurie Wheelock, PULP’s executive director, said this August was the group’s busiest month ever, with a surge in calls to its hotline. The top concern on people’s minds: rate hikes.

Utilities are successfully jacking up prices. At the same time, electricity demand is surging: New York, like many other states, is bringing new data centers, high-tech manufacturing, and other energy-hungry industries onto the grid, while also electrifying more home heating and transportation. And President Donald Trump’s onslaught of policies aimed at hindering renewables is only adding fuel to the fire.

Meanwhile, both the federal and state governments are eyeing deep cuts to assistance programs meant to help keep energy bills under control.

What’s behind the surging costs? Here’s what you need to know.

Utility Rate Hikes

Every energy bill in New York breaks down into two main parts: supply, which reflects the costs of producing the energy that you use, and delivery, which reflects what your local utility charges to get that energy to your home.

The delivery side is what’s mainly driven up bills over the last decade, and it’s still the fastest-growing part. It’s set through the state’s well worn “rate case” process: Utilities ask regulators for bill increases to cover their operating costs and pay for new infrastructure. After negotiations, the state’s Public Service Commission, or PSC, approves a compromise deal. Then rates go up, though usually by less than the utility had asked for.

In recent years, utilities have requested far bigger hikes.

“We used to see single-digit rate hikes and now we see double-digit rate hikes,” said Jessica Azulay, executive director of the advocacy group Alliance for a Green Economy. Since the pandemic, several utilities have requested increases of 25 percent or more to their delivery rates — and this year, as much as 39 percent. “That’s a new normal that is unacceptable,” Azulay said.

As of September, some 75 percent of the state’s electric customers and almost half of gas customers had rate hikes pending or recently approved. The latest proposals, from upstate utilities NYSEG and RG&E, would increase electric bills by $33 a month. NYSEG’s proposal would increase gas bills by the same amount — a whopping one-third increase. (Regulators are unlikely to approve the full requests.)

The companies said in July that the hikes were needed “to pay for rebuilding an aging grid and expanding its capacity to meet residents’ and businesses’ service demands,” including making repairs after storms. They said the plan would create more than 1,000 jobs.

PSC spokesperson James Denn said the hikes that the commission approves owe largely to factors outside the state’s control.

Much of New York’s utility infrastructure is getting too old to operate efficiently and safely, and is in urgent need of upgrading. But the cost of those upgrades has spiked “due to inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions, the global push to upgrade electrical infrastructure, and, most recently, the rising risk and uncertainty from tariffs,” Denn said.

Many have blamed New York’s clean energy efforts for the hikes, but official estimates suggest they remain a minor factor. A long-awaited PSC report presented on Thursday found that state climate policies accounted for anywhere from 5 to 9.5 percent of the average household’s electric bill in 2024, or $10 to $12 per month, depending on the utility. (The impact on gas bills was far smaller, at 2 percent or less.)

Those costs straddle both the supply and delivery sides of the bill. They include transmission upgrades aimed at greening the grid, utility programs to switch households to electric appliances like heat pumps, and subsidies for renewable and nuclear energy statewide, among other expenses.

Those expenses are still outweighed by more traditional utility spending. The companies are investing heavily to harden their infrastructure against extreme weather — adapting in part to the impacts of climate change, as efforts to slow it fall ever further behind target. They’re still pouring billions into maintaining and expanding local gas systems, even as homes and businesses use less of the fuel. They’re also hiring more staff, paying higher property taxes, and confronting equipment shortages. The amount New Yorkers are shelling out for the energy transition still looks small by comparison.

Energy Supply Costs Also Growing

The cost of producing energy in the first place is getting more expensive, too — and Trump’s policies could push it up higher.

Trump’s multi-pronged attack on renewables has jeopardized the kinds of energy projects that, in states like New York, are the closest to being built. That’s stifling new supply to the grid, even as demand surges, and increasing reliance on gas.

Under Trump’s July megabill, solar and wind projects will lose a longstanding 30 percent federal tax credit unless they begin construction by mid-2026 or complete it by the end of 2027. That alone will make them more expensive to build. But Trump has also thrown up a slew of other new hurdles to renewable development, rewriting everything from tax rules to bird conservation laws in ways that will make investments riskier, at best. That, too, will come at a cost, experts say.

Tariffs, and the constant threat that they will be increased, add another layer of expense and uncertainty.

All told, Trump’s policies will likely kill a large share of wind and solar projects, particularly in states like New York, where new energy is already challenging and pricey to build. The state Department of Public Service — the agency working alongside the PSC — estimates that the full gamut of Trump’s policy changes will cost New York $60 billion in renewable energy investment.

Developers remain bullish that some projects will survive, but they will come at a premium.

“It just means more expensive power,” said Marguerite Wells, executive director of the renewable energy lobbying group Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Less renewable energy means even greater reliance on gas, which already supplies roughly half of New York’s electricity, and close to two-thirds of its home heating. With fewer alternatives coming onto the grid than expected, New York’s energy markets will likely be hitched to the fuel for years to come.

That means they will also be increasingly tethered to global markets. The US’s gas export capacity is set to more than double by 2028 and continue growing from there, a policy Trump has championed — and a key reason that the US Energy Information Administration expects gas prices to climb sharply again this year after dropping to a historic low in 2024.

The more gas the US sells around the world, the more vulnerable domestic consumers will be to price shocks driven by geopolitical events like Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, said Dennis Wamsted, an analyst at the pro-renewable Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

“In some ways you can’t fault the exporters for passing along those costs,” Wamsted said. “But it does raise the very real question of, what kind of risk are we putting rate payers at or consumers at going forward… if we become more reliant on gas-fired electricity generation?”

The Trump administration has offered a straightforward answer: “drill, baby, drill,” and supply will outpace growing demand to keep prices down.

“Joe Biden’s Green New Scam agenda crushed America’s energy industry with stifling regulations, causing electricity prices to soar by more than 30 percent in just four years,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in an emailed statement. “Beginning on Day One, President Trump began rolling back these policies and unleashed American energy to lower costs for families and businesses.”

Trump’s most direct foray into New York energy politics has been pressuring Governor Kathy Hochul to revive two controversial pipeline projects that the state previously rejected. Backers of the two pipelines argue that they will save consumers money by increasing energy supply to the region.

Some analysts have challenged that claim, pointing to the substantial up-front construction costs. The utility National Grid estimates its downstate gas customers will pay an extra $7.50 per month, on average, to build the NESE pipeline, in exchange for cheaper electricity statewide. A recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis suggests the utility is likely underestimating the upfront costs and exaggerating the savings.

On Thursday, the PSC endorsed the pipeline in an order approving National Grid’s long-term gas plan for New York, saying it was needed for reliability. The pipeline still needs environmental permits from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Even if Trump and his allies succeed in bringing more gas to the northeast, it may only offer a stopgap to the state’s strained energy system. Roughly a quarter of New York’s fossil fuel plants are reaching retirement age in the next few years, according to the state’s grid operator, and numerous hurdles stand in the way of replacing them.

One of the biggest is the supply chain. Wait times for the central component of gas plants — turbines — are as long as seven years.

Moreover, in New York — which is targeting a zero-emissions grid by 2040 — there is not a single new gas plant currently on the table. Even if the state government were to reverse course and begin approving them again, such plants would likely take years to plan, permit, and build.

“Those constraints don’t go away by making it harder to build renewables now,” said Julia Hoos, Head of USA East at the firm Aurora Energy Research; under Trump’s policies, it just becomes harder to build energy in general. Those kinds of supply constraints could contribute to rising costs.

What Is to Be Done?

Energy bills are a political flashpoint, and Hochul called affordability “our greatest short-term challenge” in a February letter assailing ConEd’s proposed hikes. But critics charge that the governor is making the problem worse by cutting a key program to help New Yorkers fix up their homes and cut their bills.

The Empower+ cuts come as the state’s new draft energy plan highlights energy efficiency as a key way to rein in costs and improve quality of life for low- and moderate-income households. “The prospect of massive funding cuts for that program … goes against what the state’s own analysis says needs to happen to help bring down energy bills for households,” said Azulay.

Asked about her record on energy affordability, Hochul’s office touted $1.4 billion in utility bill savings, mainly delivered through Covid-era bailouts; support for rooftop and community solar; and the state’s recent expansion of the Energy Affordability Program, which will give more moderate-income households access to monthly bill discounts funded by utility customers as a whole.

“At a time when the federal government has waged war on renewable energy, the Governor is focused on a all-of-the-above approach to energy to increase supply and drive costs down,” Hochul spokesperson Ken Lovett said in an email.

Some lawmakers are seeking structural reforms to rein in utility profits. The PSC already sets the profit rates that utilities are allowed to earn on their investments; Denn, the spokesperson, said that recent increases were a product of post-pandemic inflation, and that New York keeps utility shareholder returns well below the national average. But critics have argued that state regulators are granting rates far higher than market conditions warrant, allowing utility shareholders to line their pockets at customers’ expense.

A New York bill sponsored by Senator Shellie Mayer and Assemblymember Didi Barrett aims to shave those profits by revamping the accounting that the PSC uses to set them. The bill has passed the Senate three times with bipartisan support, but has yet to gain traction in the Assembly. Hochul hasn’t taken a position on it.

Watchdogs say there are more savings to unlock in other technical aspects of the ratemaking process, known as “rate design.” The negotiations that decide them are close to impenetrable for non-experts, but mounting outrage is inspiring more New Yorkers to try and crack open the process.

“There is definitely a groundswell of concern,” said PULP’s Wheelock. “We go to meetings and we’re getting questions about rate design, like, ‘What is the revenue decoupling mechanism?’ Never had that question before.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47661/3ZCqPgWQlWTg3quTgD3Pne0w9vprEQLx2ZeDyiH3bOo/w%3A820/h%3A546/rt%3Afill/g%3Afp%3A0.5%3A0.5/q%3A90/el%3A1/ahr0chm6ly9zmy51cy1lyxn0ltiuyw1hem9uyxdzlmnvbs9uexnmb2n1cy9syxrllwhpa2vzlnbuzw1758221832.png?h=4bc2b340&itok=l3LPcWyS,N,,2025-09-18 16:02:46.667270

Lobbying & Government.,"Poll: Clean energy popular among everyone, even Republicans - Florida Politics",Janelle Irwin Taylor,,,,,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/756749-poll-clean-energy-popular-among-everyone-even-republicans/,"A new poll shows that Floridians overwhelmingly support clean energy, with about 78% of respondents indicating they prefer a clean alternative.
“Working families and small businesses will continue to feel the pinch of higher electricity prices if Florida is over-reliant on any one energy source,” Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida Executive Director Zachary Colletti said.
But while an overwhelming majority of Republicans support clean energy, there still lies a notable drop-off when it comes to strong support, the poll found.
While 63% say they support clean energy, only 18% of Republicans strongly support it, compared to 44% overall.
And there is a political divide when it comes to nuclear energy, with Republicans supporting restarting previously decommissioned plants more than Democrats, at 75% to just 41%.","A new poll shows that Floridians overwhelmingly support clean energy, with about 78% of respondents indicating they prefer a clean alternative. That includes more than 60% of Republicans.

The poll, taken by Cygnal Aug. 26-27 for the group Conservatives for Clean Energy, found the vast majority of Floridians (82%) are frustrated by rising utility costs, a sentiment likely driving support for alternative energy sources, including solar and nuclear.

Two-thirds of voters (67%) say they are more likely to support a candidate who backs solar energy expansion, while 68% say they are more likely to support candidates who back rooftop solar-friendly policy.

Meanwhile, 62% of respondents say they support expanded production of nuclear energy, including restarting decommissioned plants.

“Working families and small businesses will continue to feel the pinch of higher electricity prices if Florida is over-reliant on any one energy source,” Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida Executive Director Zachary Colletti said. “Florida voters are ready to support leaders who protect their pocketbooks and peace of mind. Expanding solar and getting serious about nuclear are key to delivering both for Floridians.”

About 70% of respondents believe that energy independence is a matter of national security.

The results are likely driven by respondents’ top priorities centering on pocketbook issues, with inflation and cost of living (25%), taxes and government spending (15%) and housing affordability (10%) dominating the top three issues. Pair that with the 82% of respondents who say energy prices are getting more expensive, and it’s easy to see how respondents’ financial concerns are shaping their views.

But while an overwhelming majority of Republicans support clean energy, there still lies a notable drop-off when it comes to strong support, the poll found. While 63% say they support clean energy, only 18% of Republicans strongly support it, compared to 44% overall. Still, 57% of Republicans polled say they are less likely to vote for a candidate who opposes policies that increase U.S. energy production.

And there is a political divide when it comes to nuclear energy, with Republicans supporting restarting previously decommissioned plants more than Democrats, at 75% to just 41%.

The poll provides useful insight ahead of the 2026 Midterms as candidates build their campaigns, indicating potential winning strategies on energy issues.

It also offers insight into the Governor’s race, with a generic Republican candidate dominating at 51% to just 38% for a generic Democrat; The remaining respondents are undecided. It’s worth noting that even though more than 89% of Republicans say they would support a Republican candidate for Governor, 5% say they would support a Democrat and another more than 5% are still unsure.

The poll was taken among 1,000 likely 2026 General Election voters, with a sample consisting of 46% Republicans, 32% Democrats, 18% no-party voters and 2% each who indicated another affiliation or who did not provide information.

Performed in November 2024 and released in September 2025, the study validates that Clean Harbors’ high-temperature, RCRA-permitted incineration process destroys PFAS over 99.9999% effectively, meets or exceeds the strictest EPA emissions standards, and does so at scale.
Key findings: The incineration process was evaluated by stringent standards including OTM-50 and Method 0010 and showed no detectable fluorinated emissions.
What remains to be seen is the pace at which state and federal regulations will integrate validated incineration into mandated PFAS cleanup and disposal frameworks.
Bottom line: Clean Harbors’ joint study with the EPA and DoD provides the strongest evidence yet that PFAS can be safely, effectively and permanently destroyed.","For years, PFAS (“forever chemicals”) have posed a growing public health and environmental concern. Found in firefighting foams, industrial products, water supplies, soils and more, PFAS compounds are difficult to destroy, resist degradation, and have been linked to cancer, immune system disruptions, and other serious health effects. With regulatory and community pressure mounting, the need for safe, verifiable destruction has never been more urgent.

A new study out of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted in concert with the Department of Defense (DoD) and Clean Harbors, offers what may be the most compelling commercial-scale solution yet.

Performed in November 2024 and released in September 2025, the study validates that Clean Harbors’ high-temperature, RCRA-permitted incineration process destroys PFAS over 99.9999% effectively, meets or exceeds the strictest EPA emissions standards, and does so at scale.

Key findings:

The incineration process was evaluated by stringent standards including OTM-50 and Method 0010 and showed no detectable fluorinated emissions.

Ambient air emissions from the process were 2-8X lower than any state or federal limit.

A broad range of PFAS compounds were tested, including AFFF (aqueous film-forming foam) concentrate, PFOA, PFOS, PFBA, PFDA, PFHxA, PFHxS, and “GenX” (HFPO-DA), among others.

Third-party experts reviewed the data independently – Dr. Melvin Keener (CRWI) and Dr. Jens Blotevogel (CSIRO) both affirmed the study’s findings.

Why this matters:

This study represents a milestone in PFAS remediation for several reasons:

Many prior methods promised degradation, containment, or filtration, but few at scale with this level of measurement and third-party validation.

For communities, industries and regulators, proof of permanent destruction rather than long-term containment or recycling means compliance pathways that reduce risk and worry.

Lower emissions, verified under stringent methods, matter not just for regulatory compliance but for public trust and environmental safety.

What remains to be seen is the pace at which state and federal regulations will integrate validated incineration into mandated PFAS cleanup and disposal frameworks.

Bottom line:

Clean Harbors’ joint study with the EPA and DoD provides the strongest evidence yet that PFAS can be safely, effectively and permanently destroyed. For industries grappling with PFAS liability, for communities demanding removal, and for regulatory bodies seeking enforceable solutions, this is the breakthrough many have been waiting for.

“The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs is beyond scientific dispute,” the report says, referring to greenhouse gases.
“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” it says.
The endangerment finding also underlies climate regulations, and the proposal to overturn it came alongside a proposal to revoke car emission rules.
“As we saw in the 16 intervening years since the Endangerment Finding was made, many of the extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected.","In response to the Trump administration repeatedly saying otherwise, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine on Wednesday issued a report that emphasized that climate change’s harms are “beyond scientific dispute.”

The report from the National Academies, which seek to provide science that informs the government, comes as a rebuke to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to overturn a 2009 determination that planet-warming greenhouse gases pose a threat to the public.

“The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs is beyond scientific dispute,” the report says, referring to greenhouse gases.

“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” it says. “The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today’s extremes become tomorrow’s norms.”

The National Academies undertook the report after the EPA proposed to overturn the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which determined that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public health and welfare.

The endangerment finding also underlies climate regulations, and the proposal to overturn it came alongside a proposal to revoke car emission rules.

Shirley Tilghman, chair of the committee that wrote Wednesday’s report, said in a written statement the study was done “with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA … as it considers the status of the endangerment finding.”

“We are hopeful that the evidence summarized here shows the strong base of scientific evidence available to inform sound decision-making,” Tilghman added.

In response, an EPA spokesperson reiterated the administration’s concerns with the Obama-era finding.

“The Endangerment Finding has been used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to justify trillions of dollars of greenhouse gas regulations covering new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines,” the spokesperson said in a written statement.

“As we saw in the 16 intervening years since the Endangerment Finding was made, many of the extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected. EPA welcomes all public comments on the proposal through September 22, 2025, and the agency looks forward to responding to a diverse array of perspectives on this issue,” the statement continued.

In their report, the National Academies concluded the 2009 finding “was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.”

“Changes in climate resulting from human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases harm the welfare of people in the United States,” the report says, pointing to “negative impacts on agricultural crops and livestock,” as well as “climate-related changes in water availability and quality” and harmful algal blooms and other stressors on communities and infrastructure.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/wildfire_climate_change_09112024_AP_AP24255519680761.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 18:03:03.454397

The cost to charge at Level 2 charging stations in Batavia has been reduced from 40 cents to 25 cents per kWh.
The charging stations at the high school are expected to be operational by the end of the month.
Gas-powered vehicles parked at charging stations will be subject to $100 fines and can be towed, regardless of the length of time they are parked.
Police Chief Eric Blowers said a state statute imposes a $75 fine for gas-powered vehicles that park at EV charging stations.","The Batavia City Council has made it less expensive to charge an electric vehicle in town while adding restrictions and fees for prolonged parking at charging stations.

Council members unanimously approved an ordinance during their Monday meeting to reduce charging rates at EV stations within the city and to add loitering fees.

The cost to charge at Level 2 charging stations in Batavia has been reduced from 40 cents to 25 cents per kWh. Batavia’s incoming Level 3 chargers, which operate at a significantly faster rate, will cost 50 cents per kWh.

Batavia has a Level 2 station at the Government Center downtown and is installing Level 3 chargers at Batavia High School and another location that’s yet to be determined. The charging stations at the high school are expected to be operational by the end of the month.

The newly approved ordinance allows for owners of EVs left at Batavia stations after they’re fully charged to be fined $1 per minute for parking, with a maximum fee of $120. That would kick in following a 30-minute grace period allowed for owners to move their EVs when they’re done charging.

Gas-powered vehicles parked at charging stations will be subject to $100 fines and can be towed, regardless of the length of time they are parked.

EV charging is monitored through apps that alert owners once their vehicle is fully powered, which is when the grace period begins.

Council member Alan Wolff asked how the parking at charging stations would be monitored.

Steve Allen, Batavia’s electric superintendent, said if an EV is left plugged in, the time would be shown on the charging equipment. If an owner unplugs a vehicle but leaves it parked there, that timing would have to be monitored through other surveillance measures.

Police Chief Eric Blowers said a state statute imposes a $75 fine for gas-powered vehicles that park at EV charging stations. He said municipalities can increase the fine to $100 and reserve the right to tow those vehicles at the owners’ expense.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b51d4028-cf77-57fe-83dd-0b80f21ee66f&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-09-18 16:03:39.041061

This reduction is aimed at supporting India’s renewable energy targets, job creation, and clean energy transition.

The tax rate rationalisation is expected to lower the costs of clean energy projects, directly benefiting domestic households, farmers, industries, and developers.

The capital cost for utility-scale solar projects, which is typically between Rs35m ($398,493) to Rs40m per megawatt, will now see savings of Rs2m to Rs2.5m per megawatt.

For a 500MW solar park, this equates to cost reductions exceeding Rs1bn, enhancing tariff competitiveness.

The reduction in GST rates is projected to decrease the levelised tariffs for renewable energy, thereby reducing the economic strain on distribution companies.

This could potentially lead to an annual reduction in power procurement expenses across the country, ranging from Rs20bn to Rs30bn.

The initiative will also reduce the expense of installing solar panels on residential rooftops.

Households can expect to save approximately Rs9,000 to Rs10,500 on a standard 3kW rooftop setup, promoting mass uptake through the PM Surya Ghar: Free Electricity Scheme.

Farmers benefitting from the PM-KUSUM scheme will see substantial savings as well. A 5HP solar pump, previously costing about Rs250,000, will now be cheaper by nearly Rs17,500.

With an estimated one million solar pumps, farmers could collectively save Rs17.5bn, making irrigation more affordable and sustainable.

It will also foster economically viable decentralised options such as mini-grids, applications for enhancing livelihoods, and solar-powered water pumps, offering significant benefits for rural and underprivileged areas.

With India’s aim to incorporate approximately 300GW of renewable energy by 2030, even a slight cost decrease of 2-3% could unlock an investment potential of up to Rs1.5tn.

Given that each gigawatt of production generates roughly 5,000 employment opportunities, these changes could facilitate the creation of 500,000 to 700,000 direct and indirect jobs throughout the coming ten years.

Additionally, it is projected that every gigawatt of solar energy capacity can reduce carbon emissions by approximately 1.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). With the streamlining of GST, this could lead to a reduction of up to 70mtpa of emissions annually by 2030.

Key Takeaways

The U.S. interest rate has fluctuated considerably over the decades, reaching above 19% during the early 1980s and later falling to near zero in the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic.

The Federal Reserve made their first interest rate cut of this year of 25 basis points on September 17th, and projects rates to decline to 3.50–3.75% by the end of 2025.

In the U.S., raising or lowering the interest rate is one of the Federal Reserve’s most powerful tools for shaping the economy. It influences everything from borrowing costs for households to global capital flows.

With the Federal Reserve cutting the interest rate for the first time in 2025 this week, this graphic takes a look back at how this cut and rate projections to the end of 2025 look in historical perspective.

This chart shows how the Federal Funds Rate has changed from 1954 to September 2025 with projections through the end of 2025, using data from the Federal Reserve and their latest Summary of Economic Projections.

How the Interest Rate Has Changed Since 1954

Over the past seven decades, the U.S. interest rate has moved through cycles of extreme highs and historic lows.

The table below includes the data of the average interest rate each year since 1954, with the 2025 average including the Federal Reserve’s projections of two additional cuts by the end of the year.

In their most recent interest rate announcement on September 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve announced their first interest rate cut of 2025 of 25 basis points (bps).

The Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections was released alongside the announcement, where more than half of the board members projected at least an additional two 25 bps rate cuts this year.

If these further rate cuts were to manifest, the interest rate would move down from its current target range of 4.00–4.25% to 3.50–3.75%.

The Volcker Era and Double-Digit Rates

The early 1980s marked the most dramatic spike in interest rates.

With inflation climbing into double digits but economic growth slowing (also known as stagflation), the Fed pushed rates above 19%, triggering a recession but eventually restoring price stability.

This remains the highest point in the modern history of U.S. interest rates, and is known as the “Volcker Shock”: when Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker broke the back of rising inflation.

The 2008 Financial Crisis and Pandemic Era’s Near-Zero Rates

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the Fed slashed the interest rate to almost zero. By December 2008, the effective Federal Funds Rate had fallen to the lowest positive range of 0.00–0.25%.

This was the start of a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates that lasted nearly a decade. While the Federal Reserve had engaged in raising the interest rate back up from late 2015 to 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Fed to return to near-zero rates.

During this stretch, the interest rate was slashed to the 0.00–0.25% target range to provide liquidity and a more supportive economic environment amidst an unprecedented global shutdown.

Not long after, the interest rate was rapidly raised in 2022–2023 to a high range of 5.25–5.50% to combat the sharpest surge in inflation in 40 years.

Three rate cuts at the end of 2024 brought the interest rate down to the 4.25–4.50% range for most of 2025, before this most recent cut.

Salary by Education Level in the United States

This was originally posted on our Voronoi app. Download the app for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.

Key Takeaways

Earnings increase with higher levels of education, ranging from a median annual salary of $48,360 for those with just a high school diploma to $122,876 for professional degree holders.

The largest salary jump occurs at the bachelor’s degree level, highlighting the value of a four-year college education.

In the U.S., the connection between education and income is stark, with higher education leading to higher median earnings consistently.

This visualization highlights how median annual salaries change at each successive level of educational attainment in the United States, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2024.

Earnings by Education Level in the U.S. in 2024

Annual median earnings vary significantly across education levels in the U.S., ranging from a median of just $38,376 for those with no high school education to a high of $122,876 for professional degree holders.

The data table below has the annual median salary by education level in the United States for 2024:

Education levelAnnual median earnings Professional degree$122,876 Doctoral degree$118,456 Master's degree$95,680 Bachelor's degree$80,236 Associate's degree$57,148 Some college (no degree)$53,040 High school diploma$48,360 Less than a high school diploma$38,376

Doctoral degree holders in the U.S. earn an annual median of $118,456, and have one of the largest salary differences the previous level of education, earning $22,776 more than masters degree holders (who earn an annual median of $95,680).

The earnings increase of getting a master’s degree after a bachelor’s isn’t as large of a gap at $15,444, due to the relatively high median salary of $80,236 for bachelor’s degree holders.

The Bachelor’s Degree Salary Premium

The most pronounced gap appears between associate and bachelor’s degree holders. Earning a bachelor’s degree adds $23,088 to the median salary compared to an associate degree. That’s a 40% increase over associate degree holders’ annual median salary of $57,148.

This underscores the financial advantage of completing a four-year college program, even if graduate study is not pursued.

While not as large of a dollar increase, earning a high school diploma is also quite valuable, adding $9,984 to annual median earnings.

This ends up being a 26% salary increase over the $38,376 median for those with no high school diploma, and is the second-largest salary increase between education levels after that of the bachelor’s degree.

It’s worth keeping in mind that along with boosting earning power, each level of education also likely improves job stability and long-term career growth.

Aidala,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/proposed-cuts-to-wind-energy-undermine-investment-certainty-across-sectors/,"An earlier executive order also suspended all new offshore wind leasing and permitting, triggering a government-wide review of prior approvals.
These developments are significant not only for the offshore wind industry, but for all sectors that rely on a stable, predictable, permitting and approval process.
The offshore wind cancellations arrive at a moment of declining capital investment in U.S. clean energy.
The wind energy cancellations also risk destabilizing confidence in the energy sector as a whole.
The consequences reach far beyond wind energy — affecting every sector that depends on long-term investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and innovation.","In recent weeks, the Trump Administration has taken a series of actions to curtail federal support for offshore wind development. The most visible step was the U.S. Department of Transportation’s cancellation of roughly $679 million in funding for 12 offshore wind projects across 11 states. In addition, the Administration halted construction of the nearly complete $4 billion Revolution Wind project serving Rhode Island and Connecticut, citing national security concerns. An earlier executive order also suspended all new offshore wind leasing and permitting, triggering a government-wide review of prior approvals. These developments are significant not only for the offshore wind industry, but for all sectors that rely on a stable, predictable, permitting and approval process.

The offshore wind cancellations arrive at a moment of declining capital investment in U.S. clean energy. According to recent reporting, renewable energy investment fell by more than 36 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous six months. While renewables are most directly affected, the broader message is one that resonates across industries: even projects that are well advanced, heavily capitalized, and already employing thousands of workers may be at risk. The implications extend beyond offshore wind. If energy developers, manufacturers, or chemical producers cannot rely on federal approvals to endure from “start to finish,” the result is widespread uncertainty in long-term planning and capital allocation — the true nemesis of business.

Halting projects that are nearly complete raises important questions about government efficiency and stewardship of public funds. Taxpayer dollars have already been allocated to support these projects. Private capital has already been deployed. Labor forces and supply chains are already engaged. Reversals at this stage risk creating stranded assets — facilities, equipment, and infrastructure that may never be used for their intended purpose. The cost is not only financial, but reputational: industries across the economy take note when government approvals no longer provide reliable assurances of project completion.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC) recently underscored the importance of “permitting certainty from start to finish.” Its argument is straightforward: businesses can adapt to new requirements, longer timelines, or higher compliance costs — but they cannot adapt to unpredictability. When a $4 billion project that is more than 80 percent complete can be halted on short notice, it signals to all investors that risk exposure is no longer calculable. That perception chills investment, slows innovation, and drives capital — domestic and international — to markets where regulatory frameworks are viewed as more stable.

The wind energy cancellations also risk destabilizing confidence in the energy sector as a whole. While natural gas and other conventional energy sources may appear insulated, investors understand that regulatory reversals in one segment of the energy economy may presage similar actions elsewhere. Pipeline projects, port expansions, and transmission upgrades are equally vulnerable if the underlying principle — that federal approvals can be relied upon — no longer holds. Customers and contractors who depend on long-term contracts for energy production can no longer count on the security and stability these projects provide. In fact, consumers’ energy prices will likely go up as a result of the offshore wind project’s cancellation.

For states, the fallout is immediate. Governors in California, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have raised concerns about job losses and stranded investments in their regions. Litigation challenging the Administration’s actions is already underway. For policymakers, the lesson is clear: regulatory consistency is as critical as regulatory stringency. Industry stakeholders can and do invest in compliance, innovation, and adaptation. What undermines confidence is not the presence of rules, but the absence of predictability.

As the USCC noted, permitting certainty is a cornerstone of competitiveness. Without it, projects stall, taxpayer dollars are wasted, and private capital flees to more stable markets. The consequences reach far beyond wind energy — affecting every sector that depends on long-term investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and innovation. Both domestic and international capital markets are less likely to get involved in projects that could be cancelled even when they are eighty percent complete. Such policies could cause businesses to opt out of producing products in the United States entirely.

The Administration’s recent actions on offshore wind highlight a broader challenge: balancing evolving policy priorities with the need for regulatory stability. For the energy sector, and indeed for the U.S. economy at large, ensuring that government approvals provide genuine certainty “from start to finish” will be essential to maintaining investment, creating jobs, and achieving long-term energy and economic goals.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-453997027-e1758218428883.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 15:02:19.071323

U.S. policymakers have become increasingly explicit: China’s control of rare earth refining, estimated at 80–90% of global capacity, represents a strategic vulnerability.
“This agreement represents a shared mission to lessen China’s grip on the rare earth ecosystem in the West,” Mr. Ryan said.
Rare earth markets are notoriously cyclical, with prices prone to sharp swings that can challenge even well-prepared producers.
Outlook As autumn approaches, Ucore Rare Metals finds itself in a position of rare leverage.","On the site of a once-quiet Air Force base in central Louisiana, crews are remaking an 80,000-square-foot warehouse into what could become a cornerstone of America’s critical minerals supply chain. Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF), a small Canadian company with big ambitions, broke ground this summer on its Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) in Alexandria. If successful, the facility will separate rare earth oxides used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defense systems — materials long dominated by China.

Since June, Ucore has moved from concept to execution, supported by both government funding and renewed investor interest. Its stock, which traded near C$1.20 in early summer, is now at approximately C$3.44* on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV: UCU) and around US$2.49* on the OTCQX (OTCQX: UURAF). That represents a threefold increase and brings the company close to a multi-year high. The momentum reflects a growing belief that Ucore is positioned to deliver on its long-stated plan to establish a North American rare earth supply chain. (*Stock prices were taken at 10:47 AM EST on September 18, 2025.)

Investor Sentiment Turns Positive

For much of the past decade, Ucore was a speculative name — its Alaska deposit at Bokan Mountain widely discussed but years from development. What changed this summer was tangible progress in Louisiana, backed by Pentagon funding and state incentives. A June financing raised C$15.5 million, earmarked for advancing the SMC and securing offtake agreements. The raise was oversubscribed, and the pricing close to market levels signaled that institutional investors were willing to support the project without deep discounts.

The market’s response has been swift. Trading volumes increased through July and August, with the stock climbing more than 150% from its June lows. Analysts covering the sector note that Ucore’s market capitalization, now approximately C$285 million, still represents anticipation rather than current earnings. But the shift in sentiment suggests that investors see a more credible pathway to commercial revenue — an uncommon level of visibility for a junior mining company.

Fast-Tracking the Louisiana Refinery

The centerpiece of Ucore’s strategy is the Louisiana SMC. The facility will employ the company’s proprietary RapidSX™ technology, an evolution of conventional solvent extraction that promises faster and more efficient separation of rare earth elements. At a demonstration plant in Kingston, Ontario, Ucore has logged thousands of hours refining mixed concentrates, de-risking the technology before commercial deployment.

The Alexandria complex is being built in stages. The first phase targets about 2,000 tons per year of separated oxides by 2026, scaling up to 5,000–7,500 tons by 2028. Company statements suggest an even more ambitious target of 12,000 tons annually by 2027 if financing and market conditions allow. For context, that would represent roughly one-third of projected U.S. demand outside of China.

Location offers strategic advantages. The SMC sits within a Foreign Trade Zone, allowing duty-free import and export of materials. Feedstock could arrive from allied nations such as Australia or Greenland, be processed in Louisiana, and shipped to customers in Japan or the U.S. without tariff penalties. As CEO Pat Ryan shared with me earlier this year, “You can bring inputs from Brazil, process the material, and send it back to Japan for magnet making with no tariff consequence coming in or going out.”

Government as Backstop

What distinguishes Ucore from many rare earth hopefuls is the extent of government backing. In June, the company secured an $18.4 million award from the U.S. Department of Defense, bringing its total Pentagon funding to $22.4 million since 2022. The money will help build and commission the first full-scale RapidSX production line in Louisiana. Unlike traditional loans or equity raises, these funds are non-dilutive, a direct subsidy to accelerate Ucore’s development.

The grant comes under the DoD’s Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment program, which supports projects deemed essential for national security. U.S. policymakers have become increasingly explicit: China’s control of rare earth refining, estimated at 80–90% of global capacity, represents a strategic vulnerability. Earlier this year, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements — samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium — underscoring the fragility of existing supply chains.

Louisiana’s state government has also contributed, providing roughly $15 million in incentives including tax abatements and infrastructure upgrades. Ottawa and Ontario have supplied smaller grants to support the Kingston pilot plant. The cumulative effect is that Ucore is advancing its refinery with a meaningful portion of costs underwritten by public funds.

Securing Feedstock and Partnerships

Processing capacity is only as valuable as the material it can refine. In late August, Ucore announced a preliminary 10-year offtake agreement with Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML), which is developing the Tanbreez rare earth project in Greenland. The agreement would see up to 10,000 tons per year of concentrate shipped to Ucore’s Louisiana and Canadian facilities, beginning as early as 2027. Tanbreez is notable for its high proportion of heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium, metals with critical defense and EV applications.

“This agreement represents a shared mission to lessen China’s grip on the rare earth ecosystem in the West,” Mr. Ryan said. For Critical Metals, the deal validates the Greenland project’s commercial potential, while for Ucore it secures a non-Chinese source of critical feedstock just as its refinery is expected to scale.

Earlier this week, Ucore also partnered with Metallium Ltd. (ASX: MTM | OTCQX: MTMCF) of Australia to explore processing unconventional feedstocks — including magnet scrap, electronic waste, and fluorescent lamp phosphors. Metallium’s “Flash Joule Heating” process can break down such materials into concentrates that RapidSX can then separate into oxides. If proven at scale, this partnership could give Ucore flexibility to diversify inputs and bolster its green credentials by recycling materials already in circulation.

A Broader Geopolitical Contest

The backdrop to Ucore’s progress is a shifting geopolitical landscape. The U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia have all declared rare earths essential to their energy and defense futures. China, meanwhile, has demonstrated a willingness to wield its dominance as a strategic tool. In this context, Ucore’s Louisiana plant is not just a commercial venture but part of a broader industrial policy.

The risks are real. Rare earth markets are notoriously cyclical, with prices prone to sharp swings that can challenge even well-prepared producers. Execution risk also looms: Ucore must bring its refinery online on budget and on schedule, scale a new technology to commercial levels, and secure binding contracts with customers willing to pay for non-Chinese supply.

Yet the opportunity is equally stark. Global demand for rare earth magnets is forecast to grow at more than 8% annually through 2035, fueled by electric vehicles, renewable energy, and advanced defense systems. If Ucore meets its timelines, it could emerge as one of the first Western companies to provide significant heavy rare earth output at scale — a position that would attract not just investors but long-term customers and potentially further government support.

Outlook

As autumn approaches, Ucore Rare Metals finds itself in a position of rare leverage. It is well-funded, backed by the Pentagon and state incentives, and is building a refinery that could start producing within 18 months. Its shares have surged, its partnerships are broadening, and its mission aligns neatly with national security priorities.

For investors, the bet is clear: can a once-obscure junior miner translate policy momentum and pilot-plant success into commercial output at scale? If so, Ucore could become a pivotal player in reshaping how the West sources materials at the heart of the 21st-century economy.",https://investornews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/f1abb47a-0d07-4fc8-91e3-0068de9fce26.png,N,,2025-09-18 16:04:12.604339

That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea.
The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.","ATLANTA (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.

As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.

The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S..

The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it’s still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.

Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.

Hyundai CEO José Muñoz has said the immigration raid will delay opening the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.

Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia’s business advantages would “win out” in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.

“I’ve had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,” Kemp said. “And I’ve had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.”

Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.

“This situation doesn’t change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,” Stubbs wrote. “Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.”

The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.

Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.

The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai’s plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai’s electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.

Hyundai underlined a previous announcement to deepen its investment in robotics and said that by 2027 it would launch extended-range electric vehicles with gasoline motors to extend the range of its electric batteries to more than 600 miles (960 kilometers).",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/preview-1462.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 15:03:09.901293

Lawmakers emphasized growing bipartisan recognition that America’s permitting system needs to be modernized to keep pace with the country’s energy and infrastructure needs.

Fixing a Broken Process

The SPEED Act (Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME)) would update the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the federal law that sets environmental review standards for major projects. Originally intended to ensure careful evaluation of environmental impacts, NEPA has grown into a lengthy and costly process that can stall projects in energy, infrastructure, and technology. The bill would impose clear deadlines for environmental review, limit litigation abuse, and create certainty across projects and administrations.

Committee Chairman and bill sponsor Bruce Westerman (R-AR) noted that the reform is not just about economics, but also about protecting the environment:

“The results of permitting are not only hurting economic development but often times we are missing opportunities to protect and enhance the environment…It is not just people who vote republican coming in my office to tell me that.”

He later added that Congress must seize the opportunity to establish a system that “doesn’t change when the administration changes” and that provides regulatory certainty across sectors.

Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI) added that the existing system is a “bureaucratic maze,” emphasizing that:

“The SPEED Act presents an opportunity to make lasting change, and I hope we can move this bill forward in the House soon.”

Industry Leaders Sound the Alarm

Industry voices have also echoed the need for permitting reform. The American Petroleum Institute (API) unveiled a policy roadmap calling for durable solutions to clear the backlog of stalled projects. API President and CEO Mike Sommers said:

“American energy is ready to go, but Washington’s broken permitting system is standing in the way. As energy demand rises, critical infrastructure to deliver it is stuck behind red tape. It’s time for Congress to act on durable reforms that ensure access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy – because when America builds, America wins.”

API thanked lawmakers on the bill, posting on social media:

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also weighed in, highlighting its support in a post:

The IPAA has also repeatedly stressed the need for permitting reform, highlighting the abuse of NEPA in a recent letter with the Foundation for American Innovation:

“While laws like the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) were written with good intentions, they have evolved into procedural gauntlets. In the 1970s, the NEPA process for highway projects took a mean of 2.2 years to complete. The average time to complete an Environmental Impact Statement and obtain a Record of Decision now takes an average of almost 4 years. The full process is often further slowed because energy projects of all types run into a ‘litigation doom loop’, years of lawsuits and delay that create uncertainty and chill investment. These delays don’t improve environmental outcomes, but they do prevent America from building the infrastructure we need.”

Building Toward Bipartisan Reform

The hearing also made clear that support for reform is not limited to one party or sector. Chairman Westerman told Politico that his goal is to keep the SPEED Act “technology- and project-neutral to create a transparent and fair process.” While debates remain over specific provisions, lawmakers on both sides have acknowledged the need for compromise.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.) expressed interest in advancing permitting reform, noting:

“We need to make it easier to build in this country again.”

Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), a co-sponsor of the SPEED Act, stressed the importance of reforming permitting rules to strike a balance between environmental stewardship and efficient project approvals. He argued that protecting the environment should not require tolerating a yearslong process that is overly complex and ripe for litigation abuse.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-API-TWEET.png,N,,2025-09-18 14:03:22.118763

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein.
This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event.
The SRF Helene funds for western North Carolina towns that have experienced Helene damage will continue to be available through year-round applications until 2026.
The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton, and Asheville.","Governor Josh Stein announced today that five western North Carolina counties will receive more than $86 million in funding for 14 drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency program for disaster-affected states. North Carolina is the first state impacted by Helene to award grants from this program.

The awards require that drinking water and wastewater funds be used to improve flood resilience in systems that were impacted by Hurricane Helene, and septic system funds must be used to improve flood resilience to septic systems in Helene-affected areas.

“Too many people lost access to water when Hurricane Helene struck, and in some places, it took months to be able to guarantee potable water,” said Governor Josh Stein. “These grants will help towns across western North Carolina strengthen their water infrastructure so that it can better withstand future storms.”

“These are the first awards from the $686 million from the Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water, wastewater, and septic system repairs and upgrades in the wake of Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “Importantly, all funded projects must ensure that the systems will be more resilient to future flooding events. Having clean and reliable water is critical for the health of our people. Everyone expects and deserves to turn on the tap and receive water that is safe to drink.”

Notable projects include:

The Town of Gamewell (Caldwell County) will receive $775,200 in Principal Forgiveness (PF) to replace/relocate gravity sewer lines and incorporate resiliency through various measures, including stream bank stabilization. High water from excessive rainfall during Helene caused erosion of the riverway and damaged pipe and support piers.

The Town of Waynesville (Haywood County) will receive $5 million in PF to convert a gravity sewer line to a force main with a new pump station and to relocate an existing junction box outside of the 500-year flood plain.

Town of Drexel (Burke County) will receive $5 million in PF to fortify lines in the floodplain and to convert a treatment unit into an equalization basin. The pump station was flooded during Helene, and installing an equalization basin would help reduce Sanitary Sewer Overflows and provide resiliency.

The City of Morganton (Burke County) and the Town of Drexel (Burke County) individually submitted separate applications for the Morganton-Valdese-Drexel interconnection project. This project will create a new emergency interconnection between the towns of Morganton, Drexel, and Valdese to establish water system resiliency in the wake of an extreme weather event. Drexel will receive $5.1 million for its share of this project. Morganton will receive $10 million in funding for its share.

Junaluska Sanitary District (Haywood County) will receive $10 million to rebuild and provide resilience to withstand floods. The shifting of the Pigeon River due to Helene flooding adversely impacted its old system. The proposed project will replace outdated, undersized, and aged water mains that service more than 300 residential connections along the Pigeon River. These lines are dead-end lines and are not looped or connected to other water mains. New water mains, along with valves, new water supply wells outside of the 500-year flood plain, and installation of backup power will provide resiliency, specifically for Haywood Community Hospital and Haywood County Emergency Services.

Woodfin Sanitary District (Buncombe County) will receive $5 million to install emergency standby power and replace inoperable control valves at the water treatment plant to ensure operators can properly operate and maintain the system during emergencies.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive $5 million in PF to include flood resiliency improvements to three pump stations and to improve approximately 5,600 linear feet of gravity sewer. Generators and flood protection walls will be added, and wet wells and electrical equipment will be elevated.

The Town of Hot Springs (Madison County) will receive an additional $5.2 million to install a new redundant transmission line beneath the French Broad River from the well system to the distribution system and to install a new redundant waterline under Spring Creek to feed the 200,000-gallon water storage tank; to construct a new 200,000-gallon water tank adjacent to an existing tank to provide redundant system storage; to replace approximately 6,000 linear feet of damaged water lines; to rehabilitate and improve the existing supervisory control and data acquisition system to ensure operability and access during flood events; to install radio read meters, which will allow the town to quickly identify water leaks and provide repairs for customers; and to install back-up standby power to increase resiliency.

The Authority is an independent body with primary responsibility for awarding federal and state funding for water infrastructure projects.

The Hurricane Helene funding came from the federal Supplemental Appropriations for Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Hawai’i Wildfires (SA-HMW), referred to in North Carolina as State Revolving Fund (SRF) Helene funds.

The Division will continue to accept applications on a rolling basis for the new federal SRF Helene funds from the 2025 American Relief Act to build resilience to water infrastructure for Hurricane Helene-impacted communities. The SRF Helene funds for western North Carolina towns that have experienced Helene damage will continue to be available through year-round applications until 2026.

Applications received by the dates below will be reviewed and presented at a subsequent SWIA meeting as follows:

First round of applications received by August 1 were presented to SWIA and awarded on September 17.

Applications received by November 3 will be presented to SWIA on December 10, 2025.

Applications received by January 9, 2026, will be presented to SWIA on February 18, 2026.

Applications received by March 2, 2026, will be presented to SWIA on April 15-16, 2026.

Drinking Water SRF Helene and Clean Water SRF Helene funding is available to local government units (LGUs) and nonprofit water corporations (and investor-owned drinking water corporations for the DWSRF) in the form of zero-interest loans and principal forgiveness. Applicants must document impacts from Hurricane Helene and the proposed project must include resiliency with the purpose of reducing flood damage risk and vulnerability to rapid hydraulic change or natural disaster.

The Division of Water Infrastructure conducted four preliminary SRF Helene information sessions for prospective western North Carolina applicants in May in Boone, Hickory, Rutherfordton, and Asheville.

The fourth annual Pocatello EV Expo, put on by the Portneuf Resource Council, will take place from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. Saturday in the south parking lot of the Marshall Public Library. This show will feature up to 20 electric vehicles and hybrids, with the owners on hand to answer questions.

“That’s what we think is the real value in the EV car show. People can talk about their experiences with range, any concerns (like), ‘where can I juice up my vehicle?’ And ‘what about maintenance on the vehicle?’ and those sorts of things,” said Liana Litzsinger, treasurer of the Portneuf Resource Council.

RELATED | Local EV owners to showcase their vehicles at annual expo

Litzsinger said this is an important time for people to learn more about electric vehicles, because tax credits for purchasing them will end on September 30, 10 days after the expo. People who buy an EV before that date can get a $7,500 federal tax credit or $4,000 when purchasing a used EV.

There will be a variety of cars in the expo that meet many different consumer needs. Some of these vehicles will be:

2025 Rivian R1S

2025 GMC Hummer SUV

2026 KIA EV9

To date, 19 cars are registered for the show.

Speakers for the event include Mayor Brian Blad and a representative from Yellowstone-Teton Clean Cities starting at 10 a.m.

Both owners and representatives of car dealerships with electric vehicles will be present at the expo, available to talk to attendees about the vehicles, and address any commonly held misconceptions about them. Litzsinger also went on Sustainable Idaho, a KISU radio program, on September 16 to talk about the car show, as well as address misconceptions.

“(The owners) give you that boots-on-the-ground information that maybe is causing a potential EV owner to give pause,” Litzsinger said.

She also pointed out that there’s not many other opportunities to see such a great variety of electric vehicles and hybrids in one place.

DEEP Approves Three-Year Energy Savings Plan for Connecticut

The 2025-2027 Conservation & Load Management Plan Guides the State’s Energy Efficiency Programs, Helping Residents and Businesses Save on Their Energy Bills

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has issued its Final Determination on the 2025-2027 Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) Plan, a comprehensive strategy which guides the priorities, design, and incentives for Connecticut’s energy efficiency and demand management programs. These programs, administered by Eversource and Avangrid under the brand name Energize Connecticutsm, drive down energy costs by supporting efficient building upgrades such as insulation, air sealing, heating and cooling system improvements, and building controls and industrial process improvements for businesses.

Since energy efficiency is cheaper than the cost of supply and reduces the need for infrastructure upgrades, it reduces costs for all utility ratepayers. The 2025-2027 C&LM Plan will deliver $2.35 billion in lifetime benefits to Connecticut residents, municipalities, and businesses through a $705 million investment (that’s a return of $3.30 for every dollar invested). In 2024, the programs completed over 29,000 weatherization projects in residential homes, and completed energy upgrades in over 3,800 businesses. The C&LM programs invested $238.9 million that year, which delivered $408.2 million in lifetime bill savings to participating Connecticut residents, municipalities, and businesses.

Savings Available to Residents and Businesses

The average residential customer who participates in the C&LM residential weatherization programs receives $1,129 of value in services and achieves lifetime average savings of $2,068 on their home energy bills.

There are significant energy savings benefits for participating businesses as well. For example, small businesses in Connecticut receive an average of over $9,500 in services and achieve an average of over $35,000 in lifetime savings on their energy bills.

All utility ratepayers benefit from these programs. For example, the cost of electric supply is nearly double the cost of energy efficiency. By reducing the need to purchase more expensive energy supply and reducing peak demand, these programs lower costs on everyone’s natural gas and electric bills and also improve grid resilience.

“Energy efficiency remains Connecticut’s lowest cost energy resource, and the most direct action residents and businesses can take to lower their energy bills,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “At significantly less than the cost of energy supply, investing in building efficiency is a win-win-win for program participants, all Connecticut ratepayers, and the environment.”

Increased Access and Transparency

The 2025-27 C&LM Plan also advances ongoing efforts by DEEP, the EEB, and the Utilities to ensure ease of access and transparency of program data and reporting. Work on revamping the existing Energy Efficiency Dashboard is already underway, and the updated version is expected to go live in 2026. The new program dashboard will provide stakeholders with a user-friendly platform where they may gather a wide variety of programmatic data to assess program performance. In addition, this Plan supports continued improvements to information provided to customers at the time of their energy assessments. Beginning in 2026, customers will be provided with a bill impact analysis which will further assist them in the decision-making process when considering energy efficiency upgrades.

Additional Program Benefits

DEEP’s Determination finds that the 2025-2027 C&LM Plan, approved with conditions by the Energy Efficiency Board and as amended by DEEP, positions Connecticut for continued success in delivering energy savings and improved affordability to ratepayers. Beyond direct bill savings, participants can expect to improve building comfort and indoor air quality while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Local contractors install the building upgrades supported by Energize CT, and serve as a vital part of Connecticut’s skilled economy. In 2024, Connecticut supported an energy efficiency workforce of nearly 35,000 professionals, many of which can be found on the insulation installers network and heat pump installers network.

What stakeholders are saying about the C&LM Plan and CT’s Energy Efficiency Programs:

""Eversource is proud to help administer Connecticut’s energy efficiency programs, which in 2024 have generated over $400 million in lifetime savings for customers,"" says Vice President of Energy Efficiency and Electric Mobility for Eversource, Tilak Subrahmanian. ""As a Sponsor of Energize Connecticut, we’re committed to helping residents, businesses and municipalities across the state lower their energy use and bills, while enhancing grid reliability and resiliency.""

Anthony Kosior, Energy Efficiency Board Chair, said, “As Chair, I wish to formally recognize the hard work and dedication of the volunteer members of the Energy Efficiency Board, whose contributions played a critical role in the development of this three-year Plan. It has been a distinct privilege to collaborate and work alongside such engaged and knowledgeable individuals in pursuit of our shared mission. I look forward to continuing to guide these programs through equitable implementation that maximizes program benefits, strengthens energy efficiency, and enhances affordability for all Connecticut ratepayers.”

Vivian Perez, Co-owner of HE Energy Solutions, said, “As a qualified contractor working in the field serving residential customers for over 15 years, I can attest to the importance of these programs in helping people save money on their energy bills, enhance home safety, and improve the comfort of their homes. We consistently receive positive feedback from our customers about the programs and the services that we provide. Funding for these programs allows our company to develop and maintain a highly skilled and technically competent workforce, and also helps support good paying jobs here in Connecticut.”

DEEP encourages all ratepayers to participate in these programs. To get started, schedule an appointment with a qualified C&LM program contractor through the EnergizeCT.com website or by calling 877-WISE-USE. Until December 31, 2025, the normal $75 co-pay for a home energy assessment has been waived, so it’s a great time to get started. Plus, federal tax credits for technologies like heat pumps and insulation upgrades remain available only through the end of 2025, so now is a good time to maximize savings.
