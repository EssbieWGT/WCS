Europe is on track to surpass the US in total climate-tech capital deployed, while India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are scaling projects faster than many developed markets.

Europe’s Policy Engine and India’s Clean-Energy Breakthrough Lead the Shift

Sightline’s findings highlight Europe’s accelerating industrial transition. The region now accounts for 55% of global low-carbon cement capacity in development and 70% of projects under construction, driven by the EU carbon price and the forthcoming CBAM border-adjustment mechanism. Coordinated CO2 transport and storage networks are also creating the backbone for deep industrial decarbonization.

India emerges as the standout performer in emerging economies, ranking third worldwide in ammonia capacity (25 Mt/yr) and second in advanced nuclear (17 GW).wing deployment in wealthier nations.

Across the Global South, megaprojects are defining the next chapter of clean-energy industrialization.

Saudi Arabia’s $500 billion NEOM project is reshaping regional energy systems; Chile, Oman, Kazakhstan, and Mauritania are racing to supply Europe with low-carbon ammonia; and Singapore and Latin America are converting waste streams, biomass, and interconnection programs into competitive supply chains.

Sightline argues that deployment success increasingly hinges on governance rather than technology. Regions with coordinated planning, whether Central America’s interconnection programs or Europe’s CO2 hubs, are capturing investment and accelerating commercialization.

“While policymakers are increasingly focused on growth and energy security, in many cases those goals align with climate,” said Kim Zou, Sightline CEO. “To many of these economies, security is more than just energy.”

Power expects a 5.2% decrease in overall vehicle sales this month in the US, with the total figures reaching below 1.26 million units.
Besides BEVs, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) are also expected to decline slightly, dropping 1.4 percentage points to 1.1% of US vehicle sales.","J.D. Power released on Thursday a new report estimating that US electric vehicle sales will drop 37.6% year over year in November, continuing the decline triggered by the EV tax credit deadline.

According to the data analysis firm, battery electric vehicles (BEV) are expected to represent 6% of all vehicle sales in November.

While the figures are consistent with October’s estimates, they are well below the 12.9% recorded in September, the firm noted.

Thomas King, J.D. Power’s President of OEM Solutions, commented on the results, saying that the anticipation of the EV credit deadline prompted consumers to “accelerate buying decisions,” which has caused sales to decline since October.

“Now, two months after the credit expired, the industry continues to feel the effect of those accelerated purchases,” he wrote.

Pricing Strategy

According to Tyson Jominy, Senior VP of OEM Customer Success, pricing trends further highlight the evolving EV landscape, as average prices on electric vehicles have risen 14% from November 2024.

EV prices have surged by $6,500 year over year to $52,400, making them the second most expensive powertrain after PHEVs.

ICE vehicles average $46,000 — about $8,000 lower — while traditional hybrids remain the most affordable option at $42,200.

“As the market adjusts to life without federal tax credits, manufacturers will need to rethink go-to-market strategies to balance affordability, profitability, and consumer demand in this new paradigm,” Jominy wrote.

EV Discounts

US automakers are still adjusting after several policy changes, including the expiration of the EV tax credit and the impact of tariffs on the overall market.

Along with these, Thomas King further noted that “evolving fuel economy requirements, along with the transition to the new model year” also contribute to “some distortions in typical seasonal discount patterns.”

J.D. Power expects discounts on EVs to average $11,689 in November, up $260 from November 2024 but down $928 from October 2025.

These figures highly contrast with estimates for non-EVs, which are projected at $2,960, an increase of $161 from a year ago.

Several automakers have introduced new discounts and benefits to try to lower the impact of the consumer credit expiry.

These include offering the $7,500 discount — the same value as the credit — on the final pricing of the vehicle, as EV maker Lucid Motors has done.

General Motors and Ford also announced that they would “keep” offering the value to consumers buying electric vehicles, but then stepped back and began offering other discounts, such as Ford‘s 0% financing rate for contracts of up to 72 months.

Leasing

The scenario is also changing for leasing contracts, which EV makers like Rivian have depended on, since the price cap for the tax credit was higher for leases than for purchases.

To qualify for the tax credit when purchasing an electric vehicle, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) could not exceed $88,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehicles, such as sedans.

In November, leasing has declined 12% from a year ago, trending at 54%.

“Leasing remains a critical lever for EV adoption,” Tyson Jominy said, adding that it far outpaces leasing on ICE vehicles — at 20% — and hybrids — at 15%.

“While EV incentive spending has moderated compared to a year ago, the reliance on leasing and discounts underscores the challenges automakers face.”

Other Powertrains

J.D. Power expects a 5.2% decrease in overall vehicle sales this month in the US, with the total figures reaching below 1.26 million units.

Besides BEVs, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) are also expected to decline slightly, dropping 1.4 percentage points to 1.1% of US vehicle sales.

Regular hybrids (HEV), however, are projected to rise by 3.6 percentage points, reaching a 14.5% market share.

Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are likely to grow as well, making up 77.5% of sales — an increase of 2.3 percentage points.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rivian_Charging_03.webp,N,,2025-11-21 23:58:40.615119

First Solar's investment is bringing hundreds of great, high-quality American manufacturing jobs in the community.” It’s another step in First Solar’s rapid growth across the United States.
Ohio-based Ice Industries recently celebrated the grand opening of its $6 million manufacturing facility in Jefferson Davis Parish, which will produce steel backrails for First Solar's photovoltaic panels.
The idea to bring the facility to south Louisiana wasn't without its hurdles, he added.
Level playing field It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing that allowed First Solar to outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.","When Georges Antoun came to Louisiana from Lebanon in the early 1980s, he needed money.

The country was entering an oil crisis, and cities along the Gulf Coast — especially places like Lafayette that depended on oil and gas jobs — felt the hit first.

As families moved to larger cities like Houston in search of work, Antoun began offering a service: For a fee, he’d drive their moving trucks back to Louisiana.

It's no secret that Louisiana has long lost talent to its western neighbor and has sought ways to entice them back.

The opening of First Solar's $1.1 billion solar panel manufacturing facility near New Iberia has allowed Antoun, now the company's chief commercial officer, to have conversations with families who have chosen to return to Louisiana to work at the facility.

The 2.4 million-square-foot mega complex is one of the largest investments in the Acadiana region and is expected to provide more than 800 jobs by the end of 2025.

Two years in the making

When the site selection process began for First Solar to find its next manufacturing facility, leaders in Iberia Parish and Acadiana got to work.

There were at least 10 sites in the running to land billion-dollar project that would bring hundreds of jobs. Two of them were out of the country. When the Iberia Parish site made the cut for the final three, things got interesting.

“That’s when we really had to put on our championship jackets and really work hard,"" said Mike Tarantino, ppresident and CEO of the Iberia Industrial Development Foundation. ""We’re so happy First Solar chose us. We’re so excited to see this plant come to fruition.”

On Friday, First Solar’s leadership team along with local elected officials and other leaders celebrated the company’s inauguration at its New Iberia plant, opening its 2.4 million square foot building — now the largest facility under one roof in Louisiana — that represents its $1.1 billion investment in south Louisiana.

It marked the end of a two-year process since it was announced in August 2023. Now the company will employ 826 and offer an average compensation package of $90,000.

The opening is a huge win for the region and the state, said Millard Mulé, policy director for Gov. Jeff Landry. “It’s a huge win for our state’s workers, and it’s a huge win for Louisiana’s economy. First Solar's investment is bringing hundreds of great, high-quality American manufacturing jobs in the community.”

It’s another step in First Solar’s rapid growth across the United States. When it announced plans to locate in Iberia Parish, the news was that it would be its fifth facility in the country and have a payroll of at least $40 million.

The plant opened in July, months ahead of schedule. Last week it announced plans to open a similar plant in South Carolina, its ninth overall.

The company will produce its Series 7 modules using American materials, including glass from Illinois and Ohio along with steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

Economic dividends

The Louisiana investment is already paying dividends, with Acadiana manufacturers like Noble Plastics announcing in September that it would undergo an $8.5 million expansion to supply the New Iberia location. Ohio-based Ice Industries recently celebrated the grand opening of its $6 million manufacturing facility in Jefferson Davis Parish, which will produce steel backrails for First Solar's photovoltaic panels.

""You feel the impact immediately, ""Antoun said. ""I'm very proud, given that I'm a Louisiana boy. ""

The idea to bring the facility to south Louisiana wasn't without its hurdles, he added. The state, known for its damaging hurricanes and flooding, at first made the board uneasy, but it had one thing going for it — a highly skilled, easily transferable workforce.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette and South Louisiana Community College were also eager to help win over the company, providing a curriculum and simulated training for new hires, and tapping the university for a large portion of its workforce.

""Pushback is normal,"" he said. ""Louisiana is a tough place to build. South Louisiana, we get a few hurricanes here and there. Flooding, tax-wise, insurance-wise. This took a bit of doing and bringing it here. But the company was committed to drive it in here.""

""(UL-Lafayette) produces a tremendous amount of engineers and technical degrees, and a lot of folks don't want to leave the area. They want to stay here.""

Level playing field

It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing that allowed First Solar to outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.

“A level playing field — that’s all we need,” he said. “American workers can out-innovate and out-compete if given the opportunity. We're incredibly proud to inaugurate this facility as a symbol of American energy dominance and re-industrialization.”

The plant will also utilize artificial intelligence by using computer vision and deep learning to quickly detect defects in its products during production, officials said. Its technicians and operators can use AI tools to make operating adjustments and guide their decision making.

First Solar, which has opened facilities in other similar-sized markets, expected to employ 5,500 people by the end of next year and have invested $4.5 billion in American manufacturing.

“We’ve been able to be successful to go into communities, in some cases, that other companies have left,” Widmar said. “Our factory that we put in Alabama, there was a paper mill there. Those guys went to China. We went back into that community, revived it and now it’s thriving. That’s what we want to do.”

The New Iberia location can produce up to 3.5 GW worth of solar panels annually.

""You're going to see us throttle down, throttle up. We're trying to react to the market,"" Antoun said. ""We've been on a tremendous growth over the past 10 years. Now we're at a point where we need to understand what our friends in Washington will do and what certainties they will put.""

The company will also provide high-paying jobs averaging $80,000 to $90,000, totaling $75 million in annual labor income, according to data collected by the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center at UL.

Antoun also believes the company will likely continue its rapid growth as the largest solar panel manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere. Just seven years ago, the company could produce around 2.5 gigawatts of solar panels a year, compared to the 17.7 GW it expects to create once the South Carolina facility is operational.

President Donald Trump has made his distaste for renewable energy well known over the years, going as far as sunsetting Biden-era solar tax credits earlier than they were set to expire. The decision killed dozens of early-stage utility-scale solar projects planned for Louisiana.

But Trump's marquee One Big Beautiful Bill has produced ""tailwinds"" for the 100% American-made company, Proenca said, adding that First Solar is one of the only solar companies listed on the White House's investment list, which shows domestic corporate investment.

""Can we survive without incentives? The answer is yes,"" Antoun said.

In an energy-hungry America, Antoun said, solar remains the cheapest and most quickly deployable form of energy.

""Everybody is looking for power as a country, as the U.S.,"" he said. ""We have no spare power. Is it solar? Is it natural gas? Is it coal? Is it nuke? Look, it's all of the above.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/1b/11b94004-c940-59ab-a7d6-58bfcd64dd42/6920e0f72bd8d.image.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-21 19:59:39.286260

The approved actions include comprehensive updates to air quality regulations and the State Implementation Plan, while strategically directing state resources.
“Clean air is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable community,” said Michael Ogletree, the senior director of state air quality programs.
Gasoline-fueled equipment and vehicles, oil and gas operations, and manufacturing facilities are large sources of ozone precursors in Colorado.
Following this request, the commission approved new updates to several Colorado Air Quality Control Commission Regulations, targeting sectors emitting high levels of ozone pollution precursors.","Denver (Nov. 21, 2025): The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission has approved new measures that will drive a 50% reduction in air pollution emissions that form ground-level ozone pollution from upstream oil and gas operations by 2030, compared to 2017 levels. The approved actions include comprehensive updates to air quality regulations and the State Implementation Plan, while strategically directing state resources. The measures mark another significant step toward cleaner air for all Coloradans.

“Clean air is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable community,” said Michael Ogletree, the senior director of state air quality programs. “With these strategic actions, the state reaffirms its commitment to protecting the health of our residents and the environment for future generations to come.”

Ground-level ozone pollution is a harmful air pollutant that can affect lung health, particularly for children, seniors, and those with respiratory conditions. It forms at ground-level when pollutants known as “ozone precursors” react in heat and sunlight. Emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are ozone precursors. Gasoline-fueled equipment and vehicles, oil and gas operations, and manufacturing facilities are large sources of ozone precursors in Colorado.

In March 2023, the Governor directed state agencies to develop new rules to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from upstream oil and gas operations by 30% in 2025 and 50% by 2030 in the parts of Colorado that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution, which are known as ozone nonattainment areas. Following this request, the commission approved new updates to several Colorado Air Quality Control Commission Regulations, targeting sectors emitting high levels of ozone pollution precursors. These include:

Regulation 7: Extending the nitrogen oxide intensity program, expanding leak detection and repair program requirements for oil and gas operations, including storage and transferring processes.

Regulation 11: Identifying more vehicles that emit high levels of ozone precursors.

Regulation 25: Limiting volatile organic compounds for coating materials in aerospace.

Regulation 26: Strengthening emissions controls for combustion equipment and industrial waste in northern Weld County.

The commission included many of the regulatory updates in changes to Colorado's State Implementation Plan. The plan outlines actions that Colorado is taking to reduce air pollution in the ozone nonattainment areas. Additionally, the updated plan allows for further technical analysis to support future policies reducing ground-level ozone.

The commission also revised administrative protocols and regulatory language. These changes will make ozone pollution-reducing programs, such as the federally required vehicle emissions testing program, sustainable over the long term, correct outdated language to align with current state and federal requirements, and revise modeling and emissions credit rules to make compliance easier.

The commission approved a strategic proposal to proactively reclassify portions of the state as nonattainment for the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone. The reclassification would impact a smaller section of northern Weld County. If the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approves the voluntary reclassification request, this would enable the state to focus additional resources on reducing emissions without the burden of administrative tasks.

Colorado is committed to continuing its work on reducing emissions within its control. Learn more about the actions the state is taking to work towards meeting federal ozone pollution standards.

The EV maker's parent company, Bollinger Innovations, delisted from the Nasdaq Composite stock market index in October.

Bollinger Motors, an Oak Park-based electric vehicle start-up, is closing after a long slog of poor performance, never quite getting off the ground.

According to emails reviewed by the Detroit Free Press, sent by Bollinger's Human Resources Director, Helen Watson, the embattled EV maker's last day of business was Friday, Nov. 21.

""We received word late last night that the day has arrived, we are to officially close the doors of Bollinger Motors, effective today, November 21st, 2025,"" the email from Watson said.

On Wednesday, Nov. 19, the Free Press reported that Bollinger was struggling to meet payroll. The EV maker currently has 59 claims of unpaid wages pending with the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, a department spokesperson confirmed.

Days later, the company is shuttering operations.

Watson told employees in the email that David Michery, the CEO of Bollinger Innovations (Bollinger Motors' parent company), will ""make us whole with regards to the remaining monies"" that went unpaid as the company missed payroll for the last two pay periods.

""I am working on creating checks for the 10/31/2025 payroll and believe they will be in hand on Monday,"" Watson wrote. ""It is the end of an era but one you should all be very proud of.""

Bollinger Motors' website, as of late Nov. 21, still reflects the brand's commitment to building ""the most bad-ass electric commercial trucks on the planet.""

Bollinger Motors was founded in 2015 and built vehicles in Livonia, through Roush Industries, and is headquartered in Oak Park.

The company's site lists a chassis cab truck, the B4, as available for order, as well as two boxy SUV prototypes, the B1 and B2. A larger chassis cab truck, the B5, appears to be slated for release in 2026.

In March, the company's founder and namesake, Robert Bollinger — who had left the company — sued over a $10 million loan he gave the company the previous October. Robert Bollinger alleged the company was broke and sought a receivership to handle repayment of his loan. The company exited the receivership in June.

At least six suppliers have taken legal action against Bollinger this year to settle more than $5 million in overdue bills, according to Crain's Detroit Business.

Michery, the CEO of Bollinger's parent company, took over as the leader of Bollinger Motors in June. Michery rebranded his own California-based EV start-up, Mullen Automotive, to the Bollinger name, pulling all brands under the ""Bollinger Innovations"" umbrella.

Now Bollinger Motors, the maker of the chassis trucks and SUV prototypes, is closed for good. Bollinger Innovations has not closed.

On Sept. 23, Bollinger Innovations announced via an online news release that it would no longer perform reverse stock splits, a tactic used to amalgamate several cheaper shares of a stock into one more valuable share of a stock, as a method of staying on the Nasdaq Composite stock market index. Bollinger Innovations had undergone at least six reverse stock splits during the last 12 months, according to company announcements.

The company delisted from the Nasdaq Composite stock market index on Oct. 13 after dropping below the threshold of $1 per share.

Keeping Violent Criminals Off D.C.’s Streets ✅

Currently, the District of Columbia has a cashless bail policy that prohibits using cash bail as a condition for pre-trial release. This reckless policy allows soft-on-crime progressive judges to release dangerous criminals onto the streets of D.C. with only a promise to not re-offend and show up for their future court date, resulting in multiple arrests and putting public safety at risk.

We cannot allow dangerous criminals to roam the streets freely and threaten the safety of everyone in our nation’s capital while they await trial. It’s past time for D.C. to abandon its soft-on-crime policies and make sure those charged with committing violent crimes remain behind bars to ensure the safety of law-abidding Americans.

This week, House Republicans continued our fight to make D.C. safe for visitors and residents by passing legislation that keeps violent and dangerous criminals off our streets. Our bill amends the current D.C. Code to mandate the detention of individuals charged with violent and dangerous offenses and implement cash bail for crimes that threaten public safety, such as aggravated assault and obstruction of justice. This legislation codifies Executive Action taken by President Trump to clean up D.C. crime and make our nation’s capital safe again.

Rep. Elise Stefanik’s legislation, H.R. 5214, the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act, amends D.C.’s pre-trial release and detention processes to require mandatory pre-trial detention for defendants charged with violent crimes and for cash bail or bail bonds for defendants charged with certain crimes concerning public safety and order.

“New Yorkers know that Kathy Hochul’s failed bail reform has unleashed a crime wave across our state by emboldening violent criminals and putting law-abiding New Yorkers in harm’s way. Kathy Hochul's failed bail reform has literally caused murders, assaults, rapes, and heinous crimes to be committed against law abiding New Yorkers. As the Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul continues to fuel her crime crisis and wage war on our corrections system by closing more prisons, she has made clear she will always side with criminals over law abiding New Yorkers,” said Rep. Stefanik. “Throughout my time in Congress, I have fought for the safety of New Yorkers and the support of our brave law enforcement. This week I proudly voted to end cashless bail in D.C which Congress has jurisdiction over.”

What Members Said:

Supporting Police Officers and Cleaning Up our Nation’s Capital ✅

While crime skyrocketed in D.C., Democrats went after the police working to protect the community instead of the criminals putting Americans at risk. The D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 allows police officers to be targeted by protestors, bans officers from watching body-camera footage when writing initial incident reports, demands a jury consider if an officer consulted with mental health, behavioral health, or social workers prior to use of deadly force, dismisses officers and police union representatives from the Police Complaints Board, and strips officers of collective bargaining rights regarding discipline.

Under the D.C. Council’s emergency legislative powers, these harmful policies have been in place since 2020; meanwhile, D.C. police staffing reached the half-century low as homicides rose to their highest number since 1997. Additionally, juvenile crime in the District has reached historic levels while truancy grows.

Congress has a duty to oversee the governance of D.C. and make sure the MPD is able to effectively fight crime and keep Washingtonians and visitors safe. President Trump has taken significant strides to clean up D.C. streets, and House Republicans are likewise committed to restoring law and order in the District. This week, we passed legislation to reverse dangerous anti-police measures in the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 to deliver the support our law enforcement needs.

Rep. Andrew Clyde’s legislation, H.R. 5107, the Common-Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability Now in DC (CLEAN DC) Act, repeals the D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 which placed harmful and burdensome requirements on the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.

“For years, the D.C. City Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2022 has prevented our men and women in blue from effectively protecting Americans in our nation’s capital, hindered the MPD’s ability to recruit and retain officers, and exacerbated Washington’s crime crisis,” said Rep. Clyde. “I’m incredibly pleased that my commonsense legislation to repeal this anti-police law passed with bipartisan support, and I look forward to a similar outcome in the Senate. By eliminating the D.C. Council’s misguided law, the CLEAN D.C. Act strengthens and codifies President Trump’s successful efforts to restore law and order in Washington. While Joe Biden foolishly vetoed my legislation in 2023, I look forward to advancing the CLEAN D.C. Act to President Trump’s desk for his signature to continue delivering on our shared goal of Making D.C. Safe Again.”

What Members Said:

Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism ✅

Socialism is one of the most destructive ideologies in world history, time and time again proving itself to be a failed experiment that only leads to communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships. More than 100 million people have been killed as a result of the mass murders and famines that accompany failed socialist states, including tens of millions of people during the Bolshevik Revolution, between 15 and 55 million people who died of starvation in the wake of famine caused by China’s Great Leap Forward, at least 3.5 million people who have starved in North Korea, and more.

Despite the proven dangers of socialism, America is seeing a troubling rise in the harmful ideology, especially with our youth – most recently culminating in the election of radical socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. Since 2016, more Democrats have held positive views of socialism than of capitalism, with 66 percent of Democrats now viewing socialism favorably, while only 42 percent view capitalism favorably. Additionally, 62 percent of Americans between the ages 18 to 29 hold a favorable view of socialism, and 34 percent of communism.

Socialism and the abuses it leads to go against everything our Founding Fathers stood for. We cannot allow history to be ignored and the threat of socialism to grow unchallenged in America. House Republicans passed legislation that denounces the horrors of socialism and reaffirms our commitment to uphold the American ideals of freedom, democracy, and the pursuit of happiness.

H. Con. Res. 58, introduced by Congresswoman Maria Salazar, describes the horrors perpetrated by socialist regimes, denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.

“Socialism is a lie. It has never delivered justice or equality, only fear, censorship, poverty, and broken nations. I represent thousands of families who fled their homelands because socialist regimes promised paradise and delivered prisons,” said Rep. Salazar. “Today, the House is sending a clear message: we will never allow socialism’s failed, destructive ideology to take root in the United States. America must remain the beacon of freedom that exposes socialism’s lies and defends the God-given rights of every individual.”",https://www.majorityleader.gov/images/majorityleader-meta.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 21:00:46.441842

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president, manufacturing operations.
Toyota West Virginia assembles more than one million engines, transmissions and hybrid transaxles annually and represents a $3.3 billion investment, the company said.

Toyota Missouri: $57.1 Million, 57 Jobs Toyota’s casting plant in Troy, Missouri, will add 57 jobs and a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles.","Toyota’s U.S. manufacturing presence is expanding again to meet growing demand for hybrid vehicles, company officials stated in a press release. As a part of Toyota’s recent commitment to invest up to $10 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, the company announced a $912 million investment and 252 new jobs across five manufacturing plants to increase hybrid capacity and bring hybrid-electric Corollas to its production lineup.

This investment in Toyota’s plants in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri further builds on the company’s ongoing commitment to reinvesting profits in its U.S. operations, noted the release.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” said Kevin Voelkel, senior vice president, manufacturing operations. “Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”

Toyota’s State-by-State Investments

Toyota West Virginia: $453 Million, 80 Jobs

Toyota’s Buffalo, West Virginia, plant will add 80 jobs to increase assembly of 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators. The expansion, which will begin production in 2027, also includes new shift patterns for greater efficiency. Toyota West Virginia assembles more than one million engines, transmissions and hybrid transaxles annually and represents a $3.3 billion investment, the company said.

Toyota Kentucky: $204.4 Million, 82 Jobs

Located in Georgetown, Kentucky, Toyota’s largest plant globally will add 82 jobs and install an all-new machining line for 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines by 2027. Toyota says the powertrain facility can assemble up to 700,000 units annually. Toyota Kentucky employs nearly 10,000 team members and represents an investment exceeding $11 billion.

Toyota Mississippi: $125 Million

Toyota’s Blue Springs, Mississippi, plant will add the hybrid-electric Corolla, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled in the U.S. The plant employs 2,400 people and represents a $1.3 billion investment.

Toyota Tennessee: $71.4 Million, 33 Jobs

Toyota’s casting plant in Jackson, Tennessee, will add 33 jobs to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases and housings and engine blocks for hybrid vehicles. The investment includes three all-new production lines and will increase production capacity by nearly 500,000 units annually. Production on the new lines will start in 2027 and 2028. The plant represents a $497 million investment.

Toyota Missouri: $57.1 Million, 57 Jobs

Toyota’s casting plant in Troy, Missouri, will add 57 jobs and a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles. The new line, which will start production in 2027, will increase plant capacity by more than 200,000 cylinder heads annually and bring the total investment to $629 million.

Toyota’s Commitment to the US

Toyota says this investment supports its broader goal to invest up to $10 billion over five years in U.S. manufacturing. Currently, Toyota assembles about half of the vehicles it sells in the U.S., with North American manufacturing facilities assembling more than three-quarters (76%) of the vehicles it sells in the U.S.

Toyota’s multi-pathway powertrain approach continues to drive steady growth in electrified vehicles, including hybrids, plug-ins and all-electric, which now account for nearly 50% of the company’s U.S. sales, officials stated.

“We’re proud of our plant’s continued growth and honored to help lead Toyota’s transition into a mobility company,” said Alivia Luikart, team member, Toyota West Virginia. “Our future is bright, and it’s rewarding to know that our company has faith in our ability and trusts our team to drive Toyota forward.”

Toyota’s Driving Possibilities Initiative

Beyond its manufacturing investments, Toyota says that it is also actively preparing the workforce of the future. The Toyota USA Foundation recently launched Driving Possibilities, a $110 million initiative to support pre-K through K-12 education and beyond. The long-term program aims to close educational gaps through innovative, hands-on STEM learning while addressing the essential needs of students and families.",https://theshopmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tech-looking-at-camera-in-Toyota-hyprid-production-plant.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 21:59:19.026651

But his enthusiasm for a “closed-loop” small modular reactor (or SMR) complex requires a more careful look (“George Gemelas: Indiana just leveled up as leader in nuclear power,” Forefront, Nov. 14). Indiana is being invited to take on risks for an industry whose promises are unproven.

First, the editorial highlights Fanco’s plan to reprocess spent nuclear fuel on-site. This is unprecedented in the USA. The closest analogue is a West Valley, New York, facility that reprocessed commercial spent fuel and operated for only six years. The site has been in cleanup for nearly half a century and remains one of the most complex nuclear remediation projects in the country. Indiana officials should visit West Valley before assuming reprocessing is straightforward or low impact.

Second, Gemelas endorses a strategy of burning more natural gas while hoping new reactors arrive in the 2030s. Natural gas emits about a pound of CO2-equivalent for every 2 kWh generated, worsening the climate crisis now while gambling on technology that may or may not be ready later. If SMRs fall behind schedule or fail to perform, what is Indiana’s Plan B?

Third, even with reprocessing, long-lived high-level nuclear waste remains. The United States has no deep geological repository, and none will be available for decades. That means any high-level waste created here will stay in Indiana indefinitely. Moreover, for the economics of reprocessing to pencil out, Indiana would likely need to import spent fuel from other states. Will this be acceptable to the host community and the state?

Fourth, the plan for six SMRs (enough to power 1.5 million homes) creates a significant resilience challenge. Concentrating so much generation in one location introduces a major point of failure. If the plant goes off-line, half the state could lose power.

Finally, large energy “parks” inevitably attract large consumers such as data centers, increasing demand and potentially requiring yet more power plants. If Indiana needs power, consider weatherization and solar first. If it really wants nuclear, why not consider proven, commercial-scale designs rather than experimental ones?

Indiana deserves a full, transparent evaluation of the benefits, risks and alternatives, not just optimistic projections.",https://www.ibj.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/og-logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:39.484697
,EPA,2025-11-21 22:54:53+00:00,"Bergeson & Campbell, P.C.",TSCA PFAS Reporting: Implications of EPA's New Statutory Interpretation on Articles,Lynn L. Bergeson,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/tsca-pfas-reporting-implications-of-epas-new-statutory-interpretation-on-articles/,"At a minimum, EPA’s posture here suggests a particularly firm resolve in this Administration to keep articles importers out of the final PFAS reporting rule.
Beyond PFAS, there are also some potentially broader implications regarding EPA’s new statements on its authority over articles importers.
Stakeholders supporting EPA’s authority over articles importers made a number of arguments in public comments on the 2021 proposed PFAS reporting rule.
Time will tell whether EPA “sticks” with the interpretation it has taken in the proposed PFAS reporting rule and how closely EPA will hew to the statutory language in other sections.
In any case, the rationale EPA has offered on the PFAS reporting rule certainly opens the door to a closer read of TSCA statutory authorities over articles.","Headlines regarding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) most recent proposed update to the one-time per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule under Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) have been dominated by the rule’s new exemptions and the significant narrowing of responsibility and burden that industry stakeholders will face if the rule becomes final. But, buried in the preambular text — Unit III.A.2 to be precise — are a few paragraphs that caught our attention: a proposed interpretation that EPA lacks statutory authority to require reporting by those who import PFAS in articles.

EPA now states that the law is “best read as excluding articles and targeting the reporting requirement to manufacturers of the PFAS themselves.” EPA rationalizes that Congress “could have said so” if it desired the reporting requirements to extend to those who import articles containing PFAS. In EPA’s words: “[w]here Congress omits expansive modifiers, they should not be inferred.” It is worth mentioning that the argument itself is not new; EPA received some public comment to this effect on the original 2021 proposed rule. In the 2023 final rule and response to comments document, EPA disagreed and defended its authority, citing the decades-long interpretation that “manufacture of a chemical substance” under TSCA includes import of an article containing the chemical substance.

More than five years of regulatory development activity have transpired since Congress enacted the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that added TSCA Section 8(a)(7) and directed EPA to undertake rulemaking to collect more information on PFAS. EPA’s estimated burdens with respect to articles importers in the 2021 proposed rule drew significant criticism, prompting EPA to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) panel in 2022, update its economic analysis to inform the 2023 final rule, and develop numerous guidance materials to assist articles importers with compliance responsibilities. Stakeholders were correct to note that EPA has excluded articles from various other regulatory contexts, including chemical data reporting (CDR) under TSCA Section 8(a) and premanufacture notice review of new chemicals. When EPA Administrator Zeldin announced in 2025 that EPA would implement the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements “smartly” and “without overburdening small businesses and article importers,” many in the TSCA community expected some regulatory relief. The proposed rule, however, takes it even one step further.

As indicated in Bergeson & Campbell, P.C.’s recent analysis of the proposed rule, we found EPA’s new position — that it previously exceeded its own statutory authority in requiring articles importers to report under TSCA — to be quite notable. And while EPA requested feedback on the argument, it also concurrently proposed to exempt articles importers, citing TSCA Section 8(a)(5) and arguing that such entities are less likely to have responsive information, effectively doubling down on its effort to exclude articles importers from scope. We remind readers that in the 2023 final rule, EPA estimated that only 10 percent of small articles importers would have information to report on PFAS in imported articles; the remaining 90 percent would undergo due diligence and compliance burdens only to determine they lack responsive information. Whether the data that might be reported justify the (likely futile) effort of the 90 percent is a legitimate area of disagreement and one that this Administration has decided is not worth the burden on small businesses.

At a minimum, EPA’s posture here suggests a particularly firm resolve in this Administration to keep articles importers out of the final PFAS reporting rule. Future would-be challengers to this rule will have to convince a court both that (1) EPA has statutory authority to require reporting from articles importers, and (2) EPA’s application of discretion under TSCA Section 8(a)(5) to exempt articles importers was inappropriate. Considering this, we would not expect EPA to collect information on how PFAS might be entering the United States through imported articles any time soon. Similarly, given the data-driven nature of rulemaking, any future regulatory efforts on PFAS under TSCA are not likely to focus on exposures from imported articles either.

Beyond PFAS, there are also some potentially broader implications regarding EPA’s new statements on its authority over articles importers. Although the discussion in the proposed rule is framed narrowly (i.e., only in the context of the specific language in TSCA Section 8(a)(7)), the underlying rationale used by EPA could be applied to other instances in TSCA that refer to “manufacture of a chemical substance” without a corresponding reference to “articles.” Applying EPA’s new reasoning, for example, one could argue that Congress never intended EPA’s existing chemical risk evaluations to consider import of articles containing a chemical as a “condition of use.” Congress could have mentioned “articles” — but did not — when it defined “conditions of use” in the 2016 amendments to govern the scope of existing chemical reviews. Congress also did not include expansive modifiers like “contain” or “including imported articles” when it charged EPA to regulate “manufacture…of a chemical substance” that presents an unreasonable risk under TSCA Section 6(a). Although there are specific mentions of “article” in TSCA Section 3 definitions of “process” and “distribute in commerce,” and in specific other aspects of TSCA Sections 5 and 6, the word “article” does not appear in TSCA’s definition of “manufacture” — the statutory term encompassing import of chemical substances into the United States.

Of course, such a position would not be without controversy. Stakeholders supporting EPA’s authority over articles importers made a number of arguments in public comments on the 2021 proposed PFAS reporting rule. For example, the statutory definition of “chemical substance” in Section 3 does not generally exclude articles, and the specific exclusion for some articles in that definition (e.g., firearms) could imply that Congress contemplated the term “chemical substance” otherwise to be inclusive of chemicals contained in articles. Likewise, other provisions in the law, e.g., TSCA Sections 5(a)(5) and 6(a)(3), give EPA explicit authority to protect against risk and require warnings (respectively) for chemicals in articles. TSCA Section 6(c) includes some specific limitations on regulation of chemicals in articles (e.g., replacement parts), which arguably would not be necessary if Congress did not intend to convey statutory authority to address chemicals in articles in different ways in different sections of the statute.

Time will tell whether EPA “sticks” with the interpretation it has taken in the proposed PFAS reporting rule and how closely EPA will hew to the statutory language in other sections. In any case, the rationale EPA has offered on the PFAS reporting rule certainly opens the door to a closer read of TSCA statutory authorities over articles. Any changes in EPA’s statutory interpretations are worth keeping an eye on and could have profound implications regarding the scope and reach of future TSCA actions.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature_EPA_building.png,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:20.551301

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. “Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

But North Carolina’s journalism scene does have success stories, including two locally owned media companies that are seeing growth.

David Woronoff owns The Pilot, a thriving newspaper in Southern Pines, and magazines including Business North Carolina and Walter. Kyle Villemain started The Assembly in 2021, and it’s since grown to a staff of 43 people producing in-depth stories on all things North Carolina.

Both companies are adding to the state’s political news coverage (each has a politics newsletter for paid subscribers), and they’re expanding into underserved areas of the state.

Woronoff recently launched a new magazine called EastBound, covering communities east of Interstate 95, and Villemain has added a newsroom in Greensboro and a newsletter covering Cary and western Wake County.

Both joined this week's episode of the WUNC Politics Podcast to discuss their publications and the state of the news media in North Carolina.

This conversation has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

What's allowed you to grow instead of shrink?

Woronoff: ""So many of the problems that our industry faces are self-imposed, and you could lay it at the feet of private equity ownership of news organizations, where the ownership is disengaged from the local community. Ours is locally and independently owned, and I believe that is the key to our success.""

Villemain: ""I also think that people respond when you put a really good product out there, when you put good reporting out there, whether it just really speaks to what they see in their community, if it speaks to what they see in their business, if it makes them feel more informed and more curious about the state — and it's just really good. People have a good eye for quality, and I think the news business has oftentimes not put out as high quality of a product as they think they are, and people respond by not engaging.""

I've been tracking the increase in news deserts and some of the more rural pockets of the state. I'm curious to what extent your organizations' models may be able to be replicated in other places.

Woronoff: ""As much as I'd like to say, 'oh yes, you could just pick ours up and drop it in Roanoke Rapids, or Laurinburg or Rockingham,' it's not that simple.

The company’s $1.1 billion, fully vertically integrated facility spans 2.4 million square feet, or about 11 times the size of the stadium’s main arena.

The factory began production quietly in July, a few months ahead of schedule, and employs more than 700 people. First Solar expects that number to hit 826 by the end of the year. Once it’s fully online, the site will add 3.5 GW of annual manufacturing capacity. That brings the company’s total US footprint to 14 GW in 2026 and 17.7 GW in 2027, when its newly announced South Carolina plant is anticipated to come online.

The Louisiana plant produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using US-made materials — glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel from Mississippi, which is fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

The new factory leans heavily on AI, from computer vision that spots defects on the line to deep learning tools that help technicians make real‑time adjustments.

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry says the investment is already a win for the region, bringing in “hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses.” A new economic impact analysis from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette projects that the factory will boost Iberia Parish’s GDP by 4.4% in its first full year at capacity. The average manufacturing compensation package comes in at around $90,000, more than triple the parish’s per capita income.

First Solar CEO Mark Widmar framed the new facility as a major step for US clean energy manufacturing: “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

This site joins what’s already the largest solar manufacturing and R&D footprint in the Western Hemisphere: three factories in Ohio, one in Alabama, and R&D centers in Ohio and California. Just last week, First Solar announced a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore more Series 6 module work. By the end of 2026, the company expects to directly employ more than 5,500 people across the US.

Still, the Constitution says very little about the individual rights of Members of Congress and nothing about individual Member oversight.
Truman Committee Members and staff visited and inspected U.S. Army housing camps, military manufacturing facilities, and allied military bases abroad.
Individual Member Oversight Powers In contrast, Members, acting on their own, have not been delegated the same investigatory powers and tools as committees.
Statutory Sources of Member Oversight Functions While limited, some statutory provisions support the oversight activities of individual members.","Several disputes have arisen in the 119th Congress surrounding access by Members of Congress to federal buildings. On several occasions, Members have been denied entry to various agency offices, and at least one Member was forcibly removed from an agency press conference in a federal building. A group of Members sued Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after they were refused access to immigration facilities, and, in a separate incident, one Member has been indicted for an altercation with law enforcement that occurred while attempting to inspect an ICE facility.

These controversies—which, though not novel, appear to be occurring with more frequency—seem to stem not only from differing interpretations of federal law by the executive and legislative branches but also from an interbranch disagreement over a Member's role in overseeing executive activities. The executive branch has at times asserted that agencies retain authority to control access to their buildings and that individual Members of Congress generally ""do not have the authority to conduct oversight"" except through an authorized committee investigation. Some Members, on the other hand, have argued for a legal right to access federal property that stems from federal statute and their individualized constitutional authority both to inform themselves on legislative matters and conduct oversight of the executive's implementation of federal law.

This Sidebar addresses this disagreement by discussing legal principles that govern the exercise of oversight by individual Members. Members of both chambers and both parties have long engaged in their own efforts to inform themselves of agency activity and confirm that a given executive agency is implementing the law in a way that comports with that Member's view of the statutory powers that Congress has entrusted to that agency. The courts have also recognized, in various contexts, that investigating and overseeing the executive branch is part of the official responsibilities of a Member of Congress.

Still, the Constitution says very little about the individual rights of Members of Congress and nothing about individual Member oversight. There are few federal laws or chamber rules that directly and explicitly empower Members to act unilaterally to obtain information from the executive branch and perhaps one lawthat explicitly governs Member access to federal facilities for oversight purposes. (In that case, the provision applies only to certain Department of Homeland Security immigration centers.) Instead, House and Senate rules and federal statutes that delegateformal investigatory and oversight authority generally do so to committees and committee chairs. While either chamber could vest each of its Members with compulsory investigative tools—for example, by providing all Members with the power to issue subpoenas or establishing a broad-based right of access to federal property—neither the House nor the Senate has explicitly done so. As a result, although individual Members possess an implicit constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch and inform themselves of matters of legislative importance, they do not appear to have easy access to the tools that may allow them to overcome an agency's resistance to their information-gathering efforts.

Congressional Oversight Powers and Limits

As analyzed in greater detail in other CRS products, both the House and Senate have an implied constitutional power to investigate matters relating to their legislative functions—a power that includes conducting oversight of the executive branch. The Supreme Court has described this power as ""broad"" and one that ""encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes."" To effectively perform its legislative responsibilities, the Court has recognizedthat Congress must know whether an agency's functions are ""being properly discharged or . . . neglected or misdirected, and particularly whether [agency officials are] performing or neglecting their duties.""

Each chamber has delegatedthis constitutional ""power of inquiry,"" including the tools necessary to gather information, to its standing committees through House or Senate rules. Under these rules, committees may conduct investigations, hold hearings, call witnesses, take depositions, and issue and enforce subpoenas, and under federal statute, committees are to use their powers and tools to ""review and study, on a continuing basis,"" the implementation of law by federal agencies.

Congress is not a law enforcement agency, and it therefore generally does not conduct the type of physical search that, by comparison, is typical of an executive branch criminal investigation. Still, Congress gathers information necessary to inform and support its various legislative functions in many ways. For example, though not explicitly referenced in House or Senate rules, site visits and inspections of federal property have long been one tool in Congress's oversight toolbox. This practice likely derives from a combination of Congress's implicit oversight powers and its explicit constitutional authority to ""make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting . . . Property belonging to the United States."" As described in a recent filingby a group of Members denied access to ICE facilities, examples of ""on the ground oversight"" can be traced back to investigations by the Continental Congress and were a prominent part of the investigation into wartime waste during World War II conducted by the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (Truman Committee). Truman Committee Members and staff visited and inspected U.S. Army housing camps, military manufacturing facilities, and allied military bases abroad. Members undertook similar investigative activities during the Civil War, when Members of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Civil War inspected ""Camp Convalescent"" in Alexandria, VA, following allegations of unacceptable conditions at that military hospital. In-person site visits, of both government and private property, remain a regular feature of modern congressional investigations.

In addition to this practice, courts have also recognized field investigations and inspections as a component of congressional fact-finding. In McSurely v McClellan, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) announced that it had ""no doubt that information gathering,"" by either ""field work"" or ""field investigations"" by a committee Member or his staff, ""is essential to informed deliberation over proposed legislation"" and that ""the acquisition of knowledge through informal sources is a necessary concomitant of legislative conduct.""

The House and Senate have not, however, provided their committees with limitless investigative power. Committees may only use compulsory tools that have been given to them by their parent chamber, and then only when investigating matters within the committee's delegated jurisdiction—or, put another way, they are ""restricted to the missions delegated to them."" In practice, Congress's constitutional powers of investigation and oversight are typically carried out by committees under the powers and restraints provided by House and Senate rules.

Individual Member Oversight Powers

In contrast, Members, acting on their own, have not been delegated the same investigatory powers and tools as committees. An individual Member (other than a committee chair if delegated that authority by the parent chamber or by the rules of their committee) may not unilaterally convene an official committee hearing, initiate an official committee investigation, issue a subpoena, or seek enforcement of a subpoena through contempt.

Nevertheless, these specific and formal powers represent a small portion of what may be considered congressional ""oversight."" Every Member of Congress has the ability, as ""an officer of the union, deriving his powers and qualifications from the Constitution,"" to leverage their position to influence agency action or gather information necessary to do their job. Also, though the Constitution does not vest the legislative power ""in any one individual,"" the ""action of the body as a whole"" requires the consent of ""the aggregate of the members who compose the body."" As explainedby the D.C. Circuit, ""[a]ll Members have a constitutionally recognized status entitling them to share in general congressional powers and responsibilities, many of them requiring access to executive information."" Each individual Member therefore participates in the exercise of Congress's legislative and investigative powers. It would appear that the same can be said for the exercise of committee power: though investigative jurisdiction and authorities have been delegated to committees, each Member of the committee shares in that power, and ""each is entitled to request such information from the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out the responsibilities of a legislator.""

Statutory Sources of Member Oversight Functions

While limited, some statutory provisions support the oversight activities of individual members. For example, some provisions of federal law require agencies to disclose specific types of information ""upon request of any Member of Congress."" Another law, 5 U.S.C. § 2954, requires agencies to comply with requests for information made by seven Members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform or five members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Various agency regulations similarly recognize an individual Member's right of access to certain types of information, and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, though noting that individual Members have generally not been delegated investigative powers, nevertheless has reasoned that Members' requests should be given ""due weight and sympathetic consideration"" out of ""respect for the legislative functions of individual members.""

Relevant to many of the ongoing disputes, Congress has also used its power of the purse to support Member oversight activities. Since 2019, Congress has repeatedly enacted an appropriations provision that affirms the right of Members to physically inspect certain immigration facilities for oversight purposes. The initial law prohibited the use of appropriated funds to ""prevent a Member of Congress from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house alien minors."" Congress later expandedthat law to prohibit the use of funds to deny Members access to ""any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens."" The current appropriations restriction also explicitly provides that ""[n]othing in this section may be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice"" of their intent to enter such a facility, though DHS may require that congressional staff provide the agency with 24 hours' notice.

Enforcement of Oversight Requests

Ultimately, the primary distinction between the exercise of investigative powers by the House or Senate (through its committees) and individual Members is that committees have the power and tools (albeit with limitations) to overcome resistance to their oversight efforts and enforce their demands for information. Committees can compel compliance with their requests by issuing subpoenas and enforcing those subpoenas (with the approval of the parent chamber) either in court or through criminal contempt of Congress referrals. Members, on the other hand, generally cannot utilize these mechanisms. Even when acting pursuant to statutory powers, Members have often struggled to enforce their rights. While Members may request information from an agency and exert various forms of pressure to increase the likelihood of compliance with their requests, they generally have not been able to legally compel an agency, in court or otherwise, to disclose information that the agency is otherwise reluctant to produce. As described by the D.C. Circuit: ""disclosure of information can only be compelled by authority of Congress, its committees or subcommittees, not solely by individual members . . . . Election to the Congress does not give an individual subpoena power over whatever information he may happen to be interested in.""

Whether the difficulties that Members have experienced in enforcing other oversight rights may also be apparent in field investigations may be answered by the pending litigation brought by individual Members of Congress who were denied access to ICE facilities. That case includes the added complexity that it is at least partly founded on the appropriations provision discussed above, which is phrased as a prohibition on the use of funds rather than an explicit grant of authority to individual Members. One federal district court has stated that, as a result of the provision, Members are ""statutorily authorized to enter and inspect"" covered facilities ""to conduct oversight.""

Even with its greater authority, a committee acting pursuant to an authorized investigation may still have some difficulty enforcing a request for access to government property because the typical enforcement tools may not be available in that context. The subpoena is a committee's traditional means of compulsion, but subpoenas generally only come in two forms: subpoenas ad testificandum, or demands for testimony, and subpoenas duces tecum, or demands for records or other evidence. While congressional committees have attempted to use subpoenas in a variety of ways—for example, to prevent the removal of life support or to compel a witness to sign a document that would provide the Congress with access to an overseas bank account—it is not clear how a subpoena could be used to gain physical access to a site. Securing such access, therefore, may require the use of other forms of legislative leverage or litigating any constitutional power or statutory right in court.

Informal Member Fact-Finding and the Speech or Debate Clause

While it is generally recognized that conducting oversight of executive branch activities is one of the official responsibilities of a Member of Congress as described above, judicial decisions interpreting the legal protections that the Speech or Debate Clause (Clause) affords Members in exercising that oversight responsibility have injected some confusion into this area of law.

The Clause largely immunizes Members from criminal and civil liability predicated on their ""legislative acts."" The types of actions that the Clause protects go well beyond formal ""Speech or Debate"" in the halls of Congress to include any action that is an ""integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes"" through which Congress implements ""matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.""

The Supreme Court has held that investigative and oversight actions sanctioned by either the House or Senate or a congressional committee are the type of activities that receive the protections of the Clause. As a result, courts have interpreted actions taken by individual Members in the course of an authorized congressional investigation (for example at hearings, in issuing subpoenas, or pursuing contempt) as protected ""legislative acts.""

Some courts have been less receptive to interpreting the Clause to protect informal investigative and oversight actions undertaken by individual Members outside of authorized committee investigations. While these interactions are generally viewed as ""official"" and ""legitimate,"" they have not always been viewed as ""legislative"" for purposes of the Clause. The Supreme Court has saidthat efforts to influence how the executive branch implements or administers the laws enacted by Congress (a common and legitimate oversight activity) are not ""integral"" to the legislative function and not protected by the Clause, at least when conducted ""informally"" by an individual Member. As stated by the Supreme Court: ""Members of Congress are constantly in touch with the Executive Branch of the Government and with administrative agencies—they may cajole, and exhort with respect to the administration of a federal statute—but such conduct, though generally done, is not protected legislative activity.""

There is also some disagreement among the courts as to whether a Member's efforts to gather information from an agency necessary to assist in their legislative duties (as opposed to seeking to influence agency conduct) is protected legislative activity. Some courts do not view informal actions by individual Members as ""integral to the legislative process"" for purposes of the Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, for example, has held that ""informal information gathering—either personally by a member of Congress or by congressional aides""—is not protected legislative activity. That court, however, acknowledged that information gathering ""is a proper congressional function and, when conducted by a committee, should be treated just as voting and debating legislation.""

That said, most courts have held that this type of informal fact-finding is a protected legislative act, regardless of whether that fact-finding is undertaken as part of an authorized committee investigation. The D.C. Circuit, for example, has articulatedthat ""the acquisition of knowledge through informal sources is a necessary concomitant of legislative conduct and thus should be within the ambit of [the Clause's] privilege so that congressmen are able to discharge their constitutional duties properly."" In another case, United States v. Biaggi, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that ""legislative factfinding activity conducted"" by an individual Member during a trip ""to inspect and visit"" state agencies in Florida in preparation for a congressional hearing was protected legislative activity. This recognition of the importance of legislative fact-finding by individual Members is consistent with the position generally taken by Members that, as constitutionally elected officers of the legislative branch, they may engage in oversight and investigations and are entitled to access necessary information.

Similarly, in McSurely, the D.C. Circuit recognized Member and staff ""field work"" and ""field investigations"" as protected legislative activities. At the same time, the court also clarifiedthat ""a Member of Congress or congressional employee is not free to use every conceivable means to obtain investigatory materials without fear of criminal prosecution or civil suit."" In that case, a Senate committee staff member traveled to Kentucky to view, collect, and transport back to Washington, DC, information that allegedly had been unlawfully obtained from an individual by state authorities and was subject to a court order of confidentiality due to Fourth Amendment concerns. Though acknowledging the committee staffer was engaged in informal fact-finding, the court nevertheless held that ""the employment of unlawful means to implement an otherwise proper legislative objective is simply not 'essential to legislating'"" and therefore was not protected by the Clause.

Most recently, in a federal criminal prosecution of a sitting Member of Congress, the Department of Justice acknowledged, and the federal district court agreed, that the Member's oversight and fact-finding inspection of a federal immigration facility was a protected legislative act. In that case, however, the court found that a physical altercation with law enforcement that took place ""during a brief time frame before the oversight inspection began"" was ultimately not a protected legislative act. That case remains ongoing.

While these cases are useful in understanding the scope of legislative power, especially absent cases dealing directly with individual Member oversight, the Clause acts primarily as a shield against intrusion by other branches into legislative acts: it is a protection; not a source of authority. For this reason, Speech or Debate Clause principles have played a significant role in recent executive branch efforts to either investigate or prosecute conduct that Members have described as information gathering—including the government's attempt, as referenced above, to prosecute a Member for an altercation with law enforcement that occurred during an oversight visit to an ICE facility.

Whether informal fact-finding activity is entitled to Speech or Debate Clause protections does not dispositively determine whether such activity is within a Member's authority. The fact that a certain activity may not qualify as legislative for purposes of the Clause does not necessarily mean that activity is unauthorized. The Court has made clear that some unprotected acts, though not deemed legislative, may still be within a Member's official responsibilities. The reverse is also true: the fact that a certain activity is considered legislative does not mean that it is authorized. Unauthorized acts—even some criminal acts—can still be protected legislative acts under the Clause.

Conclusion

Oversight of the executive branch is an essential aspect of the legislative function. While Congress has provided many of the compulsory investigative tools that support its oversight efforts to committees, individual Members nevertheless appear to retain the ability to conduct their own investigations and gather their own information, including through field investigations and site visits. Still, there are significant distinctions between committee investigations and individual Member investigations. Members have limited means available to enforce their particular investigative requests and, under the Speech or Debate Clause, may not always receive immunity for their otherwise legitimate investigative actions.",https://www.congress.gov/img/opengraph1200by630.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:59:06.787443

It helped spark the modern environmental movement and led to longstanding restrictions on offshore drilling along California’s coast.
“The threat posed by offshore drilling is not just environmental.
Offshore oil and gas leasing poses serious health and safety risks to our communities.","Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (CA-26) released the following statement after the Trump administration announced plans to allow new oil and gas drilling off the California Coast for the first time in decades.

“The Trump administration has made its priorities unmistakably clear: rolling back protections, dismantling safeguards, and putting the interests of wealthy donors and powerful corporations before the health, safety, and future of the American people. That includes dragging our nation back to a time when rivers caught fire, smog choked our cities, and California’s iconic coastline was wide open to offshore oil and gas drilling, and we know all too well what that means.

“Oil spills have caused some of the worst environmental catastrophes in our nation’s history. While the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill occurred just north of California’s 26th Congressional District, its devastation is part of our region’s collective memory. That disaster was so profound that it transformed how our government oversees environmental protection for the offshore energy industry. It helped spark the modern environmental movement and led to longstanding restrictions on offshore drilling along California’s coast.

“The threat posed by offshore drilling is not just environmental. Offshore oil and gas leasing poses serious health and safety risks to our communities. It endangers local economies that rely on clean water and healthy ecosystems, including tourism, fishing, outdoor recreation, and the jobs that come with them. It also threatens the backbone of Ventura County’s $2 billion agricultural economy. Our farmers and farmworkers depend on clean water, healthy soil, and stable ecosystems to grow the crops that feed our country.

“An offshore spill could contaminate irrigation sources, damage coastal farmland, and jeopardize thousands of jobs across California’s Central Coast, and these harms are not borne equally. Low-income communities, communities of color, and the workers who power our agricultural and coastal economies, like Oxnard, the largest city in my district and one of the larger coastal cities in California, suffer first and worst from pollution, toxic exposure, and environmental degradation.

“Environmental justice demands that we prevent new harms — not repeat the failures of the past. At a time when the U.S. is already the world’s leading producer of oil and gas, when major oil companies are raking in record profits, and when most federal acres leased to industry sit unused, there is no justification for putting California’s coast back on the chopping block — except to serve corporate interests.

“Let me be absolutely clear: my Democratic colleagues and I stand united. We are committed to confronting this administration’s assault on our environment and standing up to the corporate interests trying to write our nation’s energy policy.

“We will fight back, not quietly, not halfway, but with the full force of our values and our conviction, because our coast, our communities, and our climate are worth every ounce of that fight.”

“When I first heard that the payment in lieu of taxes was going to be $360 million, I assumed that was annually,” Lara Cadena, who also serves as vice chair on the House Taxation and Revenue Committee, said. “To see that our county commission signed a deal to receive so little, I was just stunned.”

Critics take issue with the data center’s energy source, in particular. Plans call for a natural gas generating “microgrid,” a system that can solely rely on its own power rather than drawing from an existing grid. Project representatives have touted that as a way to prevent the data center from increasing nearby residents’ energy bills. But critics say the 2025 law that governs microgrids appears to exempt them from complying with the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act — which requires that utilities use 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 80% renewable energy by 2040 — until 2045, when it would be required to use fully renewable energy.

Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the legislative language in question, has previously disputed that characterization to Source New Mexico and insisted that the development must comply with every aspect of the clean energy law.

“It was a process failure, it was a transparency failure, it was a democracy failure,” Rubio said. “The community was sidelined.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter1-2048x1365.png,N,,2025-11-21 19:58:47.051468

So when you think about what regulation might make data center development more reasonable, it’s asking for the costs happening to be borne by the industry making them.
Fairfax County passed a data center zoning ordinance amendment – minimum requirements a data center will have to adhere to.","Tell me more about how you started focusing on data centers.

So, in Fairfax County, in 2020 or 2021, people were pursuing the construction of an indoor ski facility on a landfill. From a climate perspective, to build something that would need to be cooled 24/7 for indoor skiing seemed like a very bad proposal in terms of energy usage. And for what kind of gain?

Then our friends at the Sierra Club were saying, indoor ski slopes? Bad, yes. But data centers? Way, way worse. Those aren’t cooling to support snow but are cooling much larger areas on a much larger scale, dwarfing the area of that one ski slope. This was around the time the Prince William Digital Gateway was showing up – they were saying all these acres of agricultural lands and single-family housing zones were about to be rezoned. This was a big deal, and Sierra Club led the way in opening our eyes to this. The rezoning ultimately passed. The data centers were sued and the people who filed the lawsuit won, but pre-planning for the centers is still allowed to take place.

The way we think about the impacts of data centers, besides the loss of natural lands and the amount of energy that’s going to be needed to power these things, has been diesel generators. These are the things that are backup generation and the camel’s nose under the tent is trying to get them to be primary power.

Now I want to ask you a provocative question: is there any middle ground between letting these projects be built unfettered and outright bans on their development?

We have no regulation today. From our standpoint, these things are coming, they’re here. We know a lot more now than we did in 2022. As we make decisions about how and where to build these facilities we all need – I mean we’re using one right now. I use a data center all day at work. Teams conferencing. ChatGPT to answer a question. We need these. So if we’re going to build them, let’s not give a pass to some of the world’s largest and richest companies. Let’s ask them to put the guardrails on to protect our residences and our infrastructure to make sure they’re as sustainable as possible.

Okay, so what are the guardrails then?

The costs of what was going to go into a data center need to be more transparent. We need to bring accountability to the forefront right away as they’re being built.

In Ohio, they passed a law requiring data center companies to pay for a high percentage of the power they’re using. That cut a significant number of the projects in Ohio. This industry is so speculative and a land grab and a rush to be first to get the most.

You have this dichotomy of land values for residences being inundated, while land values for developers are skyrocketing. We have an affordability crisis going on and we are all on the hook for paying for the infrastructure to power these things.

So when you think about what regulation might make data center development more reasonable, it’s asking for the costs happening to be borne by the industry making them. Let’s get rid of some of the incentives for power users. We don’t need to be encouraging the loss of state revenue, either – we’re leaving money on the table to bring these facilities here.

Lastly, our readers love to get hyperlocal. I know you’re intently focused on Fairfax County right now which has been a big part of the data center boom in Virginia – what’s happening there?

There are a couple things that have happened over the course of this past year. Fairfax County passed a data center zoning ordinance amendment – minimum requirements a data center will have to adhere to. The big thing with that one is, you have to have a special exception if you build within a mile of a Metro station. When you think about good land use and building a data center within a walkable distance of a Metro, that’s eye-openingly poor land use policy and a missed opportunity for transit-oriented development. It doesn’t mean they can’t be built near one but you have to get a special exception.

Some things can’t be regulated at the local level. Like generators. That’s in the hands of the state.

Last night, we had a public hearing at the Fairfax County board level for our policy plan – our comprehensive plan providing guidance for developers who want to get a special exception or rezoning. It is not law. It is not required. It is a visionary document that helps us get to better. They’ve added a section for data centers in that. In May, staff put forward something pretty good, making sure data centers met a minimum level of efficiency. But our chairman of the county board said it went above and beyond our zoning ordinance and said he didn’t think it was appropriate, so staff rewrote that section and stripped out a lot of the specificity and higher standards that were in that document.

At the hearing, they deferred a decision, listening to the public but not having a discussion at the board level. They’ve left the record open through December 9th.

As we chronicle time and time again in The Fight, residents in farming communities are fighting back aggressively – protesting, petitioning, suing and yelling loudly. Things have gotten so tense that some are refusing to let representatives for Piedmont’s developer, PSEG, onto their properties, and a court battle is currently underway over giving the company federal marshal protection amid threats from landowners.

Exacerbating the situation is a quirk we don’t often deal with in The Fight. Unlike energy generation projects, which are usually subject to local review, transmission sits entirely under the purview of Maryland’s Public Service Commission, a five-member board consisting entirely of Democrats appointed by current Governor Wes Moore – a rumored candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. It’s going to be months before the PSC formally considers the Piedmont project, and it likely won’t issue a decision until 2027 – a date convenient for Moore, as it’s right after he’s up for re-election. Moore last month expressed “concerns” about the project’s development process, but has brushed aside calls to take a personal position on whether it should ultimately be built.

Enter a potential Trump card that could force Moore’s hand. In early October, commissioners and state legislators representing Carroll County – one of the farm-heavy counties in Piedmont’s path – sent Trump a letter requesting that he intervene in the case before the commission. The letter followed previous examples of Trump coming in to kill planned projects, including the Grain Belt Express transmission line and a Tennessee Valley Authority gas plant in Tennessee that was relocated after lobbying from a country rock musician.

One of the letter’s lead signatories was Kenneth Kiler, president of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners, who told me this lobbying effort will soon expand beyond Trump to the Agriculture and Energy Departments. He’s hoping regulators weigh in before PJM, the regional grid operator overseeing Mid-Atlantic states. “We’re hoping they go to PJM and say, ‘You’re supposed to be managing the grid, and if you were properly managing the grid you wouldn’t need to build a transmission line through a state you’re not giving power to.’”

Part of the reason why these efforts are expanding, though, is that it’s been more than a month since they sent their letter, and they’ve heard nothing but radio silence from the White House.

“My worry is that I think President Trump likes and sees the need for data centers. They take a lot of water and a lot of electric [power],” Kiler, a Republican, told me in an interview. “He’s conservative, he values property rights, but I’m not sure that he’s not wanting data centers so badly that he feels this request is justified.”

Kiler told me the plan to kill the transmission line centers hinges on delaying development long enough that interest rates, inflation and rising demand for electricity make it too painful and inconvenient to build it through his resentful community. It’s easy to believe the federal government flexing its muscle here would help with that, either by drawing out the decision-making or employing some other as yet unforeseen stall tactic. “That’s why we’re doing this second letter to the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy asking them for help. I think they may be more sympathetic than the president,” Kiler said.

At the moment, Kiler thinks the odds of Piedmont’s construction come down to a coin flip – 50-50. “They’re running straight through us for data centers. We want this project stopped, and we’ll fight as well as we can, but it just seems like ultimately they’re going to do it,” he confessed to me.

Thus is the predicament of the rural Marylander. On the one hand, Kiler’s situation represents a great opportunity for a GOP president to come in and stand with his base against a would-be presidential candidate. On the other, data center development and artificial intelligence represent one of the president’s few economic bright spots, and he has dedicated copious policy attention to expanding growth in this precise avenue of the tech sector. It’s hard to imagine something less “energy dominance” than killing a transmission line.

WASHINGTON – Today, in coordination with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is releasing its first quarterly public update detailing progress made towards implementing a permanent, 100% solution to the Tijuana River sewage crisis afflicting millions of Americans in Southern California. Today’s public update marks another milestone in implementing the historic Memorandum of Understanding EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Secretary of the Environment and National Resources of Mexico Alicia Bárcena Ibarra signed in Mexico City in July 2025.

“The Trump Administration committed to delivering an urgent and permanent 100% solution to the millions of people afflicted by this crisis, and it is critical that we are transparent with the public about ongoing projects as well as the status of upcoming projects. Our mission will not be accomplished until we reach the 100% solution,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “So far, we have successfully implemented this MOU well ahead of the projected timeline. We are committed to maintaining full transparency regarding both our current initiatives and the progress of future projects, ensuring the public stays informed about our ongoing efforts and planned developments. Safeguarding public health and environmental integrity stands as EPA's foremost responsibility, and every American deserves confidence in the safety of the air they inhale and the recreational areas they enjoy.”

“President Trump, EPA Administrator Zeldin, and the USIBWC are making real progress on a 100% solution to permanently eliminate American exposure to Mexican sewage from the Tijuana River,” said USIBWC Commissioner Chad McIntosh. “As we accelerate our infrastructure improvements at our San Diego plant, we will continue to monitor Mexico's progress to make sure they also urgently complete the work they agreed to do. This information will be shared with our stakeholders who support our commitment to finally solve the Tijuana River sewage crisis.”

Section 1(b) of the MOU requires the United States and Mexico to issue clear, coordinated, and at least quarterly updates to the public. This quarterly public update details the historic progress both nations have made towards fully and faithfully executing the MOU, including:

USIBWC completing a 10 million gallons per day (mgd) interim expansion of the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBIWTP);

Mexico initiating the construction of the First Phase of the Tijuana River Gates, a collection pipes project, with Mexican state and federal funds;

A U.S.-Mexico binational working group announcing timelines for key Minute 328 projects had been compressed by an additional 9 months;

USIBWC completing a nanobubble ozonation pilot project for the Tijuana River and starting to plan for an accelerated 50 mgd expansion of SBIWTP;

EPA and SEMARNAT developing strategies for operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and accounts; and

U.S. and Mexican Sections of the IBWC entering final negotiations for a new treaty “Minute.”

The MOU established a framework for permanent resolution through three critical priorities crucial to achieving a 100% solution to the transboundary pollution crisis:

Securing Mexico's Financial Commitments

Accelerating Project Timelines

Adding Other Necessary Projects that Factor in Future Population Growth in the Tijuana River Valley

Future projects and timelines include Mexico allocating the remaining Minute 328 funds as part of Mexico’s 2026-2027 budgets, including half (USD$46M) in 2026 and half (USD$47M) in 2027, to facilitate completion of the remaining Minute 328 projects by December 31, 2027, or sooner, in accordance with the following project priority schedule:

Construction in Calendar Year 2026:

Rehabilitation of the Insurgentes Collector;

Rehabilitation of PB Matadero and Laureles Pump Station 2;

Rehabilitation of Poniente Interceptor;

Rehabilitation of the Oriente Interceptor;

Rehabilitation of the Collector Carranza; and

Backup power supply for PB1.

Construction in Calendar Year 2027:

Upgrades to the Arturo Herrera and La Morita WWTPs;

International Collector Phase II;

Rehabilitation of the Antiguo Force Main

Lift station and force main from Sainz Canyon to Arturo Herrera; and

Enclose the open channel from PB1 to SAB WWTP.

December 31, 2027 is the deadline to complete all Minute 328 projects.

Administrator Zeldin made it clear when he signed this agreement that the only way to achieve this desired end goal is to have a plan that takes into account all three of these key pillars. Sacrificing one of them would mean the “100%” solution would not be reached.

Since signing this MOU in July, the Trump Administration has made historic progress on implementing the agreement. In August, EPA and IBWC announced the completion of a 10 mgd expansion of the SBIWTP, which will significantly reduce wastewater flowing into the Tijuana River and help eliminate foul smells that have long plagued San Diego area residents. This project was initially projected to take two years, but the Trump Administration completed it in 100 days. The U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is working closely with our local and Mexican partners as we enter the rainy season in the San Diego-Tijuana area. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant will continue to treat sewage from Tijuana at full capacity while we protect its infrastructure from excess sediment and trash that come with stormwater.

This public update provides further details on Mexico’s progress on meeting commitments the country agreed to in signing the MOU.

The next milestone will be the signing of a new “Minute” by the end of 2025. As the public update notes, the U.S. and Mexico sections of the IBWC are finalizing negotiations.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:43.285749

“The Michigan Public Service Commission has even cited the effectiveness of the RICE units working in conjunction with a renewable energy portfolio due to the short time it takes the plants to ramp up and generate energy, helping to quickly make up for any energy shortfall.

The latest: The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) has been the center of attention from both Republicans and Democrats, with questions arising about transparency in its process, its achievements, and the general public’s opposition to government investments in private companies.","The debate over future economic development in Lansing continues with far-reaching implications for business — a conversation lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer publicly said they expected to address before the end of the year, after passing the state budget.

The Detroit Regional Chamber continues to meet with and provide input to the leadership of both legislative chambers and the Governor’s office.

Where the issue stands: The leading economic development concept being discussed is a payroll tax credit. The House Republicans and Senate Democrats have each introduced their own versions. The basis of their proposals stem from the “Good Jobs for Michigan” package passed under then-Gov. Rick Snyder, but which has since expired.

As talks continue, the size and scope of both the House and Senate proposals remain in question and may not include a focus on large-scale projects like previous business incentives, such as the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund.

Why it matters: Global competition is ramping up with the onset of AI, digitalization, and automation, which are reshaping every industry. Site selectors analyze many factors when determining where to locate their next expansion, including the business climate, talent pool, and economic development incentives. With the expiration of SOAR at the end of 2025, Michigan needs to look at new forms of long-term, sustainable economic development incentives to compete for jobs and investment from other states and countries.

What it is: The Senate Democrats’ version of this payroll tax credit, called “More Jobs for Michigan” and introduced by Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), creates a withholding tax capture that diverts 100% of employee income taxes to the employer. Additionally, it offers a retention credit for jobs that were at risk of leaving if the employer had not made the investment in the state.

How it works: To qualify for the credit, the employer must be generating 25 or more jobs and must be at 175% of the Detroit Region’s median wage, or have 250 or more jobs at 150%. Currently, 175% of the Region’s wage is about $90,000, and 150% is about $77,000. This package selects jobs that it would qualify as “good jobs,” preferring white-collar jobs in engineering and semiconductors over blue-collar assembly line work.

What they’re saying: “The focus is on looking at high-paying e-jobs and what we can do to incentivize those,” Singh said. “My package also takes a look at how you retain jobs, and especially in this environment with the tariffs and so forth. Having a retention strategy for companies that are based here in Michigan makes a lot of sense to me.”

What it is: A payroll tax credit called “Real Jobs for Michigan,” introduced by Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), creates a new income tax capture program for companies that create new full-time jobs paying 150% of the regional median wage, which is about $77,000 in the Detroit Region, the highest in the state, and as low as $63,000 in the Northeast Region.

How it works: The program is capped at $50 million annually through 2036, with $10 million allocated for businesses with fewer than 100 employees, $15 million allocated for businesses with between 100 and 999 employees, and $25 million allocated for businesses with more than 1,000 employees.

What they’re saying: “The biggest benefit to this is it’s not corporate welfare,” Hoadley said. “It’s not upfront taxpayer money. It is sincerely performance incentives that go right to job creators in this state.”

What it is: The House Republicans’ legislation aims to refinance the state’s remaining $1.62 billion MEGA obligation by extending the payment schedule from five years to ten years. The House package repeals the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) and eliminates the MEGA tax credits, which were negotiated with previous Governors and the state’s largest employers to retain critical employment numbers in the state.

Why it matters: MEGA credits have been utilized during critical periods in Michigan’s economy, notably at the end of the 20th century and during the Great Recession, when companies were considering relocating out of Michigan or offshore. Those businesses that negotiated their MEGA credits made a commitment to the state that they would retain those jobs for Michiganders in exchange for the incentive.

What they’re saying: “We’re not walking away from the [MEGA] commitment,” Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills), the cosponsor of the legislation, said. “We’re simply going to restructure that and try to get that out in 10 payments over the next 10 years.”

What it is: Transformational brownfield plans are sales and use tax exemptions for developers of transformational projects on sites that would otherwise never have been redeveloped. The incentives are based on the project’s outcome and provide no upfront funding to developers.

Why it matters: Transformational brownfields have been around since 2017 and were essential in building Hudson’s Detroit. Without a level of incentive for redeveloping sites, vacant and polluted sites would remain undeveloped and leave urban cores with visible stains. The statewide cap was originally set at $800 million and then raised to $1.6 billion in 2023. The cap is $30 million away from being hit again, but multiple projects are being proposed, including the revitalization and partial demolition of the Renaissance Center property, which will easily exceed this.

What they’re saying: “This is a program that helped take our city from bankruptcy to a Top 50 place to visit in the world, and is enabling the same kind of transformation from west to east,” said Jared Fleisher, incoming Chief Executive Officer of Bedrock.

The latest: The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) has been the center of attention from both Republicans and Democrats, with questions arising about transparency in its process, its achievements, and the general public’s opposition to government investments in private companies. The House Republicans have introduced legislation to disband the MEDC, which Whitmer has promised to veto if it were ever to clear the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Clean energy exports from 2024 alone slashed global emissions by one per cent outside of China.
""The lucky few countries have got them [fossil fuels], but renewables, of course, are everywhere … everyone can do it,"" he said.
""Somehow, the reduction in enthusiasm of the global north is showing that the global south is moving.","There are well-known poster children for the transition to clean technologies. Norway, for its embrace of electric cars, Australia for rooftop solar and China for its colossal renewables industrial revolution.

But there are others that you might not have heard as much about.

Nepal, the landlocked Himalayan country, where 76 per cent of new cars are electric. Or Pakistan, where a homegrown solar boom has sprung up in response to rising energy prices.

Unshackled from established fossil-fuel industries and outdated technologies, these countries show how the global south is starting to move faster in the renewables transition than wealthier nations such as Australia. These shifts aren't being driven by climate motives, but rather energy security and economics.

In fact, the world is at a tipping point where renewable energy and electric cars are becoming so affordable that countries are leapfrogging the era of fossil fuels to go straight to green solutions, according to Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at global think tank Ember.

""The traditional way that people think about technology revolutions is they think that the rich countries do it first and then the technology makes it to the poor countries, which is what happened with the internet, for example,"" he says.

China as the centre of change

These developments would have been hard to fathom a decade ago.

China's rapid shift to renewables hasn't just transformed its own economy and started to eat into fossil fuel emissions at home; it's also building out that manufacturing capacity in other countries.

According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, since 2022 Chinese investments overseas have surged past $US220 billion ($340 billion) in manufacturing projects across batteries, solar, wind, electric cars and green hydrogen.

These investments are on top of the renewables and electric car products made in China and sold internationally.

Clean energy exports from 2024 alone slashed global emissions by one per cent outside of China.

While these exports are going to every region, the benefits are most striking in their immediate neighbourhood, according to Mr Bond.

""A lot of the electrification stories are China-adjacent. What you're seeing — as so often in technology revolutions — is countries near the centre of change are moving quicker. We have a real story of Asian electrification going on,"" he says.

The problem with fossil fuels is that not everyone has them, unlike sunshine and wind. Countries that don't have them are dependent on expensive, and sometimes volatile, imports.

Some 80 per cent of the world lives in countries that import coal, gas, petrol and diesel to power their lives, whereas 92 per cent of countries have the potential to generate renewable energy more than 10 times their current demand, Mr Bond says.

""The lucky few countries have got them [fossil fuels], but renewables, of course, are everywhere … everyone can do it,"" he said.

""People will harness their own energy. What's changed is that the price has come down so much that it's become feasible.""

The potential for cheap, abundant and locally-grown renewable energy, coupled with the opportunity to unshackle from imported fossil fuels, has seen emerging markets starting to transition faster than the global north.

Think of it like going straight to mobile phones instead of getting a landline connected first.

Wesley Morgan, a climate diplomacy academic at UNSW and fellow at the Climate Council, says this is a game-changer for global development and bringing access to electricity everywhere.

""Energy poverty is obviously still a thing in many parts of the developing world, but rather than going via … large fossil-fuel infrastructure like coal-fired power plants and then shifting to renewables, the economics now mean that developing countries can just leapfrog straight to renewables,"" he says.

Around the world, the clean energy transition is taking off in emerging markets.

Pakistan's sudden spike in solar in recent years, without any specific government policies or incentives driving it, has puzzled the world. The country has increased its solar capacity fivefold since 2022, and solar is now Pakistan's largest source of energy, ranking it among the top 20 countries globally for solar capacity.

In Africa, solar imports from China have risen by 60 per cent in the past year alone, according to analysis from Ember.

In Nepal, the dependence on imported oil via India was the catalyst for its EV boom.

In 2015, India implemented an unofficial oil blockade, grinding much of Nepal's transport to a halt and forcing the country to innovate, according to Reihana Mohideen, an electrical engineer at the University of Melbourne who focuses on the energy transition.

""Fuel tankers stopped arriving. Vital supplies were cut off. Prices skyrocketed. People queued for days at petrol stations. Black market rates soared. Public transport ground to a halt and long periods of blackout on top of existing blackout conditions,"" she said.

""So under those conditions, Nepal decided to explore a different course and look at electric vehicles. And the government played a really important role here [with] policy and planning.""

The Nepalese government introduced a target of having 90 per cent of new cars sold as electric by 2030 and this year it already reached 76 per cent.

By comparison, in Australia, battery-electric cars make up about 9 per cent of new car sales, rising to 12 per cent when hybrids are included.

Last year, the Ethiopian government's ban on combustion cars led to a spike in EV sales. The country spends more than $US4.5 billion importing fuel every year.

For small, island countries dotted across the Pacific, renewables reduce dependence on expensive diesel imports for power generators, according to Dr Mohideen.

""Solar plays a very important role because the systems can be smaller, they're modular, they're cheaper. Globally, the average prices for solar are cheaper than for fossil fuels,"" she says.

This is another key benefit of renewable systems, especially solar: developing regions can electrify without building large infrastructure. It doesn't even necessarily require government intervention or programs.

""This is a story we're kind of seeing now happening all over the place, people … import solar panels from China, you stick it on the back of a moped, and you carry it into the countryside, and you just put it up,"" Mr Bond says.

He says not having to adapt older energy systems — as is the case in Australia —makes it easier for emerging economies.

""If you're Kenya or Vietnam or Paraguay and your energy use per capita is relatively low, you don't have a huge entrenched fossil fuel system, and therefore you actually can build your electricity system right first time,"" Mr Bond says.

Another leap forward in this space has been the cost of batteries.

""Solar has been great, but you can't store it. And now you can store it cheaply with cheap batteries. This combination of solar plus batteries it's just creating a very different environment everywhere across the world,"" Mr Bond says.

""And the combination of the two is really what will break the logjam of change.""

India, not following the path of China, critical for the climate

For the emerging economies of the global south, the imperative to invest in renewables isn't to address climate change, as many of them have negligible emissions now. However, these regions would otherwise have the biggest emissions growth in the coming decades.

Their goal is to improve living standards, and the world's climate future will heavily depend on whether that can be done without the emissions toll that established economies such as the US or Australia have had.

""Now we have these big economies like China, like India, like Brazil, like Indonesia. And we really need those economies to be rapidly shifting to renewables if we're going to have any chance of tackling the climate crisis,"" Dr Morgan says.

Take India, for example, which has the world’s biggest population and is undergoing rapid economic development.

""If that is a fossil fuel-powered development, then we cannot come close to meeting our shared climate goals. So we really need India to be shifting to do what China is doing now, not what China has done over the last 30 years.""

There are already positive signs. India's per-capita emissions are lower than China's when it reached a similar level of GDP.

""India is not going down the Chinese path. If they were … Indian coal use per capita would already be two or three times higher than it is today,"" Mr Bond says.

""The reason … is not necessarily because of the global warming issues, simply because they've got another alternative — they've got the solar option.""

Where does this leave us today with COP?

As COP30 draws to a close, a lot of focus has been on the big emitters and the absence of the United States.

Corrêa do Lago, this year's COP president, stirred mixed reactions when he called out wealthy nations at the start of the summit.

""Somehow, the reduction in enthusiasm of the global north is showing that the global south is moving. It is not just this year — it has been moving for years, but it did not have the exposure that it has now,"" he told reporters in Belém.

Dr Morgan says there has always been tension between wealthy countries and the global south, with the expectation that developed countries needed to cut their emissions first.

""Essentially, the idea is that rich countries are supposed to move first, cutting their emissions and even more that they're supposed to provide finance to developing countries to help them with their energy transition and later coping with the impacts and adapting to climate change,"" he says.

""What [they] want to see is polluting nations paying for the loss and damage caused by their pollution, and also helping to provide climate finance to help with adaptation.""

This year's COP was dubbed an ""implementation COP"" because the focus has not been on reaching an agreement but instead on making sure countries are delivering on their existing commitments.

For Mr Bond that is fundamentally changing the role of governments in climate action.

""The function of governments was to spark this change. And now that they've done that, they need to get out of the way, actually, and allow it to happen,"" he says.

But for Dr Mohideen, governments are still critical for ensuring the transition is as smooth and equitable as possible.

""In a lot of countries … there's a gap between policies that exist and what's happening on the ground in terms of new renewable energy systems and programs being rolled out,"" she says.

“Political will is necessary to develop strong policy.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a078f7cb8feb59b517b87a7d16af05cd?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2132&cropW=3791&xPos=0&yPos=197&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:24.708017

“We’re likely to see a lot less infrastructure built, paired with an increase in energy demand,” Weeks said.","What is the future of renewables in New Hampshire, and how can citizens help make it happen?

The future of renewable energy in New Hampshire will depend on community collaboration, smarter energy management and policy changes that support local projects, according to speakers at a Community Conversation on Wednesday hosted by the Monadnock Center for History and Culture and the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript.

Speakers said residents can support renewable energy by enrolling in demand response programs, using smart thermostats, supporting warrant articles for municipal projects, and advocating for policy changes such as higher net metering caps.

The panel featured Gabe Chelius, a circuit rider for Clean Energy New Hampshire; Jennifer Runyon of Eversource’s Demand Response Team; and Dan Weeks, vice president of business development for ReVision Energy.

Chelius said his organization helps municipalities and small businesses identify, plan and finance energy-saving and renewable-energy projects, and connects them with contractors, grant opportunities and model warrant articles. He said that some recent projects will generate substantial long-term savings for small businesses.

When asked by Monadnock Center for History and Culture Director Michelle Stahl about help specifically for nonprofits, Chelius admitted that there is not a lot of help for that sector in terms of grant funding, calling it the “biggest gap” in the funding opportunities that Clean Energy New Hampshire tracks.

“There simply aren’t enough programs to help them,” Chelius said. “It’s a huge issue; there’s a massive void.”

Runyon spoke about the purpose of the Demand Response Team, which she said was about taking demand off the grid during peak hours. She said that the entire grid is sized to meet its peak demand, even though it does not need that capacity most of the time.

“And so, if the peak demand keeps growing, we have to keep growing the grid,” Runyon explained.

Eversource’s voluntary demand response program allows the utility to make minor adjustments to participating residents’ smart thermostats or home battery systems during peak hours, typically early evenings in the summer.

“One person doing that is not going to save a lot of energy, but when you have 100,000, which demand response does, it makes a difference,” Runyon said.

Runyon said participation at scale reduces stress on the grid and can limit costly upgrades. Residents who enroll get a stipend — $50 for smart thermostats and $3,000 for eligible battery systems. Runyon said the company buys back battery power in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but not yet in New Hampshire, though the stipend is calculated to cover the average price of the electricity generated.

Weeks said New Hampshire trails neighboring states in solar adoption due to state policies.

“So it’s not geography, it’s not climate — it’s policy,” Weeks said.

One way to open up new solar projects is to increase the net metering cap for solar power generation for all systems. Weeks pointed to the state’s 1-megawatt cap on community solar projects for residential and commercial users. Larger systems up to 5 megawatts are allowed only for municipalities and school districts. Legislative efforts to raise those caps are underway.

Weeks also noted that the federal 30 percent solar investment tax credit, which has helped reduce the upfront cost of installations, expires at the end of the year, likely slowing small-scale solar development.

“We’re likely to see a lot less infrastructure built, paired with an increase in energy demand,” Weeks said.

First Solar is America’s leading photovoltaic solar technology and manufacturing company, according to its website.
Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, company officials said.
“This is more than just a manufacturing facility.
It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” Widmar said.","NEW IBERIA, La. (KLFY) — First Solar, Inc. today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish.

The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year.

First Solar is America’s leading photovoltaic solar technology and manufacturing company, according to its website. Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor-based solar cells. These cells are connected into larger panels, which can be used in various applications from small devices like calculators to large-scale utility solar farms.

Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, company officials said.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The facility, which officials claim has no dependencies on Chinese supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority, the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity.

Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish, according to First Solar CEO Mark Widmar.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility.

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. “Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

Demand from U.S. data centers is expected to reach 606 TWh by 2030, a drastic increase from 147 TWh in 2023.
SEIA said that solar and storage are the fastest energy resources to deploy and the most capable of meeting the scale of electricity demand growth.
Developing a utility-scale solar project typically takes just 1.4 years, and batteries 1.7 years, significantly faster than other energy technologies, it said.
SEIA emphasizes that swift federal action is necessary to ensure the U.S. can power the AI innovations of tomorrow.","The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), representing over 1,200 companies and 280,000 workers in the U.S. solar and storage industry, has formally submitted comments to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Request for Information (RFI) regarding rapidly expanding grid capacity.

SEIA argues that while the U.S. must sustain its AI dominance, achieving this requires affordable, reliable energy, a goal currently stymied by “onerous and unstable permitting policies and insufficient transmission capacity.”

Soaring demand, failing infrastructure

After decades of flat power demand, the grid is seeing significant increases in load growth, primarily from data centers and AI infrastructure. Demand from U.S. data centers is expected to reach 606 TWh by 2030, a drastic increase from 147 TWh in 2023.

The existing grid is ill-equipped for this surge, said SEIA. Over 70% of transmission and distribution assets are past the midpoint of their 50-year life expectancy. Furthermore, the rate of new transmission construction has dramatically dropped from an average of 1,700 miles per year in the early 2010s to just 350 miles between 2020 and 2023.

These issues, coupled with supply chain constraints for crucial equipment like transformers, with lead times of up to 144 weeks, are contributing to shrinking reserve margins and potential electricity supply shortfalls warned by grid operators like PJM and MISO.

SEIA said that solar and storage are the fastest energy resources to deploy and the most capable of meeting the scale of electricity demand growth. Developing a utility-scale solar project typically takes just 1.4 years, and batteries 1.7 years, significantly faster than other energy technologies, it said.

This rapid deployment is supported by a robust domestic supply chain; domestic solar module production tripled in 2024, and U.S. factories can now produce enough finished solar modules to meet nearly all domestic demand. Over $47 billion in manufacturing investments have been committed across 41 states, said the report.

However, the current permitting regime is creating significant risk. SEIA analysis finds that the completion of over 71 GW of solar and 42 GW of storage capacity, representing 74% of all capacity under development scheduled for 2026 to 2030, is at risk due to recent permitting policies. SEIA claims the current “moratorium” on permitting is accelerating a resource adequacy problem.

Call to action for the DOE

To mitigate these risks, SEIA is urging the DOE to utilize existing programs to encourage transmission investment, such as the Transmission Facilitation Program (TFP) and the Loan Programs Office (LPO). The association also recommends the DOE coordinate with federal and state agencies to standardize load forecasting and expedite permits for late-stage projects near new loads.

Natural gas cannot fill the gap, as these projects face their own delays, cost volatility, and supply chain issues, said the report. SEIA emphasizes that swift federal action is necessary to ensure the U.S. can power the AI innovations of tomorrow.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/pexels-pixabay-356036-1200x789.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:33.201409

Facility forecast to raise Iberia Parish’s GDP by 4.4% in first full year of operations at capacity

Largest American solar manufacturer expects almost 18 GW of domestic production capacity in 2027

TEMPE, AZ. – First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year. Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s American manufacturing footprint to 14 GW in 2026, and 17.7 GW in 2027, when a recently announced production facility in South Carolina is expected to be fully ramped.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“First Solar’s investment in Iberia Parish represents the kind of forward-looking growth that reinforces Louisiana’s leadership in energy and advanced manufacturing,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “By pairing innovation with our state’s long-standing energy expertise and world-class workforce, this project creates lasting opportunities for Louisiana and bolsters American energy security.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“Today’s inauguration ceremony marks a transformative moment for Iberia Parish,” Iberia Industrial Development Foundation President and CEO Michael J. Tarantino said. “We are grateful for First Solar’s commitment and investment in our community, and we are proud to welcome their contribution to our growing energy portfolio. We look forward to seeing “Made in Iberia Parish, Louisiana” come to life.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

“First Solar’s inauguration marks an incredible milestone for Iberia Parish and the entire Acadiana region,” One Acadiana President & CEO Troy Wayman said. “We’re proud to celebrate alongside both our state and local partners at Louisiana Economic Development and Iberia Industrial Development Foundation as we see this investment come to life — bringing quality jobs, new economic activity, and continued momentum for our manufacturing and energy sectors.”

The Trump administration is bankrolling the restart of two shuttered nuclear plants in hopes of reviving the industry. Those endeavors are moving along — but without federal funding, plans to build new large nuclear reactors haven’t made much progress yet.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office announced that it had both offered — and finalized — a $1 billion loan to help Constellation Energy restart Unit 1 at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

While Three Mile Island may make you think of nuclear disaster due to the partial meltdown of the plant’s Unit 2 back in 1979, that part of the facility has been dormant ever since. Unit 1, meanwhile, operated for decades without any major incident before it was shut down in 2019 for economic reasons. Constellation said in July 2024 that the unit remained in ​“pretty good shape” and was ​“technically feasible” to restart.

Just a few months later, Constellation got its chance to do so. Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation to buy power from Unit 1, with hopes of getting the newly renamed Crane Clean Energy Center operating again by 2028. At the time, Constellation said it would likely spend $1.6 billion on the restart. This new federal loan will put a big dent in that cost.

The Loan Programs Office is also supporting the restart of Michigan’s Palisades Nuclear Plant, which shuttered in 2022. The $1.5 billion loan was initiated under the Biden administration, and President Donald Trump’s DOE has continued paying it out this year. The plant received its first delivery of fuel in October and aims to start generating power before the year ends.

While large nuclear restarts are rolling along, new construction doesn’t have much progress to show. Construction of the last major nuclear project in the U.S. — Georgia Power’s Plant Vogtle — went billions of dollars over budget and took years longer than expected. It’s become a cautionary tale for risk-averse utilities, who have yet to answer Trump’s call for a nuclear buildout, E&E News reports.

Still, the Trump administration is trying to will that nuclear renaissance into existence: This week it reaffirmed its commitment to an $80 billion plan to finance the construction of up to 10 new large nuclear reactors, first announced in late October.

It’s an ambitious goal that could create the nuclear expansion the Trump administration says it wants. But it still faces a big barrier: the administration itself. Trump officials have spent the last year undermining trust in federal financing by reneging on billions of dollars in grants, loans, and even permits for clean-energy projects. Those moves could make it difficult to convince companies to commit to expensive, years-long construction projects that will surely span administrations.

Ohio county takes on renewables ban

Ohio is a hot spot for local renewable-energy bans, but one county may pave the way for change.

A state law allows Ohio counties to bar significant solar and wind development in all or some of their townships. More than three dozen counties have done so, and Richland County is among them, with commissioners moving this summer to ban projects in 11 of its 18 townships.

Richland County residents started pushing back almost immediately, Canary Media’s Kathiann M. Kowalski reports. Gathering more than 3,300 valid signatures, they’ve ensured a referendum on the ban will be on the ballot this May, allowing every voter to weigh in on the future of clean energy in their backyard.

As COP30 closes, final deal remains unsettled

The United Nations’ COP30 conference comes to a close today, but participating nations still haven’t reached a final agreement to scale up their climate commitments. On Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the eventual deal must be ​“concrete on funding and adaptation, credible on emission cuts, and bankable on finance.”

As they do at every COP, nations disagreed over how far to take the conference-ending agreement. Climate-adaptation funding became a top issue, as countries on the front lines of climate change pushed to triple an annual adaptation fund $120 billion. More than 80 countries also called for the COP30 deal to include a road map for transitioning off coal, oil, and natural gas, scaling up 2023’s nonbinding agreement that nations begin moving away from fossil fuels.

Companies should consider what manufacturing activities (including import of any PFAS chemicals or import of PFAS-containing mixtures or articles) may fall outside of this exclusion and therefore be subject to reporting under the PFAS reporting rule.
Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard.
The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule.
In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months.","On October 11, 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a final rule pursuant to section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) imposing a one-time reporting obligation on entities that manufactured (including imported) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at any time between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022, to the extent the information is “known or reasonably ascertainable.” “Manufacture” is defined to mean manufacture (including import) “for a commercial purpose.” Information required to be reported includes company and plant site information, chemical-specific information, categories of use, manufactured amounts, by-product reporting, environmental and health effects, worker exposure data, and disposal data; reporting is required on a chemical-specific basis and for each “site” where the chemical is manufactured/imported. This rule is the direct result of a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2020, which required EPA to require reporting by PFAS manufacturers. EPA therefore did not have flexibility with respect to whether to finalize the rule; they did, however, have discretion with respect to the scope of the rule, including whether to apply exemptions found in other TSCA contexts (for example, exemptions for article importers, the manufacture of by-products and impurities, and manufacture for research and development (R&D) purposes). Despite overwhelming public comment regarding the need for such exemptions, EPA declined to apply any of these exemptions in the 2023 final rule.

Application to “Chemical Substances”; Exclusion of FDA-Regulated Substances – The PFAS reporting rule applies to “chemical substances,” which is defined by TSCA § 3 to exclude “any food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device (as such terms are defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) when manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for use as a food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device.” As a general matter, the rule’s direct impact on companies working under FDA oversight, including those in the drug, biologics, food, medical device, and cosmetics sectors, may be relatively limited. Companies should consider what manufacturing activities (including import of any PFAS chemicals or import of PFAS-containing mixtures or articles) may fall outside of this exclusion and therefore be subject to reporting under the PFAS reporting rule. For example, applicability of the exemption is less clear when PFAS are produced (or PFAS/PFAS-containing articles are imported) for multiple end uses.

Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard. Data reported under the rule (unless covered by a valid and timely confidential business information (CBI) claim) will be publicly available and available to competitors, advocacy groups, and plaintiffs’ attorneys.

The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window

EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule. Specifically, in a November 13, 2025 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA announced that it is proposing to exempt the following “manufacture” from the scope of reportable PFAS manufacturing activity under the rule:

Import of PFAS in articles

PFAS in mixtures or articles below 0.1% (a “de minimis” exemption)

Manufacture of PFAS as by-products, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates and

Manufacture (including import) of PFAS in small quantities for R&D purposes (specifically, in such “quantities of a chemical substance manufactured, imported, or processed or proposed to be manufactured, imported, or processed solely for research and development that are not greater than reasonably necessary for such purposes”)

EPA has also proposed changing the reporting window. Currently, the reporting window is currently set to open April 13, 2026; most reporting entities have 6 months to report, except that small manufacturers that are required to report only because of their import of PFAS-containing articles have a full year. In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months. (Because, under the proposal, article importers would not be required to report, there would be no need for a longer reporting window for small manufacturer article importers.)

Next Steps and Looking Ahead

EPA will accept comments on the proposal through December 29, 2025. Companies should evaluate potential obligations under the existing rule and whether the proposed revisions align with operational and strategic priorities; consider submitting comments to individually or through industry associations to ensure relevant stakeholder perspectives are reflected in the administrative record.

The TSCA PFAS reporting rulemaking highlights the breadth of federal PFAS oversight, as well as the growing intersection between EPA’s PFAS-focused initiatives and the FDA’s ongoing oversight of chemicals and materials used in food and medical products. Parallel monitoring of both agencies’ regulatory initiatives is essential to effectively manage compliance, supply chain transparency, and associated liability considerations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16153_4556.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 15:02:06.313819

This major investment, made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by the Democratic Congress and signed by President Joe Biden, will enable the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to replace aging coaches with new hybrid diesel-electric motor coaches – strengthening the City’s transit network and improving air quality for communities across San Francisco.

“Thanks to Democrats’ Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, San Francisco continues to modernize our transportation system while combating the climate crisis,” Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said. “This funding will help replace aging coaches with cleaner, more reliable buses—delivering safer commutes, reducing pollution and increasing economic opportunities for working families across the Bay Area. Our progress stands as a reminder of what a productive Democratic Congress can deliver.""

“I am thrilled San Francisco earned federal funding to help modernize its essential public transit system, which clocked over 150 million passenger trips last year,” said Congressman Kevin Mullin. “Public transit is the backbone of our economy and people across America rely on it to get to work, school and home. Democrats led passage of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law because we know that when we invest in cleaner, more efficient transportation, we protect public health, mitigate environmental impacts, and create a more enjoyable experience for riders.”

“Modern, reliable buses are essential to keeping San Francisco moving. This federal investment strengthens our ability to provide excellent service today while accelerating the agency’s efforts to avoid costly breakdowns and loss of service,"" said SFMTA Director of Transportation Julie Kirschbaum. ""We thank the Department of Transportation for supporting reliable public transit, especially at a time when our financial outlook is unpredictable.”

The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency will receive $39,800,000 for new hybrid diesel-electric motor coaches that will replace a portion of its aging fleet. These improvements will help reduce maintenance costs, increase system reliability and enhance service across San Francisco and northern San Mateo County while supporting California's long-term climate goals.

The recording and slides of this presentation will be sent to everyone who's registered, for this event after the event concludes, so you will have access to those. If you have any questions, please feel free to drop them in the Q and A window, and we'll do our best to address all of them over the course of the presentation today. With that, we'll start introductions. I can quickly introduce myself. My name is Amy Yoon. I am part of Crux's Stock Capital Markets investor coverage team here at Crux. So I've actually met many of you already who registered for the webinar. And I'm very excited to share what we've been able to observe in the market for the first half of the year what we anticipate for the remainder of twenty twenty five and beyond. I will now hand it over to Katie Bays and Charlotte Caldwell, our marketing and business team for their introductions. Great. Charlotte, why don't you go first and then I'll jump in and start the presentation. Sounds good. Hi, everyone. I'm Charlotte Caldwell. I'm an analyst on the market intelligence team with Katie. I started at Crux about six months ago and very excited to hopefully share some helpful takeaways from our market intelligence report. Great. And I'm Katie Bays. I lead Crux's market intelligence practice, and I've been with the company since twenty twenty three. Let's get into the data. So I wanted to start with kind of a snapshot of where Crux's data comes from. This is such a common question that we get from lenders and from everybody. What is our data representative of? Crux has been surveying the tax credit market and the tax equity markets over the course of the last two and a half years. We have a database that sits at currently forty billion dollars of completed tax credit transactions, and it covers essentially every major tax credit category, more than a dozen different technology types. And this is where so much of our data is rooted. We, of course, we do have a marketplace on Crux. We have done more than one hundred and twenty transactions since our company began to operate, but the data that we have from our own activity is heavily supplemented by the data that we get from market participants such as yourselves. So we do consider the database to be relatively market representative. And for folks who have come to utilize and rely on this data, hopefully, you have found it to be so and that it's been helpful to your process. Let's get into our mid year market intelligence report and some of the core takeaways from that. You'll find a quick outline of our discussion topics on the screen here. We're going to start by touching on policy. Policy has, of course, been extremely dynamic in twenty twenty five and continues to be. We'll talk through the latest state of play with respect to key policy issues. We'll share some takeaways from the tax credit market in the first half of twenty twenty five and some of the key drivers of growth that we've observed in that market. Then we'll talk through pricing. Pricing is one of the most significant commercial terms in a tax credit transaction. It's one of the factors that we watch really closely, and so we will share general pricing dynamics, trends, and rules that we've observed. I'll then hand it back to Charlotte to talk about the tax credit insurance market. She's recently published a paper unpacking the nature of tax credit insurance at present, and we'll cover some of the core findings from that research. Then finally, we'll talk a little bit about what we've seen in the second half of this year so far and take questions at the end. With that, I want to encourage everybody to use, if you have questions, use WSIA's Q and A feature. There's a question mark inside of a talking bubble, and so you can submit questions there. As we receive them, we will certainly answer them, try to leave some time at the end to make sure that we can do that. Without further ado, let's jump into the policy. I think just as a table setting comment, as everyone is largely aware, this summer, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed Congress. It enacted a variety of changes. Maybe just as important were the things that the bill did not change. So while the bill did restrict the use of tax credits for wind and solar facilities that either begin construction after July fourth of next year or enter service after twenty twenty seven. It retained tax credits for most other technologies, and importantly transferability was retained for all different varieties of tax credits to which it had previously applied. Then there was one small tax credit category which was actually added to the transferability category. So generally speaking, even though there are these new restrictions placed wind and solar, the industry was largely, I think, untouched in the short term by some of the policy changes that were enacted in the context of the tax bill. There were some important changes to how the tax credits will be accessible in the future related to the foreign entity of concern rules, and we'll talk about that in greater depth. Importantly, we get to keep a lot of the familiar aspects of the core ITC and PTC tax code, the safe harbor function, the use of start construction to establish the right to safe harbor credits. In many ways, the tax regime has continued to exist largely similar format after the one big beautiful bill. But let's talk about kind of the core difference that I think a lot of folks in the market are processing, which is Fiat. So foreign entity of concern, set of rules that had previously applied to electric vehicles, which have been expanded now to apply to a variety of other tax credits, significantly the Section 48EITC and the Section 45Y PTC, as well as Section 45X advanced manufacturing PTCs amongst others, but those kind of being the most significantly affected. The implementation of the FIOQ rules really begins next year. There are different pillars of FIOC, which we'll talk through, but the implementation dates for those different pillars are non uniform. There are some considerations around when which provisions begin to kick in. We'll talk through that. Let's actually skip to the next slide and we can just kind of jump into it. So of the three pillars, the first pillar that we're going to discuss here is effective control. So the effective control provision intends to look at whether or not there are contracts that a company has entered, which are subject to fiat, which means that they're either entered after July fourth of twenty twenty five, or they have payments that persist after July fourth of twenty twenty five. Those contracts will be reviewed and evaluated from the point of view of whether or not those contracts confer effective control onto a prohibited foreign entity or a specified foreign entity. So that's the specified foreign entity could be a Chinese company owned by the Chinese government, but it could also be a Chinese individual, national company domiciled in China. So it's a bit more of a wide ranging definition. And the question here is in terms of which provisions effectively confer control onto those entities. Crux, Charlotte and I specifically have undertaken a process with a group of about five dozen manufacturers and companies that are building projects to evaluate their state of readiness with respect to implementing fiat. This is a core issue that companies are well down the path of trying to review their contracts and determine whether there are effective control clauses in there and then renegotiate those contracts to remove those clauses. But there's a lot of uncertainty. I think as folks will know, the Treasury has not issued any guidance related to the implementation of FIOQ yet, so which provisions in contracts and which contracts one must review is kind of an unknown question at this time, so that creates a certain amount of uncertainty and risk in the short term. Not a whole lot of time to figure this out. The phase in dates or the dates in which this provision applies are pretty much across the board, twenty twenty six for all parties. Even those projects that began construction in twenty twenty five or twenty four, it's more specifically twenty twenty five, projects that began construction this year but enter service next year will still be subject to the effective control provisions. Let's go to the next. Ownership is another critical test. There's two categories of ownership that the ownership rules look at: they look at the specified foreign entity, which is sort of a broad category, and then they also look at foreign influence entities or entities that are significantly owned by specified foreign entities. So, again, many companies have undertaken processes to try to evaluate whether or not their ownership flags against these ownership rules, but these rules as well kick in starting next year. So again, projects and tax credits that are generated within calendar year twenty twenty six, if they are among the categories that are listed on the screen here, the tech neutral ITC and PTC, 45X, Q, U, and Z, any of those tax credits will need to satisfy ownership rules in order to be qualified to generate tax credits. Let's go to the next. And then this is the supply chain. So material assistance is the third pillar of Fiat. I think this is actually one of the pillars that is best understood by folks in the market and and folks generally regard as one of the more, if not manageable or navigable, because all of Fiat is pretty complicated, at least one of the areas where you've got the clear sort of roadmap of what you are looking at. But in a general sense, companies need to satisfy that no more than a specified percentage of the costs incurred in the construction of that facility were incurred to certain foreign entities, specified foreign entities. The test here is a cost base. Companies have the option of using the domestic content safe harbor tables as a proxy for overall facility cost apportionment. And that that is, I think, as we understand, is generally what many companies are doing. The applicability of these rules is also a little bit delayed relative to the last two. Material assistance does not apply to facilities that began construction in twenty twenty five. It will apply to users of the 45Y, 48E tax credits that begin construction in twenty twenty six or later. It also applies to any 45X eligible tax credits that are generated beginning in twenty twenty six. There's a bit of a staggered implementation timeline for material assistance, but that broadly speaking is the three main pillars of FIOC. I know that we started our presentation with the most complicated thing, but I wanted to make sure we got this information out there. If folks have questions, feel free to ask them. Let's move on to the safe harbor quickly and then we can kind of dive into our market commentary. Wanted to just touch on again very quickly the safe harbor dates that have been somewhat updated in the aftermath of the one big beautiful bill. IRS's folks will be aware did release new safe harbor rules. Any facility that began construction prior to September second of this year can apply the legacy safe harbor regime. That means using the five percent cost test or the physical work test. Any facility that began construction September second or later has to comply with the new set of rules, which are substantially similar, but restrict the use of the five percent safe harbor to facilities that are smaller than one point five megawatts. We wanted to plot out kind of what the hypothetical combined beginning of construction, continuous construction, safe harbor windows accommodate, and it is essentially this that facilities have to begin construction, presuming they begin construction after that September second date, begin construction by July fourth of twenty twenty six, and then have to enter service essentially by either the end of December twenty twenty nine or the end of December two thousand thirty, subject to when they began construction to earn the tax credits that they have safe harbored into. There are caveats to that. The continuous construction test is not absolute. Companies can present that they've made continuous effort outside of that four year window of time, but the most straightforward application of the continuous construction test is the four year continuity safe harbor. That's what this figure is intended to represent. Then we'll go to the next slide very quickly, Charlotte. Just as a synthesis, this sort of outlines all of the rules related to the beginning of construction requirements. For anyone who needs that refresher, this slide is here. It's a bit of a desk reference, and as Amy said, we will distribute this material to everybody on the line as well. Let's go on to the next, Charlotte. I'll hand it over to you to run through some of our initial findings. Thanks, Katie. Okay. So the next section is kind of synthesizing, a bunch of different takeaways from the market, but the overall takeaway is that we saw significant growth in the first half of this year. So Crux's market data shows that the total value of tax credit sales exceeded twenty billion dollars in the first half of this year. So this this figure here in the light blue, you have first half of twenty twenty four, dark blue is first half of twenty twenty five. The first two columns are showing previous year vintages transacting in the current year. So that would be twenty twenty three vintages transacting in twenty twenty four. Twenty twenty four is transacting in twenty twenty five. And those have risen up to five point seven billion dollars in the first half of this year from two point five billion dollars last year, which is a significant growth. And then we also saw a significant growth in the current year category as well. So that's the next two columns. Those rose to twelve point three billion dollars from nine billion dollars And again, this growth is happening in spite of policy. So there was so much underlying momentum in the market that it was able to continue growing despite the policy uncertainty that characterized the first half of this year that Katie kind of covered in the last section. And, again, that's just due to a high number of historic investment decisions that have supported the continued growth in tax credit supply that we've seen over the past few years. And we also are seeing a bit of growth on the forward side as well. So that's the four columns on the right. So some buyers are taking positions on credits that will be generated in twenty twenty six and beyond, but you can see the overall volume is not nearly as high as the other two categories, and the increase year over year isn't as dramatic. And then this slide kind of zooms out a little bit. We have data from the Clean Investment Monitor showing total investment in energy and manufacturing, and that's stabilized at about thirty five billion dollars a quarter, which is elevated relative to the period before twenty twenty three. So as there's been lots of headwinds and public project cancellations in the market, this is just showing that there's still a large amount of capital deployment and strong market fundamentals. And one of the areas of growth that we've seen is in transfers out of tax equity structures specifically. So in general, for all tax equity commitments in twenty twenty five, we're estimating an increase to thirty two to thirty five billion dollars from twenty nine billion dollars last year. And, again, a big source of that growth is those transfers out of tax equity structures. So that's represented by the yellow on this figure, and we're expecting those to almost double from seven billion dollars to eleven to thirteen billion dollars this year. And then this figure here shows kind of a different cut of the same, you know, breaking down by financing structure across different technology types. And there's some interesting patterns that you can see. So utility scale solar has the highest access to TE at about seventy two percent. A lot of that is due to the track record of the developers that are developing these utility scale solar projects. And then smaller, more distributed technologies like CNI or community solar rely on TE much less often at only about twenty percent. And that's due to a combination of potentially some of these developers not having the same track record as utility scale, but also a lot of these projects are merchant or partially merchant. And typically, TE investors prefer fully contracted projects. So this is showing that for certain tech types, tax equity is limited, but transferability has introduced these creative capital solutions that are allowing these companies that historically couldn't access tax equity to utilize the benefits of working with an investor to achieve a step up and monetize their tax credits more efficiently. So in other words, the reason the financing structure matters is because structures that involve bringing on an investor allow an ITC entity to achieve a step up, whereas in a direct transfer, they're calculating that, off of the cost segregation report. So they're just able to monetize their tax credits more efficiently and calculate their step up based off fair market value rather than the cost seg report. And then another takeaway that we have seen is that storage and solar plus storage grew rapidly in in the beginning of this year. So they went from a combined nine percent in the beginning of twenty twenty four to twenty six percent of the market share in the beginning of twenty twenty five. And there's a couple of different factors that are playing into that. So we've seen technology improvements and cost improvements for batteries, which just makes it easier to incorporate them into facilities. But we've also seen increased demand for reliable and dispatchable energy, especially from data centers. On the flip side, we saw tax credits from wind facilities decline pretty substantially. So those went from thirty three percent to nine point five percent. And that's just exemplifying that the benefits of the market aren't seen equally across different participants, whether that be different technology types or investment grade sellers versus non investment grade sellers, which we'll talk about in a second when when Katie goes over pricing. And then finally, we're just seeing that the market is diversifying. So not only did we see storage and solar plus storage increase, but nuclear and advanced manufacturing are also up year over year. So those went from, combined less than twenty percent of the market to more than fifty percent of the market. And that's just one of the things that we we do expect this to continue and continue to see more diversified technology types enter the market. Right. And with that, I will pass it to Katie to cover pricing. Great. Thank you, Charlotte. All right. The broad takeaway here is that we have historically observed relatively strong pricing in the tax credit market. Let's go to the next slide. The trajectory in general for twenty twenty five has been sort of a downward trajectory on price. It's not a uniform experience across the market. One of the things that we've endeavored to do in this, the portion of the analysis here is to really bifurcate between the investment grade and non investment grade sponsors. Just to spend a second talking about who that is. Investment grade sponsor in our definition is really anybody who can convey an investment grade indemnity, and so that'll typically be a utility company, but it will also include situations where we know, there's a tax equity partner who is conveying a bank level indemnity along with a credit, even though the underlying sponsor in that deal is not themselves. Investment grade, those guys are generally observing and experiencing a slightly different market than everybody else. What we have on the screen here is a sort of very broad strokes average pricing for investment tax credits based upon those two designations. Historically, we've seen ITC's transact at ninety two point five cents. That's been a pretty persistent annual average between twenty twenty three, twenty twenty four. But then getting into twenty twenty five, what we found was that the market really bifurcated. There's always been a moderate premium for an IG seller, maybe a penny, but that percentage of that premium has really blown out to more like a three cent increase over the non IGE seller. So for our investment grade group, we generally saw pricing in the neighborhood of around ninety four cents, very strong. As far as ITC pricing goes, That would be sort of the, I would say the seventy fifth percentile of the market, sort of the top end of the ITC pricing. Then we have our of our everybody else, the non investment grade category. And for those sponsors, we actually observed a pretty significant decrease in pricing, around ninety one cents on average across all deal sizes, technology. So just again, at the ITC category as a whole. The divergence on the PTC side was observable, but not as significant. So we'll get into that a little bit more here in a sec. But this is, I think, generally, I think important table setting context in terms of what kinds of pricing we've observed in twenty twenty five. And just to get into the why, there are a couple of factors. One is obviously the policy uncertainty that hung over the market in the first half. There was a lot of back and forth between tax credit buyers and sellers over the indemnity package, the nature of the indemnity, particularly in the context of changes in law, retroactive changes in law. The sellers that could essentially respond to that uncertainty by providing an investment grade indemnity that, you know, the buyer will be made whole if there is a retroactive change in law, which fortunately there was not, but it was certainly a worry for parts of twenty twenty five. Think those folks experienced a more liquid dynamic market. People that could not offer that or had to kind of adjudicate that issue in the context of tax credit insurance, I think generally saw less liquidity. And so As we've gone into twenty twenty five or the second half of the year, we'll talk about this more, this dynamic has continued to hold and maybe become even a little bit more exaggerated. Let's go to the next. It's a very busy slide. I know it's probably harder to read on the screen, but for folks who will receive the deck, can go back and reference. This is very detailed data. What we have here is the distribution of average prices across the three major solar type categories based upon deal size. There's a couple of things here to note. One is that we do generally observe a positive correlation between deal size and price. Larger deals achieve certain economies of scale, generally transact at higher prices for buyers who want to transact in that, you know, several hundred million to, you know, maybe a billion dollar tax credit category, the quantum of savings that they can achieve, even at relatively high, you know, ninety four, ninety six level pricing is still pretty large. So the juice is well worth the squeeze. Smaller deals have a variety of other impediments. So when you get to the other end of the market deals under ten million dollars Charlotte will unpack that in greater detail in the context of insurance, but that's where you tend to see the lowest pricing in the market. That deal size relationship continues to hold as we have historically observed. The other things that we noticed are, of course, we have historically utility scale solar deals tended to transact at higher prices, investment grade utility scale sponsors got particularly high prices and price was very convergent. Really across all deal sizes, you're generally seeing pretty consistent pricing between say like ninety three and ninety six cents. For those non IG sponsors, pricing's a little bit lower, but still relatively high in the context of all of the other solar categories. We get into distributed solar. That's where we've actually seen some year over year movement in terms of where pricing kind of has softened and where it hasn't. C and I solar last year was the lowest priced segment of the solar market. We did not see that this year. We actually saw that resi solar dropped below C and I on average pricing for most categories. So we generally have seen, you know, relatively low pricing across all the distributed categories, but that resi was the lowest, followed by C and I being then a little bit higher. A lot of variation across deal sizes for both of those types, but we, you know, again, kind of have seen that those two categories price below utility scale and generally transact with a little less liquidity. Let's go to the next. So one of our other kind of major tech types, the wind production tax credits, this really forms a good example of the higher priced part of the market. Wind PTCs are generally pretty liquid, transact in a pretty liquid market. As Charlotte noted, we've seen a bit of a decline in terms of the overall market concentration of wind PTCs. We're seeing more of them transact on a long term strip basis, not on a spot basis. The general kind of trajectory of pricing is what you see on the screen here. There is a bit of a gulf between the non investment grade and investment grade win PTC sellers, but I think this is representative of really a category of the market where you do have a lot of investment grade participants, and the non IG group is a little bit thinner. We don't actually have as much data for that group here. Let's go to the next. Then the advanced manufacturing PTCs, just to kind of go to the other side of the market, we've got these two really established categories, solar and wind, and then we've got the sort of new category, which is the advanced manufacturing section 45X PTC. Wanted to show what we're seeing in terms of average pricing there as well. 45X PTCs have transacted at pretty high prices. We've seen some recent weakness in that, so in the third and the fourth quarter of this year, I would say the average prices declined somewhat relative to what you see on the screen, But as a general matter, we do tend to see 45X transact at relatively high prices. Charlotte will cover, I think, little bit more on what the prevalence of insurance is for this group. But we do see, we'll typically not see insurance very frequently on most PTC deals. We do see insurance on 45X deals more often. I think with that, maybe we want to take a moment and answer a couple of questions. Amy, I do see a few. Yeah, thank you, Katie. It looks like we've shared a lot of data across technologies and even how 45X compares to some of the mature solar tax credits. Is there any data that we can share on the pricing gap for perhaps 45Q or 45V in comparison to solar tax credits? Yeah. So I think that what we are seeing, we haven't seen a ton of 45Y. We have seen a couple of deals, but it's not been a super abundant part of the market. I would say that what we typically see is in terms of the newer 45Q is not new, but in terms of some of the newer PTC technologies, it is not uncommon that you will see pricing in the 80s, let's say maybe the higher 80s for a lot of those tax credits. Then what we have seen, I think 45Q, it's been just a little bit higher, probably closer to ninety or ninety two cents gross. Although I should say all the prices that we are sharing are gross prices paid by the buyer. There are transaction costs, are typically paid by the seller that reduce net pricing to the seller, but that would, I think generally be where we have seen those credits transact. They're not at the level of like a wind PTC or even 45X, but they are relatively strong pricing. There's good indication of market demand, I would say for all of the fuels production tax credits, particularly 45Q, very in demand, 45Z, the new clean fuels PTC has also been very in demand. There are unique insurance considerations for both, but there is a market for both of those credits and pricing I think has generally been relatively strong, if not at the level of a wind PTC. Does that make sense? Yeah, super helpful. As we cover pricing data, I think the next part of the data looks at how market participants are really allocating risk through insurance. For those of you who want to learn more, we actually just published our first insurance white pig bearer, which has been reviewed by all major insurance companies. And this is downloadable on our website, cruxclimate dot com, for further details. So with that, I'll hand it over to Charlotte, who will be covering our data on insurance. Awesome. Thanks, Amy. Okay. So in general, from, like, the widest view, there wasn't a huge change year over year in the percent of ITCs and PTCs obtaining insurance. So sixty to seventy percent of ITC deals have insurance, where twenty two to twenty three percent of PTCs have insurance. And again, ITCs have more inherent risks. So that's why they're just insured at a higher percentage, a high percent of the time. But in general, it's a very dynamic market that is tightening. So we've seen a lot of the input costs into insurance increase. So minimum fees are rising. Underwriting fees are rising. Those have gone from fifty to ninety thousand dollars to closer to a hundred thousand dollars or more. And then we've also heard that portfolios are often even more expensive because they can be seen as more complicated to underwrite and insure. And as Amy mentioned, we we get into a decent amount more detail on that in our insurance guide, so definitely take a look at that if you're interested. And we have heard that the higher cost of insurance is at least partially driven by some claims that have been made against transferable tax credit policies issued in the last couple of years. So, again, just lending to that tightening market. And so this slide is looking at the premium that we're seeing either for investment grade sellers or sellers that obtain insurance. So there are two different types of indemnities that we see in deals, either the seller's investment grade or they're obtaining insurance. In other words, companies transacting with without insurance are investment grade. If you are an investment grade and you're getting insurance, you're and sorry. If you are an investment grade, you're getting insurance and or you're transacting at a lower price. So the premium is pretty similar for these two. You can see it's right at about three cents, but that's not to say that your baseline price will be the same for, if you're an investment grade seller or if you're obtaining insurance. So on average, you'll transact at a higher price, about three cents, but it's not necessarily going to be the same price as an investment grade seller would see. So in short, insurance is worth it. You're still being compensated. There is a benefit, a quantitative benefit for this, but there's also a qualitative benefit as well. You're gonna see increased liquidity. There's just not a whole lot of risk appetite on the buyer side, so they're really looking for ways to kind of shift that risk and indemnify these deals. And the next few slides, I'll go through relatively quickly, but they're just kind of showing the percentage of insurance coverage across deal size, and then we'll also look at tech tech type quickly as well. So Katie mentioned earlier, typically smaller deals are not not as likely to be insured. So about twenty percent of deals under ten million dollars obtain insurance in our dataset. Usually, insurance is just too expensive as a share of the overall deal. And then that percentage jumped significantly in the ten to twenty million dollar deal size range. It declines a little bit after that. Just a lot of those larger deals tend to be more likely to be coming from investment grade sellers. But in general, insurance is most common in deals from ten to a hundred and fifty million dollars. And then for tech type, I think looking at solar specifically does a good job of kind of highlighting some of the trends. So looking at utility scale solar, about twenty five percent of these deals have insurance, and that's almost a one to one breakdown of the non investment grade sellers versus the investment grade sellers. So that's just reiterating my earlier point that if you're investment grade, you're not obtaining insurance. If you're non investment grade, you're much more likely to obtain insurance. And then on the flip side, we see resi solar is insured over ninety percent of the time. Most I think virtually all of the listings in our dataset were coming from non investment grade sellers. So the ratio is kinda flipped there, and we're seeing most of these deals obtain insurance. And it's also interesting to look at this as a time series. So this is showing advanced manufacturing, the percentage of deals obtaining insurance over time. So you can see that's fallen from eighty percent and somewhat stabilized around forty percent. And that's just showing that buyers are becoming more comfortable with this tax credit and requiring insurance less less than they were historically. And then here we have some data on the coverage levels. So coverage typically ranges from a hundred to a hundred and forty percent of the nominal value of the credits to account for all of the losses. Solar, with the exception of resi solar, so that first dot there showing the average coverage in blue and then the range, that is one of the more standardized, averaging just slightly over one hundred percent. Whereas residential solar, can see as a much wider range. And that's because of the portfolio approach here. Partial insurance is more common just because there's not gonna be one weather related event that would take out the entire portfolio. So not as necessary to have a high insurance coverage. And then we see a a pretty wide range as well for storage, and that's because of the kind of different deal structures that we see there that can vary significantly between fully merchant all the way up to fully contracted. And then finally, biogas averaged the highest at about a hundred and thirty five percent, and that's just reflecting the risk appetite of buyers for these tax credits. Great. Thanks, Charlotte. It seems like our data indicates that that's the case, but we've had lenders who indicated that insurance costs rose up to two fifty bps recently, which is significantly affecting their deal economics. Would you say that there are still material benefits to getting insurance then? Yes. I think you're still seeing an average three cent higher bid. It's pretty clear in the data that it is still worth it. And there's just not the buyer appetite for non investment grade uninsured deals. So that's still driving the need for sellers to obtain insurance. Okay. And then secondly, I know we've talked about Fiat and some regulatory changes that we experienced this year. Is change in law or Fiat going to be part of this growing list of exclusions or, you know, is insurance taking on Fiat risk? As of right now, we're not seeing insurers take on fee up risk. I think after there's more guidance, we may see that start to be more of the case. But yeah, we haven't seen that materialize yet. Great. Now let's talk about outlook. We just published our third quarter report and we'll be sharing our twenty twenty five annual report on February twenty fourth of next year. But let's talk about the outlook and how these trends combined with policy shifts are shaping market conditions for the rest of the year and beyond. Katie? Yeah, sounds good. All right, well, we'll get into kind of our first big takeaway here is that, you know, a lot of energy and time was spent, I think, following the one big beautiful bill from the point of view of, you know, what was it going to mean for tax credits? I think in the near term, the biggest impact on the market is actually really related to what does it mean for tax credit buyers? What we've observed is that a lot of corporate taxpayers There was a huge amount of change that the bill enacted to corporate tax liabilities and how corporations are going to calculate their tax capacity. We have about three hundred active buyers on Crux. We sought data from our buyer segment on whether or not they anticipated changes to their overall tax liability from the one big beautiful bill. About seventy three percent of them said that they did, and then about sixty percent of them said that that would in turn influence the amount of tax credits that they intended to buy. Those significant parts of the market. Our presumption is that corporate tax receipts for twenty twenty five will be down between twenty and thirty percent. All of that to say the tax appetite of the most important tax credit buyer segment has significantly been reduced by some of the tax law change. If we go to the next slide, that has really in turn influenced the volume of activity and deal activity in the market. We have historically observed that as the year goes on, total market volume and the amount of deal activity that is conducted on a quarterly basis that generally rises over the course of the year with the first quarter being the slowest, the fourth quarter being the busiest. That really is not what we're seeing at present. It was not what we saw in the third quarter. There was significant softness in the market in the third quarter with a lot of buyers really, you know, whether or not they will have tax capacity for twenty twenty five, really being engaged in just trying to figure out what the tax law changes mean for them. It's not so much that buyers have all had their tax liabilities wiped out. It's more that the changes in the tax law are really complicated and it takes time for buyers to work their way through that. I think one of the things we are now hearing from buyers is that maybe they did have reduction from bonus depreciation, R and E expensing, things like that, but they are triggering the corporate alternative minimum tax so that their tax liability is being basically adjusted up by the CIMT, which presents another opportunity for those buyers to kind of come back to the tax credit market. So there's a lot of kind of push and pull factors here. The taxpayer is working their way through that, and we would expect to see in the fourth quarter a pretty significant increase in total market volume. The other kind of important caveat here if you're a lender, right, is kind of time is pretty fluid if you're the taxpayer, if you're the buyer in this market. There is no hard and fast timing pressure as to why you have to transact in calendar year twenty twenty five. Buyers that want to take the credit for the tax credits on their quarterly estimated payments certainly do have some incentive to do so then to transact earlier, but that you have to kind of recognize that that benefit exists within the context of a lot of broader uncertainty around what that tax liability is likely to be at the end of the day, right? So There's a push and a pull. We do expect to see a significant amount of volume transact of twenty twenty five tax credits transacting in calendar year twenty twenty six. I think Charlotte shared a few minutes ago that we saw just under six billion dollars of twenty twenty four vintage tax credits transacting this year. It should be a pretty active, sizable part of the market next year as well. For folks that have different kinds of lending arrangements with projects that contemplate particular milestone payments or the sale of tax credits as a particular consideration, just kind of understanding that the market right now, I think, feels a lack of urgency to transact eventually as buyers retain additional confidence in what their tax appetite is, we would expect to see that dynamism return. We are beginning to see it now, just acknowledging though that there's something like seven weeks before the end of the year, so not a whole lot of time. Let's go to our last slide here. The last slide is a forecast. We get this question pretty often, which is basically how much did the One Big Beautiful Bill reduce the overall tax capacity of the market, or how much tax credit generation is going to be affected by changes in the law. The blue line on this chart shows what our forecast was before passage of the O triple B, we essentially would have forecast that the market would continue to grow in total size up to about twenty twenty seven, kind of peaking at about sixty eight billion dollars of tax credits generated, and then declining gently thereafter. When we take out the wind and solar facilities that would no longer be eligible after twenty twenty seven, and particularly into the later parts of this decade, what we see is, of course, a reduction, but we wanted to kind of model a couple scenarios. One is that, we are sort of seeing the incentive to bolster or to upsize the storage component of a facility. We're seeing that incentive is more heavily weighted now because those storage components are retaining access to tax credits, so your ability to recover investments in shared infrastructure, for instance, between a solar and storage facility, might make that an attractive thing to increase as a share of the overall facility mix. What we try to do is model a couple scenarios, one where you just take out your solar and wind projects that are not eligible, sort of first order effect. The other scenario where we sort of increase the share of deployment of the marginally eligible or the facilities that retain eligibility. What we see in both scenarios is that the market does shrink a little bit relative to our pre OB3 case, but not by a huge amount. We generally project a relatively flat year over year market, kind of in the low to mid fifty billion dollar a year level, going through the end of the decade, kind of settling right around fifty billion or forty eight billion in those two scenarios. So that it's generally a pretty positive story. I think the fact that, you know, before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, you're looking at a market for roughly twenty billion dollars a year of total tax credit generation. We're really seeing something that's in excess of two times that through the end of the decade. It's a relatively strong market even in spite of those changes. With that, Amy, let me hand it back to you. We can take any of the last questions that we've gotten here. Yeah, sounds great. Thank you, Katie. We have a couple of questions, actually mostly on fiat as we anticipated. Katie, the first question is, what kinds of clean energy projects are viewed most risky with regards to fiat and tech credit eligibility? The second question also regarding fiat is, are there any important diligence points or deliverables for lenders to ensure the projects that they lend to don't inadvertently trigger a fiat risk, given what you shared on effective control? Yeah, so let's start with the first. I think the conventional wisdom right now is that, the US reshoring of supply chains for wind are most mature. The supply chain, if you're developing a wind facility, is typically a de minimis level of China exposure in that, It's kind of the safest aspect of the complex. Secondarily, I think we've seen a huge amount of solar manufacturing that's been reshorred such that at this point, I think the majority of solar projects are also in relatively good shape. The principal risk really in Fiat kind of centers around the battery storage side of the industry. There are a couple of major manufacturers of battery cells and components, particularly BID and cattle that are also big suppliers into the US. Accounting for, that's not an immediate problem. It doesn't necessarily mean that a facility cannot qualify for Fiat, but it does require you to be really careful about that material assistance cost ratio calculation to make sure that the components of the facility that were sourced from a Chinese supplier are not in excess of the thresholds that are articulated by that part of the rule. Those are a couple of, I think, points that are good rules of thumb right now. I think if you speak to a lot of developers, and again, we do have some data on Fiat compliance that we'll be sharing broadly on December eighth is our intended publication date for that information. What you'll generally see is actually that folks, I think, seem to have pretty sound concrete plans as to how they're planning to comply with PHYOC. Probably the biggest question, the biggest area of uncertainty is actually more on the 45X side. That's an area of the market where you do have some entities with Chinese ownership. They've generally, I think, sought to dissolve that Chinese ownership or liquidate that aspect of their ownership so that they don't have that problem going into twenty twenty six. Some facilities may not achieve that quite by December thirty first of this year, but generally speaking, 45X, I think, is the canary in the mind shaft in terms of which parts of the tax credit ecosystem have the most to work through and sort of the least amount of time to do it. Then remind me the other question I think was related to insurance or? Diligence. Diligence. Okay. In the absence of guidance, I should just say, we do expect some regulatory guidance from Treasury within the next couple of weeks. It won't be dispositive, it won't be comprehensive, but it will provide some perhaps initial insight into where IRS intends to go with the FIAC implementation. We're looking for more fulsome guidance from IRS probably in the first quarter of next year, but those milestones will settle, I think, some of the outstanding questions around diligence. Right now, we are seeing is folks are sort of taking a more is more approach. You're looking at supplier certifications. You're counting on your suppliers to make attestations and to source certifications from their suppliers, to put together a comprehensive diligence package. In a practical sense, what we are really seeing for lenders, and especially for tax equity investors, is a near term focus on legacy Section forty eight and Section forty five tax credits. What you're trying to do is you're trying to approach parts of the market where that fiat risk is extremely limited. Fiat does not apply to legacy forty eight and forty five tax credits, so those get a clear kind of advantage in the diligence process. Then the other piece that we're seeing is situations where US based ownership is obvious, the supply chain is really clear, and you can just sort of practically satisfy yourself that the fiat risk is not gonna be thrown over on the project. Those are the kinds of situations that I think people are approaching first and then we're waiting for greater standardization on what are the necessary diligence items after guidance has been released. Thank you, Katie. I think we actually have one more question. The question is, why is it so hard to invest in resi or C and I solar projects? I can answer this. I'd say at a high level, it's challenging relative to TLR scale solar portfolios from a diligence and funding perspective. So when you're comparing a one hundred megawatt utility scale portfolio with two fifty megawatt each versus a one hundred megawatt resi or C and I with five to ten megawatt each within that portfolio, the diligence undertaken is exactly the same. So it becomes extremely cumbersome to undertake that exercise from a diligence perspective. In resi, I would say also a series of bankruptcies we had in the space with SunPower, Sunnova also affected generally investor sentiment overall. And also some lenders in the resi space historically have really struggled with getting individuals as the off taker and don't view an aggregated portfolio with individuals with FICO scores as positively, just relative to an investment grade utility as an off taker, for example. I think from a funding perspective as well, there are specific funding conditions in the credit agreement. So if you'd have to get an IE certificate or a Norse de Borrowing or Lien Waivers for each of these projects to fund, again, it becomes a very cumbersome process. That said, despite the market noise at Crux, we've been continuing to support resi and C and I solar developers finance their projects at various stages. And we've been able to observe lender appetite continue to exist in this space. Of course, it really comes down to very quality sponsors with quality projects. And of course, investors and lenders being very, very selective to finding investment opportunities in the space. But I would say those are probably some of the kind of key risks that we've been able to observe, in the resi and C and I market, recently.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e46c9ca980cf228bbbbf55/6920c8e2c2fc8e847976489a_Manufacturing%2004.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:28.209332

Pflugerville, Texas – A $176 million WIFIA loan will support multiple projects modernizing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in this growing city.
This is the second WIFIA loan to the City of Pflugerville.
Joliet, Illinois – An $87 million loan will help transition the city’s drinking water supply from a stressed and unsustainable aquifer.
Prospective borrowers can apply for and receive WIFIA loans at nearly any stage of project completion.","On Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the availability of $6.5 billion in Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) funding for water systems, with an additional $550 million available to states. The agency also announced the approval of five WIFIA new loans.

On the available funding, EPA said interested entities can apply through WIFIA’s rolling application process.

The first WIFIA Notice of Funding Availability was issued during President Donald Trump’s first term. This funding represents the 9th round of financing with $6.5 billion available. Through a separate Notice of Funding Availability, $550 million is available to state infrastructure financing authorities through the SWIFIA program. EPA is currently accepting letters of interest for both.

For this new round of funding, EPA said it identified the following as priority areas that will advance it’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative, including:

Ensuring safe drinking water and addressing pollution in our nation’s waterbodies;

Unleashing American energy dominance;

Advancing cooperative federalism by supporting local, regional, and state water priorities;

Supporting innovation in the water sector; and

Promoting economic growth and furthering America’s industrial resurgence.

“EPA’s WIFIA program provides a win-win for communities and American taxpayers,” said EPA’s Assistant Administrator for Water Jessica Kramer. “Communities use these competitive loans to upgrade water infrastructure to benefit residents and businesses while loan payments reimburse the U.S. Treasury.”

New Loans Approved

EPA also announced the following loans have been approved and said it will work with the recipients to formally close loan agreements.

Fort Worth, Texas – A $347 million loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse. A newly designed and built water reclamation facility will meet the needs of a growing population while treating wastewater to be reused for industrial and irrigation purposes.

Pflugerville, Texas – A $176 million WIFIA loan will support multiple projects modernizing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in this growing city. Work will include design and construction of a new wastewater treatment plant, expansion and consolidation of wastewater collection systems, and water main rehabilitation. This is the second WIFIA loan to the City of Pflugerville.

Joliet, Illinois – An $87 million loan will help transition the city’s drinking water supply from a stressed and unsustainable aquifer. Projects will include upgrading the distribution system to reduce water loss as the city prepares to begin using water from Lake Michigan. This is the third WIFIA loan for the City of Joliet under an agreement that will provide a total of $395 million in financing.

Ashland, Oregon – A $73 million WIFIA loan will help build a new drinking water treatment plant to provide a safer and more resilient supply of clean drinking water to this small, rural community.

Wilton Manors, Florida – A $28 million WIFIA loan will reduce the risk of pipeline failures, minimize water loss, and improve system reliability, particularly during emergencies such as storm events. Projects include replacing water mains, rehabilitating and replacing wastewater lift stations and force mains, and improving stormwater drainage systems.

About WIFIA

Established in 2014, the WIFIA program is an EPA-operated bank that provides supplemental, flexible, low-cost credit assistance to public and private borrowers for all types of drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects. WIFIA offers long-term loans that can be combined with State Revolving Fund assistance, municipal bonds, and federal and state grants. They can help communities deliver more critical water infrastructure projects for a lower cost with less impact on rate payers.

Like a bank, the WIFIA program has funding available on an ongoing basis. This allows prospective borrowers to request financing on their schedule. Prospective borrowers can apply for and receive WIFIA loans at nearly any stage of project completion.

Durable, bipartisan congressional majorities have repeatedly endorsed a comprehensive energy strategy that delineates a clear role for the federal government, led by the Department of Energy (DOE), in the research, development, and deployment of innovative energy technologies. In just the last five years, Congress has come together across party lines on three separate occasions to pass landmark energy legislation under presidents of both parties: the Energy Policy Act of 2020, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Together, these laws formed the backbone of an economic strategy that met the moment to deliver affordable, clean, and abundant energy for American consumers and businesses; they also provided the private sector with the resources necessary to compete and win in the competitive international marketplace.

However, the Department of Energy has unilaterally reneged on congressionally mandated spending by cutting federal funds from hundreds of projects. In May, DOE announced the cancellation of 24 awards for clean energy demonstrations – including carbon capture and industrial demonstrations – totaling more than $3.7 billion in awards. Then, in early October, DOE announced the termination of 321 awards for energy projects worth approximately $7.56 billion in obligations, largely impacting states and congressional districts represented by Democrats. Subsequently, it was reported that an even larger DOE cut list – with about 300 additional projects, including many in states and districts represented by Republicans – was circulating on Capitol Hill and among advocates. Although this list was reportedly sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget, the administration has yet to say if it will be moving forward with the additional cancellations, as Republican lawmakers have pushed back.

These announced cuts and additional cuts being considered impact approximately 650 projects, encompassing $23 billion in federal funding, and span a wide array of energy projects that support Trump administration priorities such as reducing electricity costs, supporting cutting-edge technologies like carbon capture and storage, nuclear energy, and next generation geothermal, grid and transmission infrastructure, natural gas technologies, onshoring manufacturing, and industrial innovation. Locally, these cuts will have devastating impacts on communities and private sector businesses, eliminating jobs and economic opportunities.

They would also impact nearly every state across the U.S. Each project represents local jobs and economic development, partnerships, upstream and downstream supply chains with their own private investments, and up to 50% non-federal cost share from project partners. Altogether, the economic impact is far greater than the amount of stated federal investment to be canceled.

In addition to negatively impacting state and local economies today, these cuts threaten energy deployment and long-term energy innovation in a way that hampers U.S. economic competitiveness. For instance, the U.S. government and private sector are squarely focused on the promise of artificial intelligence, a technology that requires significant electricity deployment to power data centers – cuts to solar and wind deployment, as well as grid resiliency, will harm that industry.

Table 2. Total Estimated Announced and Being Considered for Termination Project and Funding Cuts by Key Sector

In addition to negatively impacting state and local economies today, these cuts threaten energy deployment and long-term energy innovation in a way that hampers U.S. economic competitiveness. For instance, the U.S. government and private sector are squarely focused on the promise of artificial intelligence, a technology that requires significant electricity deployment to power data centers – cuts to solar and wind deployment, as well as grid resiliency, will harm that industry. Meanwhile, American manufacturing requires cheap energy and electricity to modernize and reduce input costs; announced cuts and additional cuts being considered threaten existing and future energy supplies for the sector, including low-cost electricity and hydrogen.

Lawmakers must use all available channels of influence to instruct the Department of Energy to reinstate or reissue project awards, and refrain from making future cuts.

The high cost of retreat: What happens when federal commitment to energy innovation falters

Congress has provided strong bipartisan authorizations and appropriations for federal funding programs that advance energy innovation, designating the Department of Energy (DOE) with a key role to support technology advancement from research and development to demonstration and commercialization. The Energy Policy Act of 2020, Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (CHIPS Act), and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) all received bipartisan support and set in place grants and loans to bridge the financing gap that private lenders and companies alone cannot support. This type of federal support is vital to bring more energy solutions to market, boost U.S. competitiveness, and maintain global energy leadership.

In May and early October, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced it was canceling billions of dollars in awards to hundreds of projects funded by this bipartisan legislation, particularly BIL, and recent reporting indicates additional project cuts are likely underway. Cutting these project awards not only violates Congress’ clear direction to DOE to fund energy innovation across a variety of technologies; it undercuts the administration’s stated goal of energy dominance, negatively impacting American businesses and both national and local economies.

DOE’s role and partnership is critical to bridging the financing gap to build domestic energy security and reliability and compete in global markets. Many emerging energy infrastructure technologies face bankability challenges that prevent private investment and stunt technology development. To overcome these challenges, government investment has and will be essential to get these technologies to market.

Withdrawing this federal funding would not only undermine our global leadership in energy, but also negatively impact communities and drive uncertainty across multiple industries of national importance. The effects of withdrawing federal funding – from job loss, local economic development impacts, cascading effects up and down supply chains, and a long-term erosion of trust in bipartisan federal financial incentives – risks the viability of future investments directed by the federal government and threatens local economic prosperity.

DOE announced cuts and additional cuts being considered

DOE issued its Secretarial Policy on Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance in May 2025. This policy establishes the following criteria for reviewing projects: 1) financially sound and economically viable, 2) aligned with national and economic security interests, and 3) consistent with federal law and this administration’s policies and priorities and program goals and priorities. These criteria run counter to the bipartisan legislation directing DOE to bridge the funding gap for innovative energy technologies as these technologies are not yet economically viable for commercial lenders and require DOE support to advance to commercialization. The criteria also run counter to how federal funding is established and executed: Congress passes legislation to direct the policies and funding, which federal agencies must carry out.

DOE proposes to terminate federal investment cost-share in over 650 projects totaling over $23 billion

DOE is now considering pulling billions of congressionally-directed investment from research and development (R&D) to large-scale demonstrations necessary to move technologies toward commercialization. These awarded investments span a variety of cutting-edge energy technologies – including carbon capture and storage, nuclear energy, next-generation geothermal, grid and transmission infrastructure, and natural gas technologies – that support stated administration priorities like reducing electricity costs, onshoring manufacturing, and industrial innovation.

Project awardees potentially impacted include hundreds of U.S.-based companies, organizations, and state and local governments across the country – including auto giants General Motors, Volvo, and Harley Davidson, as well as major oil and gas companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil. Also at risk are projects among the $5+ trillion in new investments touted this year by the White House. For example, GE Vernova announced plans to invest $600 million in U.S. manufacturing over the next two years, creating more than 1,500 new jobs. This includes a $50+ million project to expand gas turbine manufacturing in Schenectady, NY – a project DOE would be walking away from. DOE would also be rescinding federal cost-share from other private sector partners making massive investments in the U.S., including TS Conductor Corporation, Siemens, Schneider Electric, Diageo, FirstEnergy Corp., Westinghouse, General Motors, and Kraft Heinz.

A number of these cost-share investments date back to the first Trump administration and have benefited from years of bipartisan support as they’ve progressed from research and development to pilot and demonstration. DOE would be rescinding its share of investment in a number of first-of-a-kind pilot and demonstration projects before they get the real bang for their buck, which comes from shepherding technology advancements to commercialization and enabling private sector deployment. That is the return on investment that Congress directed and that American taxpayers benefit from. Millions, if not billions, of previous federal investments that supported these projects in earlier R&D project stages could be wasted if DOE walks away from project partners that are finally at the demonstration stage.

This move, along with its lack of transparency, risks the integrity of DOE’s longstanding project development pipeline.

The impacts of announced cuts and additional cuts being considered

Announced cuts and additional cuts being considered would impact nearly every state across the U.S. Each project represents local jobs and economic development, partnerships, upstream and downstream supply chains with their own private investments, and up to 50% non-federal cost share from project partners. Altogether, the economic impact is far greater than the amount of stated federal investment to be canceled.

The most-impacted states2 by federal investments (combining announced cuts and additional cuts being considered) include:

California — $3.6 billion

Texas — $1.6 billion

Illinois —$1.1 billion

Indiana — $854 million

Michigan —$846 million

Louisiana — $705 million

Colorado — $653 million

Georgia — $624 million

North Carolina — $591 million

Minnesota — $555 million

From projects to cut emissions from the industrial and transportation sectors to projects that would reduce methane emissions and air pollution, the impacts of DOE cuts touch a wide range of projects that propel American innovation and competitiveness.

Industrial Innovation

U.S. manufacturing, including heavy industrial sectors, is essential for economic security – and innovation in these sectors is critical to enabling future growth of U.S. manufacturing on a global scale.

U.S. manufacturing directly employs more than 12.8 million workers3 and for every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, there is an approximate 264% return in cumulative impact to the overall U.S. economy.4 Industrial sectors like the U.S. chemical manufacturing and petroleum refining sectors contribute ~8%5 of U.S. GDP and are exposed to global trade dynamics, making up 9% of U.S. exports.6 Goods with lower carbon intensities are best positioned to win future market share for manufacturers with an export-oriented market, as many foreign markets develop mechanisms to explicitly account for carbon intensity of imported goods.7

Innovative industrial demonstration projects supported by the federal government are a foundation for future private sector investment, as follow-on projects will be less risky and costly for the private sector. Demonstration projects are essential for validating innovative technologies’ operational and commercial viability at scale. Large complex infrastructure projects, such as carbon capture projects, typically require two to six commercial-scale demonstrations of the technology to prove their effectiveness and reduce cost through a process known as “learning by doing.”8 Industrial demonstration projects drive innovations in production processes, heat delivery, alternative fuels and feedstocks including hydrogen, carbon management, and product recycling. These innovations will lead to reductions in capital and operating costs. They will also increase U.S. industrial technology export competitiveness, leading to cutting edge technologies being licensed abroad bringing benefits to U.S. companies.

U.S. companies want to innovate and reduce their emissions in partnership with DOE, as exemplified by the overwhelming interest in DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP), which was 10 times oversubscribed. Through the IDP, DOE received over 400 concept papers from U.S. companies requesting over $60B in federal funding matched with ~$100B in private cost share. The application and negotiations process resulted in 33 first-of-a-kind projects across 20+ states with $6B in federal funding, matched by $14B in private cost share.9

The announced and additional considered cuts to the IDP include 21 projects with ~$3.5B of obligated federal cost share across multiple sectors and technologies. These indiscriminate cancellations undermine the intent of the IDP to increase manufacturing competitiveness, increase U.S. industrial technology export competitiveness, achieve emissions reduction in industrial sectors, and build shared prosperity for American workers and communities through job creation and local partnerships. The cuts to the Mitchell Cement Plant Decarbonization Project are an especially detrimental example of the lapse of federal-private relationships, as the DOE has been working closely with the Indiana facility.10 The latest award was the fourth related to this project, which has a history of DOE funding since at least 2022.11 U.S. cement plants will have trouble meeting net-zero without CCS due to their process emissions, and the Mitchell project was a prime example of one facility leading the charge. Other proposed project cancellations, such as Dow’s $95M award to capture by-product CO2 from their ethylene oxide operations in Freeport, Texas to produce electrolyte solvents was aimed to strengthen the domestic battery supply chain and reduce reliance on China.12 Canceling these projects hurts America’s ability to compete on a global scale.

Additional industrial-focused DOE-funded projects outside of the IDP were also impacted by the recent funding cuts. These include projects from the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) like the testing of a novel carbon capture technology on blast furnace gas at U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thompson Works in Pennsylvania, a facility that the federal government has a vested interest in through its “Golden Share.”13

Businesses also require a level of certainty throughout the entire project development process, from project conception to final investment decision, construction, and startup. Because DOE is now canceling previously awarded projects, the private sector may be less willing to participate in future federal partnership opportunities to achieve any administration’s goals, given a perception of increased political risk.

Carbon Management

U.S. investment in CCS and DAC commercial pilots and demonstrations is essential for maintaining national competitiveness in export markets as global demand for low-carbon products grows. Other countries, including China, Canada, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and members of the European Union, are making major investments in DAC, CCS, and carbon utilization to secure advantages in low-carbon trade. Limited federal investment can help bring new CCUS applications to market by reducing risk for first-of-a-kind projects that would not otherwise advance. Public-private partnerships for commercial pilots and demonstrations are therefore critical for building investor confidence and creating market conditions where follow-on projects can attract private capital without federal support. Recent bipartisan funding decisions have placed the United States on a path to lead in these technologies and in related economic and workforce development. Reducing these investments now would unnecessarily jeopardize that progress.

In recent years, federally funded research and investment have helped launch a new wave of carbon management pilots and demonstrations in key industrial sectors, including refining, chemicals, steam methane reforming, steel, and cement. These projects can accelerate the wider deployment of commercial CCS, particularly in export-oriented states such as Louisiana and Texas and drive new investment and job creation. To date, more than 270 publicly announced carbon management projects across the country represent more than $77.5 billion in capital expenditure. For these commercial investments to succeed and continue generating economic benefits, including from demand for low-emission industrial products abroad, the United States should prioritize the funding already committed to major pilot and demonstration projects.

Federal investment in CarbonSAFE projects derisks carbon management for private sector investment by performing the complex and costly work of characterizing storage reservoirs, analyzing core and seismic data, and preparing Class VI applications. Because carbon capture and storage operate as a three-part value chain consisting of capture, transport, and storage, the sector faces a chicken-and-egg problem in which none of these links can function without the others. Building out storage capacity first is the key step that allows the rest of the system to scale. DOE’s announced cuts and additional cuts being considered to several CarbonSAFE and storage-focused grant awards weakens the foundation for large-scale carbon management in the United States. Most of the affected projects were in regions that are essential for deployment, including in Louisiana, where four projects were cut, the Southeast, where an additional four projects were canceled, and the Illinois Basin.

The latest project cuts could set back innovation across several novel and emerging industries that the United States has pioneered, such as DAC. Carbon removal is a growing global industry; without federal support, project developers will deploy first-of-a-kind projects in other countries. In fact, U.S.-based startup Carbon Capture Inc. has already decided to relocate the company’s first commercial DAC pilot project from Arizona to Canada due to better incentives and a more stable regulatory environment. The project is expected to go online by the end of October, and at full capacity, it will be Canada’s biggest operating system of its kind.

One of the funding cuts is for a DAC hub powered by next-generation geothermal energy. Next-generation geothermal is an exciting new technology with enormous potential to meet growing U.S. energy demand, including for DAC. Canceling this project would hamper the rollout of DAC as well as the rollout of next-generation geothermal. According to the Carbon Business Council, rolling back U.S. investment in DAC Hubs puts 130,000+ jobs at risk, billions lost, and idle factories, while other countries seize the industry leadership opportunity.

Despite the administration’s stated priorities on coal and natural gas, these rollbacks include promised investments in carbon capture technology that would improve local air quality during the operation of coal and natural gas resources. Funding cuts include coal-sector demonstrations, FEED studies, pilots, and a planned CO2 trunkline, wiping out U.S. innovation testbeds for integrated capture, transport, and storage on coal flue gas. These include the large-scale pilot and integrated FEED at Wyoming’s Dry Fork Station, a FEED study at the Four Corners Generation plant in Navajo Nation, funding for Wyoming’s Integrated Test Center, a test-bed for carbon capture innovation, the Edwardsport IGCC FEED in Indiana, and regional CO2 trunkline planning Trail of the Chiefs, which would have connected multiple emitters in Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming to geologic storage sites. The additional cuts being considered also include DOE funding for Project Tundra, a major retrofit at the Milton R. Young station. The Wyoming funding cut is notable because the state legislature has also maintained its coal carbon‑capture mandate, enacted in 2020 as HB0200.

Cutting these U.S. demonstrations and pilots may push capture developers to validate equipment abroad, like at the test center in Mongstad Norway, rather than at U.S. facilities with American workers and operating under U.S. conditions.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen is a necessary input for many essential industrial processes, including crude oil refining, clean steel manufacturing, and fertilizer production. It also has important applications as a feedstock and/or fuel in aviation and marine shipping. Catalyzing the hydrogen industry promotes domestic energy security, independence, and reliability via an all-of-the-above approach to energy production and development. Federal funding incentivizes domestic hydrogen production, innovation, and delivery from a variety of sources, including nuclear energy, renewable power, and natural gas with carbon capture. Promoting hydrogen production maintains the U.S. as a global market leader, especially while other countries are increasingly seeking new energy sources. Moreover, the U.S. can lean on existing infrastructure like pipelines that are already built out in the Gulf Coast. The U.S. is on its way to a self-sufficient hydrogen industry which will strengthen the economy and create good-paying jobs, but more investment is needed to continue to spur innovation.

The announced cuts and additional considered cuts destabilize the burgeoning hydrogen economy. The proposed cuts include eliminating all of the awards by the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program as well as 76 other hydrogen projects that support the buildout of a domestic hydrogen industry. These projects represent over $821 million of obligated federal funding for: hydrogen production pathway research and scaling; fuel cell technology innovation; hydrogen storage, transport, and infrastructure; hydrogen vehicles and mobility applications; and industrial hydrogen use and decarbonization. The DOE cuts threaten to stall the momentum needed to build a competitive, self-sustaining domestic hydrogen industry. These projects are critical to advancing technology readiness, commercialization, and workforce development across the entire hydrogen value chain. Their funding cuts would significantly undercut progress in decreasing costs, accelerating market deployment, and building a skilled workforce – precisely what is needed to attract private capital and build market confidence. Sectors such as steel, refining, chemicals, and heavy-duty transportation stand to be most affected: without continued public investment, these hard-to-abate sectors lose near-term decarbonization opportunities made possible using hydrogen.

A full cancellation of the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program would rescind almost $7B of federal funding from innovative clean energy projects, jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of private investment nationwide. The hubs program was a bipartisan initiative passed in a bipartisan law; cutting the support now would be antithetical to the administration’s stated goals to bolster domestic energy production and American competitiveness and would undermine the development of the domestic hydrogen industry. The U.S. will risk its leadership position on the global stage, both in terms of exporting a variety of transportation fuels that rely on hydrogen as a feedstock and ceding leadership in technological development as other countries continue to fund and make progress on a variety of hydrogen production pathways and end uses.

Methane Pollution Reduction

The oil and gas sector is the largest anthropogenic source of methane emissions in the U.S. Federal financial and technical assistance for methane pollution reduction prevents loss of valuable energy resources, decreases human and ecosystem exposure to harmful pollutants, strengthens industry competitiveness in the global market, and creates good jobs.

Announced and additional considered cuts include awards to projects that were selected as part of the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP). Through MERP, Congress authorized DOE and EPA to leverage their joint expertise in advancing methane mitigation technologies by providing financial and technical assistance to help oil and natural gas operators implement cost-effective solutions to implement innovative methane emissions reduction technologies. These funded projects would have spurred innovation in the U.S. methane mitigation sector while creating jobs and reducing emissions of methane and other air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants like benzene from the oil and gas sector. The projects would have also reduced emissions from oil and natural gas infrastructure in or near overburdened communities where people live, work, and go to school, creating clear air quality benefits for those communities and the industry alike.

Other methane-related projects that were cut pre-date MERP and were already partially funded. These are ongoing projects, and many are midway through data collection and analysis. These projects supported technology and inventory development to understand methane emission sources and mitigation opportunities while also creating jobs. The funding cuts threaten all these benefits, creating uncertainty for both the communities surrounding oil and gas development and the industry itself at a time when companies are asking for more certainty.

Near-Term Energy Infrastructure

DOE’s investments in solar, wind, and grid upgrades, and associated community engagement, community benefits, and workforce programs, are a key component to promoting affordability, resilience, and reduced pollution in the near term, and to spurring innovation that will pay future dividends. Announced cuts and additional cuts being considered in each of those areas will harm communities and the environment and reduce future American competitiveness.

Solar and Wind

Federal investment in solar energy has reduced energy costs for consumers and enhanced American economic competitiveness: as DOE itself notes, without DOE’s involvement, the average solar photovoltaic (PV) module production cost per watt would have been $5.27 in 2008 rather than $1.92. Solar’s affordability-in large part a product of targeted federal investment-contributes to the technology’s decade-long installation growth.

The next generation of solar innovation funding awards announced cuts and additional cuts being considered includes many instances of research, development, and deployment that would have continued to drive down the cost of solar energy and support domestic manufacturing, including awards of nearly $3 million to Silfab Solar Cells’ Washington production facility to scale a new high-performance silicon module technology; nearly $5 million to Silfab Solar Cells’ South Carolina production facility to demonstrate efficiencies in next-generation solar cells; and $6.4 million to Swift Solar to improve efficiencies in different climate zones. Funding for wind technology innovation was also hard-hit, with commensurate consequences for energy affordability, American manufacturing and economic competitiveness. Multiple million-dollar-plus investments in agrivoltaics-the dual use of solar generation and agriculture, which can provide an important revenue stream for farmers while reducing solar land use requirements-have also been cut or are reportedly at risk of being cut by DOE.

DOE’s announced cuts and additional considered cuts include funding to projects to improve community engagement, investigate community benefits mechanisms, and evaluate solar siting practices-all essential avenues to deploying energy infrastructure in communities across the country. These projects included $2.3 million awarded to the Solar & Storage Industries Institute to research community acceptance of large-scale solar projects, nearly $2 million awarded to Princeton University to reimagine community benefits mechanisms for large-scale solar projects with an eye toward promoting community-driven and equitable benefits, and nearly $2.5 million awarded to the University of Pennsylvania to gain insights into the drivers of community support or opposition. CATF’s research has found that community engagement, when done well, can build lasting relationships, reduce permitting timelines and litigation risk, and ensure that projects deliver real benefits to the people most affected by them. This research into how developers and communities work productively together to achieve positive outcomes is an essential component of energy deployment.

Grid Resiliency

A stronger, more resilient grid is a precursor for the next chapter of American economic growth. As new demand sources, including data centers for artificial intelligence, come online and new energy sources are deployed to meet that load growth, targeted federal investment can deliver high returns on investment. Deployment of grid modernization technologies, rebuilding and reconductoring lines to enhance capacity, and other direct grid infrastructure upgrades will improve reliability, maximize existing assets, and improve affordability while reducing the need to build greenfield infrastructure. These efforts can quickly and cost-effectively create additional grid capacity and interconnect new resources to locations served by existing infrastructure, particularly when more interconnection capacity will be needed to serve projected load increases in the near term. Deployment of grid modernization technologies, rebuilding and reconductoring lines to enhance capacity, and other direct grid infrastructure upgrades will improve reliability, maximize existing assets, and improve affordability while reducing the need to build greenfield infrastructure. These efforts can quickly and cost-effectively create additional grid capacity and interconnect new resources to locations served by existing infrastructure, particularly when more interconnection capacity will be needed to serve projected load increases in the near term.

DOE’s announced and additional considered cuts to grid related investments directly reduce efforts that would strengthen grid reliability, efficiency, and resiliency. For example, cuts include a $50 million grant to Minnesota Power to modernize its high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system to meet future energy needs while increasing the reliability and resilience of the regional grid. GDO’s cuts included investments in a number of programs that would develop advanced management for distributed energy resources (DERs) such as energy storage, solar systems, and chargers. These distributed and demand-side resources can be some of the most cost-effective and quickly deployed resources that provide both energy and capacity to maintain resource adequacy and other grid services. The benefits of DERs, aggregated into a Virtual Power Plant (VPP), have been demonstrated in several studies, including the Department of Energy’s VPP Liftoff report, which estimates that 30-60 GW of VPP capacity operated on the grid in 2023. Additionally, according to a recent Brattle report, the cost-effective load flexibility potential in New York is estimated to reach 3 GW by 2030, or 11% of the New York power system’s summer peak.

Microgrids and energy resilience hubs can provide significant grid reliability and resilience benefits to communities whole, especially during periods of grid disruption from severe weather or disasters. The primary purpose of many of the DOE projects was to improve resilience to extreme weather events, including for rural and remote communities. Among the cuts was a $17.3 million grant to Jamestown, NY, for a microgrid system that would ensure energy is delivered to public services, the hospital, designated emergency shelters, schools, and other businesses. These projects are intended to decrease risk of blackouts and brownouts and contribute to grid stability. Microgrids can also be designed to strengthen grid reliability and resilience through smart grid technologies.

Grid Planning

Well-planned transmission that more broadly supports connecting low-cost generation resources with load centers can reduce rates and improve affordability, reduce grid congestion and improve system efficiency, and build connections between regions that allow electricity to be transmitted during emergencies. Unfortunately, our national grid today is disjointed with multiple regional operators and transmission planning that is solely conducted at state and regional levels. While states and regions are often eager to collaborate with each other and explore these opportunities, collective action problems and differences in governance between states and regions can hinder much-needed progress in connecting our grid. Federal investment can provide the resources necessary to support cooperation, planning, and coordination across regions to help overcome these challenges. Yet, funding to projects that support regional planning and deployment, such as the Minnesota Commerce Department/JTIQ project, are among those announced cuts and additional cuts being considered by DOE. Cancellation of awards to support collaborative grid projects not only hinders the development of lines identified proactively between regions but also disincentivizes further regional collaboration efforts. Cancellations like this only serve to maintain a grid unprepared to address the demands of the 21st century.

Transportation

DOE’s transportation-related programs are central to reducing air pollution and decarbonizing the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The recent $3 billion in funding cuts to innovative transportation projects would jeopardize progress across a broad portfolio of investments that accelerate zero-emission mobility, including producing low-carbon fuels, building EV charging and freight corridors, electrifying heavy-duty and public transit fleets, modernizing ports and airports, and training the skilled workforce needed to deploy these systems. In addition to bolstering domestic transportation infrastructure, these investments would underpin U.S. innovation capacity and industrial competitiveness in rapidly emerging global markets for clean transportation technologies and fuels. One of the funding projects being targeted would support a John Deere-led effort in Illinois to develop charging systems for zero-emission off-road equipment ($2 million); another would help Blue Bird retool an existing factory in Georgia to produce zero-emission school buses ($80 million); and another would support converting a GM vehicle assembly facility in Michigan for EV production ($500 million).

The list of considered cuts also includes the Orsted Star e-Methanol project ($99 million) in Texas and the M2X Energy low-carbon methanol project ($6 million) in North Dakota, both aimed at producing clean methanol for marine fuel to decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate segments of global transport. These initiatives are critical for demonstrating scalable, low-carbon liquid fuel pathways that can displace fossil bunker fuel and strengthen U.S. leadership in the modernization and decarbonization of the maritime industry, a sector where international regulations and private shipping commitments are already driving rapid change. Defunding such projects would not only slow technological progress but also erode investor confidence and cede competitive ground to other nations investing heavily in low-carbon fuel innovation. By halting demonstration and deployment efforts just as they begin to scale, these cuts would delay near-term emissions reductions, weaken domestic supply chains that are poised to become globally competitive, and risk fragmenting regional planning efforts essential to long-term energy and economic security.

Conclusion

DOE’s role in energy innovation is necessary to bridge the financing gap for innovative energy technologies. Existing investments add to U.S. energy security and global competitiveness while adding billions of economic investment across the country, supporting local supply chains, jobs, and communities. These investments also represent bipartisan demand for the deployment of innovative energy technologies, which will support many American industries, including industrial manufacturing, power, and transportation.

Industries need certainty in federal investments if they are to expend the private costs necessary to bring more energy options to market. Canceling DOE’s financial commitments to these projects would inject more market uncertainty while going against congressional direction and the administration’s priorities to enhance energy reliability and security. DOE should maintain its existing commitments.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/21092116/EnergyTransmission_HeroFeature_1b.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:00.159121

Mark Messmer (R-IN) joined Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, and other Members of Congress, at an agency announcement clarifying what constitutes a ‘water of the United States’ under the Clean Water Act.

Up until now, landowners, developers, and farmers, have been forced to operate in an environment marked by burdensome federal overreach. The EPA’s proposed rule gives Americans much needed certainty.

Read Rep. Messmer’s full remarks at the rule unveiling here:

“Good morning to everyone here today and thank you Administrator Zeldin for extending the invitation to participate in today’s ground-breaking announcement.

“The lack of clarity around “waters of the United States” has plagued American homeowners, farmers, and developers for decades.

“Instead of working to improve the quality of our lakes, rivers, and wetlands, this failed regulatory language has hamstrung backyards across America in regulatory confusion.

“Under the WOTUS obscurity, Hoosier farmers working their lands and families renovating their homes have been served fines and court dates their actions never warranted.

“Conservationists, producers, and residents across Indiana’s 8th Congressional District are experts in managing their local resources.

“These local leaders, especially in our beautiful state of Indiana, know how to protect our environment best.

“And after working for several years in the Indiana legislature on state WOTUS regulations, I know how desperately in need of reform this policy is.

“Today’s announcement concludes an era marked by overregulation and deference to faceless bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.

“I applaud Administrator Zeldin and the Trump administration for their efforts to gather commentary from stakeholders across the nation, including Hoosier leaders.

“This is precisely how federal regulations should be developed.

“By leveraging the time-tried expertise of those impacted by “WOTUS” failures, EPA has reached a robust definition and a just framework that finally offers landowners the clarity they deserve.

“I look forward to a continued partnership with President Trump and Administrator Zeldin as we roll out policies that reflect the insight of the American people and reform regulations that have handcuffed our communities for far too long.

“Thank you.

“God bless Indiana, and God bless America.”

Last year, the number of jobs in North Carolina’s economy grew by about 1%. But growth in clean energy employment outpaced other sectors, according to a new report.

The advocacy group E2 found that clean energy jobs grew by about 3% in 2024. That includes jobs that make new clean energy, as well as put that energy to work or use energy more efficiently.

“Another year of data demonstrating that clean energy is a really powerful engine for job growth in North Carolina,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast advocate.

He said growth trends were largely in line with what past reports have shown. North Carolina remains in the top 10 for most clean energy jobs in the country, with businesses employing around 113,000 workers. For context, that’s significantly more than the number of teachers, and includes about 15% of total construction jobs in the state, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mecklenburg and Wake counties made the top 30 list of counties with the most jobs across these sectors.

Within the broad category of “clean energy,” the energy efficiency sector employs significantly more workers than any other. That includes HVAC technicians, lighting experts and other jobs that either electrify the home or make it consume energy more efficiently. The state has continued investing in this workforce into 2025, announcing the Energy Saver NC program in January, which gives homeowners up to $16,000 back on home electrification and efficiency projects.

The clean vehicle sector halted its upward trajectory last year, mirroring the national decline in automotive manufacturing jobs during the last couple of years.

“This year, we actually saw a slight reduction in that workforce,” Amittay said. The sector shrank 2.5%, even as North Carolina’s EV supply chain continues to develop. When combined with new EV battery manufacturing, such as the $14 billion Toyota battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, N.C., the state remains in the top four nationally for investments in manufacturing EVs and batteries.

Amittay said the Inflation Reduction Act and its associated tax credits drove much of the growth that year. “Plenty of this growth would have happened regardless of the policy landscape.”

“Renewable generation continues to be a notch above the economy statewide,” he said. “What’s really kind of head and shoulders above statewide growth is storage and grid.”

That includes folks such as Charlotte-based Heimdall Power’s president, Brita Formato, who presented about her new powerline “neuron” during an E2 event last week in Charlotte. The device provides real-time data to utilities about their transmission line capacity:

“Using the infrastructure that we already have will bridge us to that 7-10 years that we need to build out the grid,” Formato said. In addition to new clean energy jobs, technologies like Heimdall Power’s neuron are lowering electricity bills.

Looking ahead, Amittay said he expects growth to continue, albeit more slowly.

“What we’re doing is leaving some potential for jobs on the table,” said Amittay, referring to changes in federal policy during the last year. President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill eliminated or greatly restricted federal incentives for solar installations and manufacturing.

This new political landscape has made renewable energy businesses in particular more sensitive to state and local changes. During this past legislative session, lawmakers removed a key carbon pollution reduction target and took aim at a tax abatement for utility-scale solar projects. Meanwhile, other initiatives, such as Duke Energy’s PowerPair and Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, have helped buoy rooftop solar sales into the first quarter of 2026.

The initiative was developed in partnership with the International Sanitary Supply Association (ISSA), whose standards and expertise have shaped the program’s curriculum and training framework. Students completing the two-semester program will receive industry-recognized, ISSA-endorsed Basic Certified Cleaning Technician and Advanced Certified Cleaning Technician credentials, demonstrating their knowledge of cleaning standards, best practices, and protocols.

Nunez recently received a $54,000 donation from the Port of New Orleans (Port NOLA), HDR, Inc., Evans-Graves Engineers, Inc., and the Advocacy Partners to support the implementation of the program. The generous donation will help fund curriculum development, instructional materials, and facility enhancements that will allow the college to provide high-quality, industry-aligned training.

“The Environmental Services Technician program represents an important expansion of our workforce mission,” said Dr. Tina Tinney, Chancellor of Nunez Community College. “Through the generosity of Port NOLA, HDR, Evans-Graves, and the Advocacy Partners, as well as with the expertise of ISSA, this unique program offers a pathway not only to employment, but to purpose. It prepares our region’s students for impactful employment while driving economic prosperity and community well-being.”

Uplifting Underserved Students

Nationwide, the unemployment rate for individuals with a disability was twice that of those with no disability in 2024 (U.S. Department of Labor). In an effort to close that gap locally, the Environmental Services Technician program will serve as a bridge to opportunity for special education students in St. Bernard Parish Public Schools, providing hands-on experience and employable skills.

The first cohort of Environmental Services Technician students consists of dual-enrolled, special education students from Chalmette High School. Upon graduation, these students will be prepared to work in environmental services departments across healthcare, education, and commercial facilities.

Students will complete internships with several area employers, including the Royal Sonesta Hotel, the Balcony Ballroom, the Louisiana Children’s Museum, B&G Grocery, Coffee House—Arabi, the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff’s Office, and the St. Bernard Parish Government Complex.

“Port NOLA is proud to partner with Nunez on a program that expands access to meaningful careers while strengthening our region’s workforce,” said Beth Branch, Port NOLA President & CEO and NOPB CEO. “This collaboration demonstrates the power of education and industry working together to create real pathways to employment, independence, and long-term success.”

Last year, the number of jobs in North Carolina’s economy grew by about 1%. But growth in clean energy employment outpaced other sectors, according to a new report.

The advocacy group E2 found that clean energy jobs grew by about 3% in 2024. That includes jobs that make new clean energy, as well as put that energy to work or use energy more efficiently.

“Another year of data demonstrating that clean energy is a really powerful engine for job growth in North Carolina,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast advocate.

He said growth trends were largely in line with what past reports have shown. North Carolina remains in the top 10 for most clean energy jobs in the country, with businesses employing around 113,000 workers. For context, that’s significantly more than the number of teachers, and includes about 15% of total construction jobs in the state, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mecklenburg and Wake counties made the top 30 list of counties with the most jobs across these sectors.

Within the broad category of “clean energy,” the energy efficiency sector employs significantly more workers than any other. That includes HVAC technicians, lighting experts and other jobs that either electrify the home or make it consume energy more efficiently. The state has continued investing in this workforce into 2025, announcing the Energy Saver NC program in January, which gives homeowners up to $16,000 back on home electrification and efficiency projects.

The clean vehicle sector halted its upward trajectory last year, mirroring the national decline in automotive manufacturing jobs during the last couple of years.

“This year, we actually saw a slight reduction in that workforce,” Amittay said. The sector shrank 2.5%, even as North Carolina’s EV supply chain continues to develop.

The battery maker has formulated a preliminary plan to restart its Jianxiawo mine by early December, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. The company has asked suppliers and partners to ready equipment, chemicals and workers, they said, as well as notifying the refiners that draw feedstock from the mine.

CATL’s preparations aren’t a guarantee that the mine will get regulatory approval. The people said the company’s schedule could be subject to change, and that they’re still awaiting sign-off from the authorities.

CATL didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments. Calls to the natural resources departments of both Yichun city and Jiangxi province, where the mine is situated, went unanswered.

The fate of Jianxiawo, owned by the world’s biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, has fixated the industry in recent months. Production at the mine was suspended in August after CATL failed to get an extension on an expired permit.

The mine is expected to account for about 3% of global lithium production. The supply uncertainty, at a time of tighter government scrutiny of the sector, has fueled heightened volatility in prices of the battery metal. Earlier this month, CATL was told how much it should pay for the mining rights, a crucial step in the process that would allow Jianxiawo to restart.

The lithium industry has struggled with a global glut, exacerbated by slowing demand for EVs, although prices have been boosted in recent weeks as the market becomes more confident in demand prospects from the energy storage sector.

The most-active lithium carbonate contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange has jumped over 10% this month, topping 100,000 yuan ($14,000) a ton earlier this week. Bullish sentiment intensified after Ganfeng Lithium Group Co.’s chairman predicted prices could reach as much as 200,000 yuan next year, if demand grows more than 30%.

New York, N.Y. - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin shared 100 additional environmental accomplishments EPA has achieved in the last 100 days, recognizing 300 days of fulfilling the agency’s statutory obligations, and delivering clean air, land, and water for all Americans under President Donald Trump's leadership.

This progress includes announcing a proposed rule today that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of ""pressure testing"" Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

These 100 actions build on Administrator Zeldin’s list of 100 pro-environmental actions taken by the agency during President Trump’s First 100 Days in office and another 100 pro-environmental actions highlighted at the 200-day milestone to total 300 featured accomplishments.

""We are thrilled to announce another 100 top accomplishments from the last 100 days in our mission to meet our statutory duties and defend human health and environmental quality,"" said EPA Administrator Zeldin. ""The Trump EPA is showing that we can be exceptional environmental stewards while Powering the Great American Comeback. 300 days, 300 major environmental wins – this is the energy that propels us forward and the pace that motivates us. We will keep working tirelessly to secure success after success for America's environment and families nationwide.""

This snapshot represents the great work done by the agency on a daily basis as EPA continues to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while committing to commonsense policies that drive down prices, unleash American energy, advance permitting reform and cooperative federalism, make America the AI capital of the world, and revitalize the auto industry.

Toyota’s North Carolina battery plant is open for business. On November 12, Toyota began production at its first battery factory outside Japan: a USD14 billion, 1,850 acre complex in Liberty, North Carolina, expected to create up to 5,100 jobs and supply batteries for both hybrid and fully electric vehicles. Toyota stated that, beginning in 2026, it will shift production of the Toyota RAV4s to 100-percent hybrid, and it expects plug-in hybrid vehicles to make up 20 percent of its overall US production. The company also announced an additional USD10 billion investment in its US operations over the next five years.

Ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles commit to developing zero-emissions infrastructure. On November 10, the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners unanimously approved a binding cooperative agreement with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the Port of Los Angeles that sets enforceable deadlines for developing zero-emission infrastructure across the nation’s busiest port complex. The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, known as the San Pedro Port Complex, handle 40 percent of all container cargo entering the US and, according to the Los Angeles Times, are the single largest source of smog-forming pollution in Southern California, releasing more emissions than the region’s six million cars each day. Approved by SCAQMD on November 7, the framework includes substantial enforcement provisions, with penalties ranging from USD50,000 to USD200,000 per violation. Those funds will be directed toward projects benefiting communities near the ports. The agreement outlines a phased approach to achieving zero-emission operations, covering multiple equipment types by May 2027, with finalized plans for all categories to be in place by the end of 2029. These commitments build on the Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP), a collaboration between the ports that since 2005 has guided them to reduce their emissions of diesel particulate matter by 90 percent, nitrogen oxides by 68 percent, and sulfur oxides by 98 percent.

North American manufacturers cut orders of raw materials amid weak supply chain conditions. Manufacturers in North America significantly reduced their purchases of raw materials and intermediate goods in October, according to the latest data from the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index. The Index registered at -0.33 globally in October, showing that supply chain capacity is not being fully utilized. In North America, the Index fell to its lowest level since March: -0.45. This decline reportedly suggests a possible slowdown in production within North America, reflecting a global environment characterized by underutilized supply chains. Chinese factories are also reducing input buying, the Index reported, increasing spare capacity across Asia’s suppliers. Based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses worldwide, the Volatility Index tracks demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs. The next release of the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index will be in December.

Navigating US congressional inquiries: Key considerations for non-US companies. United States congressional inquiries have become an important instrument to shape policy agendas, test industry practices, influence public opinion, and apply pressure on industries and companies seen as politically relevant. Non-US companies can face unexpected obstacles in these matters due to a number of factors, including cross-border considerations, conflicting laws, and cultural differences. Our alert looks at practical challenges non-US companies may face in congressional inquiries and provides strategic considerations.

US releases 2025 list of critical minerals, adding ten new ones. On October 7, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published the final 2025 List of Critical Minerals in the Federal Register, adding ten new minerals to expand the 2022 list to 60 commodities. The new entries are boron, copper, lead, metallurgical coal, phosphate, potash, rhenium, silicon, silver, and uranium. These minerals were added to address supply chain vulnerabilities for industries like electronics, steelmaking, agriculture, renewable energy, nuclear power, and national defense. Last year, the US imported 80 percent of the rare earth elements it used. The expansion of the list reflects a strategic effort to bolster domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign sources for minerals essential to national security and the economy. Designating critical minerals unlocks expedited federal permitting under FAST-41, Defense Production Act funding, tax incentives, and streamlined reviews, potentially accelerating projects. The Department of Interior can also provide expedited permitting procedures for critical mineral projects.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dlapiperukl0cbf-dlapiperba5d-devd44d-3fa6/media/project/dlapiper-tenant/dlapiper/brand-images/dla-piper-og-image-default-logo.jpg?h=1302&iar=0&w=2500,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:54.573645

Like Musk’s award, Rivian’s plan hinges on a series of highly ambitious performance targets over the next decade, including lifting Rivian’s stock price to $140 (it currently trades around $15). In a softening EV market, and without the financial momentum or investor fervor that once buoyed Tesla, those targets appear particularly steep.

In an SEC filing, Rivian’s board said the package is designed to retain Scaringe as the company enters a “critical next phase” and prepares to launch production of its new electric SUV, the R2. The compensation plan doubles his annual base salary from $1 million to $2 million and gives him the right to buy up to 22 million shares across 11 tranches if Rivian’s stock hits specific price milestones. Scaringe can acquire an additional 14.5 million shares if Rivian meets profit and cash-flow targets before 2032. He can exercise his first tranche at $40 per share. Scaringe currently owns about 1 percent of Rivian. If the plan vests fully, he could add roughly 3 percent more.

Unlike Musk’s plan, Scaringe’s award does not require a shareholder vote, because it was issued under an already approved 2021 incentive program. Rivian’s board ultimately deemed the original performance goals as unrealistic, including a target that envisioned the stock hitting $295.

The Tesla story is hard to replicate

Much of Scaringe’s windfall hinges on the success of the new $45,000 R2 SUV and the smaller R3, which is expected to be priced in the mid-$30,000 range and has already generated significant consumer interest.

Rivian faces a very different landscape than Tesla did during its early ascent. Tesla benefited from low interest rates, abundant capital, and an early-adopter boom in EV enthusiasm. Musk also rode a wave of unique tailwinds—from meme-stock mania to rapid early profitability and a cult-like following—that helped him meet some of the lofty targets in his famously controversial 2018 pay package.

And a successful EV business is far from enough. Since reaching profitability in 2019, Tesla’s high stock price has been increasingly buoyed by optimism on its non-vehicle products, such as software and robotics.

Rivian’s non-EV prospect is less clear and appears to be reliant on external partnerships. Earlier this year, the company formed a joint venture with Volkswagen Group to develop a scalable “software-defined vehicle” architecture, with winter testing of a reference vehicle planned for early 2026. This technology underpins the upcoming R2 and R3 lines, which Rivian hopes will move the company into more affordable, higher-volume segments.",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2059192530.jpg?quality=80,N,,2025-11-21 14:01:39.208434

Bringing data centers to support artificial intelligence online is a top priority for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s newest members, Chair Laura Swett and Commissioner David LaCerte, they said Thursday at their first open meeting since being confirmed.

“In addition to our core mission of keeping the lights on for all Americans at reasonable costs, my priority as chairman is to ensure that our country can connect and power data centers as quickly and as durably as possible,” Swett said.

LaCerte echoed that sentiment.

The AI data race requires “bold action” to protect the economy and national security, he said.

“The risks of inaction or delayed action are simply too great,” he added. “I look forward to partnering with all stakeholders … to accomplish these goals.”

FERC is beginning to consider a proposal from the U.S. Department of Energy for new rules governing the interconnection of data centers and other large loads to the transmission system. State utility regulators earlier this month raised a series of concerns about the proposed rulemaking, including their role in overseeing retail power sales and the potential for data centers to impose costs on other electric retail customers. DOE asked FERC to issue a final rule by April 30.

During FERC’s open meeting, LaCerte said action on data centers must be balanced with maintaining affordable electricity.

“I know that Americans are fearful of higher energy costs due to data center construction and the cost of additional transmission and infrastructure,” LaCerte said. “It’s our duty as commissioners to fully protect these people from undue costs.”

Furthermore, FERC must keep ratepayers in mind in all deliberations, according to LaCerte, who joined FERC from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.

“There are many people in this room, [and] will be in this room during my tenure, looking to curry favor for one project or industry,” he said. “None of these people represent the ratepayer, but we do.”

Also, Lacerte said energy companies shouldn’t face “unnecessary obstacles” that hinder their efforts.

“[National Environmental Policy Act] reviews across the federal government have run off course, failed to protect the environment and often only serve to delay or derail infrastructure projects,” he said.

Swett, a former FERC staffer, said she aims to streamline FERC regulations to bolster energy infrastructure maintenance and construction.

“We are looking into cutting regulatory red tape and increasing transparency in our permitting processes, as well as other FERC processes, to incentivize investment,” she said.

During a media briefing, Swett said she values “legal durability” — the concept that regulations and agency decisions can survive scrutiny in the courts.

Also, Swett stood by FERC’s status as an independent agency.

“Everything that FERC does is independent,” Swett said.

The DOE Organization Act separated FERC from the department’s review powers, Swett said. Those limits, coupled with the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires FERC action to receive stakeholder and commissioner input, ensure the agency’s “independence is safeguarded structurally, and it will continue to be,” Swett said.

Here are four other takeaways from the open meeting.

Winter gas prices expected to jump 26%

FERC staff expect electricity use to be slightly lower this winter than last year, according to the agency’s annual winter outlook report. Peak demand, however, is expected to be 1.6% higher.

While this winter is expected to be warmer than last winter, average natural gas prices are set to rise 26% to $4.39/MMBtu from the previous winter, based on futures prices for the Henry Hub national benchmark on Nov. 4, staff said. Rising demand for natural gas, including from LNG export facilities, is contributing to higher prices at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, staff said. Natural gas fuels more than 40% of U.S. electricity, and gas prices help determine electricity prices.

The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. LNG exports will jump 18.7% to 16.3 Bcf/d on average this winter from a year ago, according to the report.

Meanwhile, drought conditions across the West are expected to cut hydroelectric power production this winter. Drought could also limit operations at power plants that use once-through cooling systems and reduce hydro output in central and southern U.S. regions, according to the report.

FERC considers ‘blanket’ LNG and hydro authorizations

FERC on Thursday launched inquiries to consider creating “blanket” authorizations for certain liquefied natural gas and hydroelectric projects. The commission currently allows pipeline operators to conduct certain activities without getting project-specific authorizations.

“We’re finding ways to simplify and optimize permitting to instill confidence in the promise of building for our future,” Swett said.

Earlier this year, FERC Commissioner Lindsay See pushed for LNG blanket authorizations.

“It’s the right time for us to be thinking through carefully how we can best do our job to ensure facility changes meet our statutory protections while moving forward with appropriate speed and administrative efficiency, especially as so many [LNG] facilities in our country are reaching operational stages,” See said at the open meeting.

The agency closes stagnant dockets

FERC closed four dockets involving “duty of candor” requirements; affiliate conduct standards for liquid pipelines; safe harbor policy on natural gas and electric price indices; and tariff waivers.

The long-dormant dockets have “shrouded the industry with ambiguity,” Swett said.

It’s important that FERC declutters its dockets, according to LaCerte.

“While these ideas and concepts may eventually return, they serve no good looming in purgatory for years on end,” he said.

FERC enforcement levels dip

The commission approved 11 enforcement office settlement agreements totaling $36.6 million in fiscal year 2025 compared with 12 approved agreements totaling $82 million in FY24, according to the agency’s annual enforcement report released Thursday.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/eaTTWzJhyr7OT0iyNsNYh2_FyeCFKY5BdxHEE-dI720/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzI1Ny5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:10.863101

But the markup on “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776, showed the process has a long way to go.

Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) made changes to the bill to secure more Democratic buy-in. But in the end, the 25-18 vote only included two Democrats.

Still, Westerman stressed the importance of his bill, which would tighten timelines for National Environmental Policy Act reviews and reduce the potential for litigation. He said a wide spectrum of projects stand to benefit.

“NEPA abuse is strangling critical public and private investments, infrastructure, defense, energy and mining at a moment when we can least afford it,” he said.

Ahead of the markup, the Arkansas Republican heard pleas from several Democrats who demanded the bill include bolder language that would — in effect — force the Trump administration to reverse orders stalling renewable energy projects on land and off the coast.

His updated text released earlier this week, which states NEPA is a “procedural statute” that does not mandate an environmental outcome, seeks to provide “certainty” that a federal agency may not “rescind, withdraw, amend, alter or otherwise render ineffective” any environmental document unless ordered by a court.

In addition, during the markup, the committee did pass one amendment that would prevent an administration from pulling a legitimate permit for a project of any kind — something the bill’s co-sponsor, Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), said has happened “over multiple administrations.”

But that language did little to convince all but one other Democrat — Rep. Adam Gray (D-Calif.) — that the bill would address the clear, as one put it, “elephant in the room” — that is the Trump administration’s attacks on wind and solar.

“For us, we don’t just want a technology-neutral bill,” said Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.), who was in talks with Westerman. “We want a technology neutral outcome.”

Democrats emphasized the administration’s attempts to halt offshore wind projects, add red tape for renewable permits and cancel environmental review for the largest solar project in the country.

“It’s an insane war on the energy of the future and you all want to pretend it’s not happening,” said ranking member Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), suggesting Republicans were living in a fantasy.

And while Democrats asserted they were open to amending the 1969 environmental law, Huffman tried to beat down the “false narrative” that NEPA reviews have ballooned into “this monstrous thing.”

In fact, he said President Donald Trump’s White House East Wing construction project was a prime example of the importance of restraint.

“This is what happens when there’s no way to stop a dumb idea move through the NEPA process,” he said, displaying large photos of the site of the largely demolished wing.

He added, “We will help you fix this bill.”

Democrats’ failed amendments

Democrats tried to chip away at the legislation by offering a flurry of amendments that would strike or alter key pieces of the bill. All but Golden and Minnesota Republican Rep. Pete Stauber’s bipartisan permit certainty offering failed.

Huffman offered a total of six amendments, including one that sought to emphasize the importance of the purpose of NEPA. Others would have barred the legislation from taking effect until all clean energy projects and grants were reinstated.

Huffman also wanted to expand the scope of review to include long-term impacts, ensure increased transparency for draft documents and ax a provision limiting the scope of NEPA reviews.

Another Huffman amendment would set the statute of limitations for judicial review of agency decisions to two years; it’s currently six.

“That’s a pretty dramatic reduction,” he said.

While objecting, Stauber quipped that Huffman had “connections” to the Natural Resources Defense Council, prompting outrage from Huffman that derailed the markup for several minutes. They struck a agreement to resolve the dispute after a brief recess.

An amendment from Rep. Luz Rivas (D-Calif.) would have added renewable energy to the list of national policies for the Council on Environmental Quality to “foster and promote.”

Westerman shot back: “Renewable energy is already covered under the ‘SPEED Act,’” arguing the bill treats all forms of energy the same. “This is an amendment in search of a problem,” he said.

And Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) — who was just sworn in to replace her father, the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who chaired the committee for years — offered an amendment that would embed environmental justice to the list of CEQ’s national policies. Westerman objected that should not apply to a procedural statute.

Westerman wants to get the bill on the House floor by the end of the year. That could be a tall order given the shrinking timeline. But GOP leaders signaled their interest.

“Chairman Westerman’s permitting reform bill is a major priority of ours, and we’re going to be moving it on the floor as soon as it’s ready to go,” Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said in an interview after the markup, adding, “Obviously, we’re backed up from the shutdown so we’ve been working through it. … We’re going to keep catching up, but we want to get that bill moving as fast as possible because it’s a really important reform that’s going to create a lot of jobs.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/1d/30/85b0fc094b0284392c83a306eb96/u-s-congress-75300.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:38.755839

POLITICO interviewed current and recently departed CDC employees about the changed work environment.
Houry also noted that CDC employees who worked on a critical nutrition survey were not initially reinstated, as well as employees who worked on communications and policy.
“We know of people who have now received three RIF notices,” a third CDC employee said.
Kennedy and the CDC Other HHS subagencies, including FDA, NIH and CMS, have seen fewer rounds of firings than the CDC.","They’ve faced several rounds of firings and sporadic reinstatements, witnessed the dramatic ousting of their director and the resignation of top career leaders in protest. Some were shot at by a gunman targeting the agency’s Atlanta headquarters in August and all have watched as Kennedy fired and then replaced a key panel of CDC vaccine advisers.

In addition to all that, like most federal workers, many CDC employees went without paychecks during the longest-ever closure of the federal government.

On Wednesday, as some employees returned to buildings riddled with bullet holes, morale took another hit with a surprise update to the CDC’s vaccines and autism webpage. It suggests that vaccines may cause autism and states that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.” The move upended decades of work by senior career vaccine scientists to combat misinformation about a potential link between vaccines and autism – which many large studies have found no evidence of.

In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon described the change as a “common-sense update” to fulfill a “commitment to transparency and Gold Standard Science.”

He also said that Kennedy is trying to restore a “broken” CDC: “His focus is on returning the CDC to its core mission and ending the culture of insularity that has undermined public confidence.”

Some employees have a different take.

“On top of the never-ending feeling that we have metaphorical targets on our backs, a lot of employees feel like they have literal targets on their backs,” one CDC employee said. “The mood among CDC staff is ‘dead man walking.’”

The congressionally-mandated reinstatement of fired CDC workers marks at least the fourth time the administration has had to backtrack on planned firings of large chunks of the agency’s workforce.

POLITICO interviewed current and recently departed CDC employees about the changed work environment. Most of them were granted anonymity for fear of retribution.

Taken together, the eight workers described a culture of declining faith in the agency and a lack of guidance and communication from leadership. In his nearly three months on the job, CDC Acting Director Jim O’Neill has sent only one agency-wide email, two employees said, about how the agency should improve.

“Usually we have regular ‘all hands’ calls with the director. And the director takes time to meet the agency,” said a second CDC employee. “We’ve never heard the man even speak.”

Nixon said that O’Neill is having “almost daily meetings with CDC leadership” and has led the response to a recent infant formula recall.

In early October — just 10 days into the shutdown — the Trump administration laid off around 1,760 HHS employees, primarily hitting the CDC. It later reversed about half of those firings, citing “data discrepancies and processing errors.”

Democrats negotiated a provision in the continuing resolution that requires the CDC employees laid off during the shutdown and not initially reinstated — and the hundreds in the same situation at other agencies — be brought back. But CDC employees are skeptical that their reinstatements will stick.

“These people, especially those who received the reduction-in-force notices on Oct. 10, are wondering what happens Jan. 31,” the day after the continuing resolution expires, said Yolanda Jacobs, president of American Federation of Government Employees 2883 representing CDC workers in Atlanta.

“Are they going to be back [to] … being used as bargaining chips?,” Jacobs said. “When this administration makes threats, it does everything that it possibly can to make good on those threats.”

Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that promotes government service, said those concerns are not baseless.

“Come Jan. 31 — the CR ends Jan. 30 — all bets are off,” Stier said. He added that other protections governing the firing of federal workers still apply.

The laid-off CDC staff who were not initially reinstated include employees on the Institutional Review Board, which evaluates research studies, the Technology Transfer Office, which deals with patents, and the Employee Assistance Program, which provides counseling and emotional support for the agency’s staff, former CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry said on a call with reporters in October. Houry also noted that CDC employees who worked on a critical nutrition survey were not initially reinstated, as well as employees who worked on communications and policy.

The shutdown-ending deal means those employees are now being reinstated.

The agency has seen three large scale layoffs, in February, April and October — making it one of the hardest hit agencies during the Trump administration. In the days or weeks following each round, some employees have been told their firings were a mistake and asked to return.

“We know of people who have now received three RIF notices,” a third CDC employee said.

An agency in chaos

Despite the volatility, Amy Kirby had assumed her team — which had been working on a project to centralize CDC disease surveillance data from across the agency — was safe.

Kirby has been part of the leadership for the One CDC Data Platform effort since 2024, and the Trump administration had indicated it was a priority. O’Neill’s lone email to CDC staff after he assumed the acting director role in August pointed to the 1CDP project as an example of innovation, Kirby told POLITICO.

Kirby was shocked to learn that, on Oct. 10, the majority of employees working on the project – around 16 people — had received reduction-in-force notices.

Unlike many CDC employees that HHS has said were mistakenly fired, the 1CDP staff did not have their reduction-in-force notices rescinded the following day. HHS and CDC told Kirby’s bosses that the firings had been a mistake, she said, but “it was never reversed. It only got reversed when Congress put it in the bill.”

“It’s very odd that in a month, they couldn’t reverse what they were saying was a mistake,” Kirby said.

She believes the firings were purposeful. “Even if you’re working on an agency priority, they will still fire you.”

Kirby herself never received a reduction-in-force notice. But she decided to quit after most of her team was fired.

Her team is now returning, but they “don’t feel safe,” she said. “They are working under the assumption that in February they’re going to get RIFed again.”

“It is heartbreaking,” Kirby said. “I’m sad for the people that are still there having to struggle through all of that. I’m sad for our country that we don’t have CDC at its best.”

A fourth employee said they have struggled to plan for the future without a clear picture of what it will look like — and who will be left.

“We simply can’t do the kind of transformative long-term thinking that is needed for this work (or this administration) to be a success,” they said.

Several leadership positions have been left vacant, including chief medical officer. Houry resigned from that job in August, citing politicization of the agency.

The Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology lost its director, Jennifer Layden, after she too resigned in August. Kirby’s division — which sits inside that office — also had lost some staff, and needed to restructure.

But because no one had been tapped as acting director of the office, “there was no one to approve those changes” and the plan had to be tabled, Kirby said. “Then the shutdown hit and the RIFs added other pressing issues to resolve.”

Layden’s position is still vacant.

‘Basically a hostile work environment’

In addition to logistical challenges, the volatility has also created an environment where employees often feel they can be ousted at any moment. And they’ve also lost a key layer of protection.

In August, HHS moved to stop recognizing several unions, including one that represents CDC workers at the agency’s Atlanta headquarters.

Nixon, addressing HHS’s decision to stop recognizing the unions, said President Trump implemented Executive Order 14251, which excluded many agencies from collective bargaining, “to remove unnecessary obstacles to mission-critical work and space previously used for union activities.”

As a result, said Jacobs, there is no one to de-escalate conflicts, and more employees than usual are facing disciplinary actions.

Jacobs said they’ve seen more employees placed on performance improvement plans or suspended.

“When the union is in the building, a lot of these disciplinary actions don’t have to escalate to that point, because a lot of times, a lot of those situations can be resolved at much lower level,” Jacobs said.

Nixon said that disciplinary actions have not increased because of the union’s absence. “The suggestion is wrong,” he said.

The first employee said some employees who haven’t yet received a reduction-in-force notice have taken home all of their personal items in case they are suddenly fired.

“Any time that we are asked to unexpectedly meet with senior politicals, we assume it’s to fire us until proven otherwise,” said the first employee. “It’s basically a hostile work environment at this point.”

Many employees will be returning to buildings where bullet holes from the August shooting are still visible in the windows, Kirby said. A stabilizing film has been installed over them, but it doesn’t always obscure the damage.

“When the sun hits the window, the bullet holes and cracks show through,” she said.

Kirby said she heard from the Office of Safety, Security, and Asset Management that the windows could take more than a year to replace because they are custom-made.

“We continue to make necessary repairs and this takes time,” Nixon said.

Kennedy and the CDC

Other HHS subagencies, including FDA, NIH and CMS, have seen fewer rounds of firings than the CDC. The first employee theorized that Kennedy has targeted the CDC. Kennedy reportedly called the agency “a cesspool of corruption” during his 2024 presidential campaign.

During the years that he was active in the anti-vaccine movement, Kennedy would frequently disparage the CDC, claiming the agency was in cahoots with the pharmaceutical industry.

Since he took the helm at HHS in February, he has toned that rhetoric down, and occasionally praised the agency.

“Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty,” Kennedy wrote on X following the shooting at the agency. “No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.”

But after then-CDC Director Susan Monarez was ousted at Kennedy’s urging in August, she testified before Congress and recounted a conversation with Kennedy about vaccines where she said Kennedy emphasized that CDC employees are “horrible people” and said they were “killing children, and they don’t care.”

A spokesperson for HHS said at the time that Monarez’s testimony was “grossly distorting Secretary Kennedy’s concern about the CDC’s failure to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.” And Nixon told POLITICO Thursday that Kennedy “is committed to restoring [the CDC] as the world’s most trusted guardian of public health through sustained reform.”

But some CDC employees aren’t convinced.

“It’s obvious that RFK [Jr.] and the people he had brought into HHS harbor personal animus toward CDC,” the first employee said. “Some of it’s misplaced blame for the pandemic restrictions, but particularly with RFK [Jr.] the animosity started well before the pandemic.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc2%2F89%2F623741c44f49a025aca7628bb53a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2206773664,N,,2025-11-21 15:02:01.411765

Growth in relatively developed technologies, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, grids, and electrified transport, continued in 2024.
China and the advanced economies accounted for 90% of energy transition investment in 2024, contributing 44% and 46%, respectively.
The least developed countries (LDCs) accounted for less than 0.22% of energy transition investments and approximately 2.2% of renewable energy investments.
Energy Transition Investments The report stated that global renewable energy investments in 2024, calculated based on final investment decisions (FIDs), reached $807 billion, rising 22% from the annual average of 2022/2023.","Global investments in energy transition technologies reached a record high of $2.4 trillion in 2024, a 20% increase from the average annual levels of 2022/2023, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) ‘Global Landscape of Energy Transition Finance 2025’ report.

The annual investments in critical transitional technologies, however, remain short of the required levels to align with IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway.

Growth in relatively developed technologies, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, grids, and electrified transport, continued in 2024. However, the growth occurred at a slower pace in earlier years.

Investment in nascent technologies, such as green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, decreased in 2024.

In contrast, battery storage sustained significant growth during the year. The report stated that the investment share in renewable energy remained mostly consistent at 35% in 2024.

The IRENA report said solar is the only technology that has investment levels almost in line with IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario.

According to the report, the drivers and constraints faced by each technology are underpinned by investment distribution and investment amounts.

Critical technologies witnessed a significant disparity in investment distribution, with China and advanced economies being the primary hubs for innovation, deployment, and value creation. China and the advanced economies accounted for 90% of energy transition investment in 2024, contributing 44% and 46%, respectively.

The least developed countries (LDCs) accounted for less than 0.22% of energy transition investments and approximately 2.2% of renewable energy investments. A majority of these countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Additionally, despite considerable recent progress, annual investments in critical transitional technologies remain short of the required levels to align with IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway.

According to IRENA, annual investments in renewable energy generation must nearly double from the current levels to reach its $1.4 trillion per year target between 2025 and 2030. A significant increase in investment in renewable energy is also required for end uses beyond power, such as heating and transport.

The energy efficiency segment requires the largest increase in investment, needing to grow by seven and a half times to reach the target of $2.6 trillion annually between 2025 and 2030.

Energy Transition Investments

The report stated that global renewable energy investments in 2024, calculated based on final investment decisions (FIDs), reached $807 billion, rising 22% from the annual average of 2022/2023.

Approximately 96% of these investments were in the power sector, reaching $773 billion. Projects such as heating and transport with direct renewable energy use received 1% of the investments, totaling $10 billion.

Current investment levels in renewable energy are roughly half of what is needed to triple power capacity to 11.2 TW by 2030.

Solar is the only technology that has investment levels almost in line with IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario. Solar’s rapid cost decline, as well as global widespread policy support, drove these investments over the previous decade.

Adoption of solar technologies in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) was further driven by distributed systems, such as rooftop projects, as an alternative to grid-based power when it is unreliable, unavailable, or unaffordable.

Annual investments in concentrated solar power (CSP) need to scale up by 32 times from the current levels between 2025 and 2030.

IRENA stated that investments in onshore and offshore wind technology need to scale up by three and eight times, respectively, from the 2024 levels. Wind projects face challenges such as longer permitting processes, grid connection issues, and public resistance in some countries.

Investments in other renewable energy technologies, including marine energy, geothermal power, bioenergy, and hydropower, remain far below the required levels.

The installed renewable energy worldwide is expected to increase by 4,600 GW by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency’s ‘Medium-Term Forecast’ report.

Grid Investments

Power grid investments, including in transmission and distribution, rose 14% in 2024 compared to the 2022/2023 averages, reaching $359 billion.

Annual grid investments need to nearly double to reach $671 billion between 2025 and 2030, to support the integration of renewable energy and the adoption of technologies such as EVs and heat pumps, as was called for under the 1.5°C scenario.

Global spending on grids is projected to continue rising based on recently announced plans. However, most of these plans have been made in China, advanced economies such as Australia, the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the U.S., and EMDEs such as India, Brazil, and Indonesia.

However, for many countries, particularly EMDEs and LDCs, the core financing hurdles stem from limited government and utility resources, as well as the inability to recover costs from consumers due to non-cost-reflective tariffs.

IRENA said the private sector may be increasing its share of grid investment in some economies recently. Countries such as India and Brazil are increasingly relying on the private sector to expand their grids.

In economies with grid investments, only 16% of the overall investment in 2024 was directed to new connections, 44% to replacing ageing assets, and the remaining 40% to grid reinforcements.

Over 1,650 GW of wind, solar, and hydro projects were awaiting grid connection in 2024, up from 1,500 GW in 2023. The capacity of queued projects in 2024 was five times the new capacity commissioned in 2022.

In 2023, 65% of global grid investments were financed through market-rate debt. This investment came directly from commercial financial institutions and corporations. Project-level equity accounted for 33% of the investments, and the remaining 2% was funded through grants.

Only one-quarter of global grid investment in 2023, totalling $86 billion, was directed to renewable energy generation.

Battery Storage

Global investment in energy storage reached $54 billion in 2024, increasing 73% from the average investment in 2022/2023, and over 11 times the 2019/2020. IRENA said annual investments would need to triple to align with a 1.5°C pathway.

Battery investment growth was underpinned by a 94% decline in costs between 2010 and 2024. This was driven by scale-up in manufacturing, improved material efficiency, and advancements in manufacturing processes.

China is the largest global battery manufacturer, making up 40% of the worldwide investments in this technology in 2024. It also installed the highest capacity at 84 GWh (36 GW), an 80% growth over 2023, and accounting for half of the global additions. Provincial subsidies, co-location mandates, and the domestic availability of battery technology supported this growth.

China has set a target to install over 180 GW of energy storage capacity by 2027, up from 95 GW as of June this year. The capacity addition will involve an investment of approximately RMB250 billion (~$35 billion).

The U.S. benefited from incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2024, making it the second-largest battery storage investment destination during the year, accounting for 29% of the global total. It added 41 GWh (13 GW), nearly a quarter of the worldwide capacity.

Germany was the third-largest destination for investments, making up 11% of the global total.

Battery storage investments in developing nations such as Chile, India, South Africa, and the Philippines are growing, accounting for 3% of global investments.

Electric Mobility

In 2024, global investments in EVs, including battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in hybrid EVs, and fuel cell EVs, rose 33% from 2022/2023 to $763 billion.

The share of EVs in the worldwide car sales increased from 4.4% in 2022 to 22% in 2024. V charging investment grew by 27% in 2024, totaling $39 billion. Public charging received three-quarters of this investment. These chargers reached 5.6 million in number during the first quarter of 2025, increasing by 1.7 million from the end of 2023.

China, along with advanced economies, made up over 95% of the global BEV investment in 2024, remaining largely unchanged during the last five years. Its investment accounted for 49% of the global total.

China’s dominance stems from multiple state initiatives. It also installed 760,000 public fast chargers and one million public slow chargers, more than the rest of the world combined. China made up 60% of the global EV sales in 2022, as a result. It also extended its EV tax incentives in 2023.

Europe made up 23% of the global investment in BEVs in 2024, totaling $97 billion. Its share reduced slightly from 27% in 2022/2023. Growth in BEVs slowed compared to earlier, growing only by 6% since 2022/2023. The U.S. accounted for 19% of BEV investments in 2024, compared to 17% in 2022/2023. Investments rose 35% from $59 billion in 2022/2023 to $ 80 billion in 2024. This was supported by federal incentives, such as tax credits, and by multiple state-level programs. However, many of these investments have since been rolled back.

BEV investments in India and Australia rose by roughly 87% and 33%, respectively, between 2022/2023 and 2024. These investments totaled $8 billion and $4 billion, respectively.

EV Charging

Global governmental investment share in EV charging infrastructure reached 75% in 2024. The remainder was invested by private entities, of which three-quarters was from individuals and households. The remaining investment came from corporations.

Public investments in China with high-density urban living and limited home charger access accounted for 89% of the total EV charging infrastructure funding.

In contrast, in many Western markets, single-family housing enables greater home charging.

In Europe and the U.S., the public sector accounts for 60% and 62% of investments, respectively. U.S. public charging infrastructure investment grew by over 200% from 2022/2023 to 2024, from $1 billion to $3.3 billion. This was driven by programs such as the $5 billion National EV Infrastructure Program.

However, policy changes in early 2025 have disrupted the rollout of further funding by pausing disbursements.

Green Hydrogen

Investments in green hydrogen reduced for the first time in 2024 by 20% compared with 2023. This segment faces considerable economic, policy, and technological challenges. These include high production costs, uncertain demand, and limited transport and storage infrastructure. These hurdles expose projects to multiple risks that have materialised in many high-profile projects, leading to cancellations. Some projects reaching a final close are facing similar challenges.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-2023-01-31T135616.191.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 14:02:30.676339

U.S. new light-vehicle sales in November 2025 are projected to decline 5.2% year-over-year for a SAAR of 15.4 million units, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData.

New vehicle inventory reached 2.97 million units at the start of November for an 88 days’ supply industrywide, according to analysis from Cox Automotive. This represents a 2.9% increase since the end of September, but a decline of 3.8% compared to November 2024.

A number of automakers are urging major suppliers to find permanent alternatives to Chinese semiconductors in response to the microchip supply disruption involving Chinese-owned, Netherlands-based Nexperia.

The Nexperia supply disruption serves as “a warning shot for global supply chains,” and dependence on China for certain raw materials and technology is likely to increase risk for global automakers, according to commentary from Moody’s and Gartner.

GM directed a number of its suppliers to eliminate the use of China-sourced parts by 2027, according to unnamed sources in Reuters.

Automakers and suppliers are increasingly shifting away from global just-in-time supply chains to prioritize “regional supply chain resiliency.”

On November 18, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) provided an assessment of recent trade developments that included framework agreements with four Latin American countries, a deal with Switzerland, updates on China’s rare earth export controls, and a new White House fact sheet pertaining to the U.S.-Korea deal.

The Wall Street Journal reports China is considering implementing a “validated end-user” system for certain rare earth exports, and this “could make importing certain Chinese materials more difficult” for U.S. companies that have both civilian and defense clients. China dominates the processing of rare earth elements globally.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s plan to impose higher tariffs on certain Chinese imports has been delayed until at least December amid ongoing congressional debate.

The NAM submitted commentary to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative concerning practical steps to strengthen the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). In addition, NAM Vice President of International Policy Andrea Durkin plans to testify during the USTR’s public hearing December 3-5, 2025 regarding the operation of the USMCA.

OEMs/SUPPLIERS

A report published by MEMA Original Equipment Suppliers and consultancy Arthur D. Little includes an assessment of U.S. reshoring constraints and opportunities by auto parts category. The report also notes: “Labor remains the most visible pressure point, as higher wages (including benefits), limited availability, and persistent skills gaps raise costs relative to offshore peers. Automation offers a potential offset, but adoption below Tier 1 is constrained by high up-front investment requirements and limited integrator support.”

Crain’s Detroit reports automotive content at the Consumer Electronics Show in January is likely to emphasize products with near-term market applications over futuristic unproven technologies. The article also noted that certain major suppliers intend to skip CES 2026 amid efforts to reduce costs and maintain profitability.

Toyota CEO Koji Sato provided insights into how the company has achieved record sales and production despite tariffs and market uncertainty.

Honda reported its operating profit fell by 41% YOY for the six months ended September 30, 2025, and the automaker reduced its fiscal 2026 operating profit forecast by 21% due to expenses related to EVs, semiconductor shortages, and U.S. tariffs. Honda recorded 237.3 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in EV-related losses and expenses during the first half of its current fiscal year.

Ford became the second automaker after Hyundai to allow dealers to sell certified pre-owned vehicles through the Amazon Autos site in certain U.S. markets.

MARKET TRENDS AND REGULATORY

The CEOs of the Detroit 3 were invited to participate in a January 14, 2026 hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to discuss topics related to regulation and vehicle affordability.

The benchmark price for aluminum delivered to the U.S. recently hit a record high due to the impact of reduced inventories and import tariffs.

New-vehicle purchasing decisions were impacted by tariffs for 36% of consumers, according to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) Study.

The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s annual report to Congress warned China could exploit U.S. reliance on its supply chains, and noted that China “now possesses a hyper-charged, state-directed manufacturing base without historic parallel.” The report also urged policymakers to require industry disclosure of vulnerabilities to Chinese supply chains to better assess risk.

Autonomous Technologies and Vehicle Software

Waymo expanded its robotaxi service to highways in parts of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.

Tesla received a permit to operate ride-hailing services in parts of Arizona with a human safety monitor in the vehicle. The company also operates a ride-hailing pilot program in parts of Austin, Texas, with human safety drivers on board.

Amazon’s Zoox now offers free autonomous rides in parts of San Francisco as part of its early rider initiative, Zoox Explorer.

At Web Summit 2025 in Lisbon, Uber’s Chief Operating Officer discussed the opportunities and challenges associated with profitably commercializing autonomous vehicles. Developing software that supports safe autonomous driving was described as a problem that is “almost largely solved.” Challenges to commercialization include vehicle hardware costs, variable demand, and the inability of autonomous vehicles to respond to certain driving conditions.

Swedish autonomous truck company Einride plans to go public in a SPAC deal that is expected to raise $219 million. The company is seeking an additional $100 million of private investment in public equity to support growth.

HYBRID AND Electric Vehicles

New EV sales in October 2025 were estimated at 74,835 units in the U.S., representing a decline of 30% year-over-year.

Toyota plans to invest $912 million to increase the output of hybrid vehicles and components across five states, as part of a broader $10 billion investment over the next five years to support U.S. production. Toyota’s newly opened $14 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina supplies batteries for the automaker’s hybrid models.

Tesla intends to accelerate a strategy to reduce the use of China-made components in U.S.-manufactured vehicles, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.

Ford is reported to be evaluating whether to permanently end production of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck due to profit losses and changing market conditions.

Volkswagen and Rivian are considering selling EV technology developed by their joint venture to other automakers that could be used across a variety of powertrains. Separately, Volkswagen’s electric vehicle brand Scout Motors plans to establish its U.S. headquarters in Charlotte, NC.

BYD established a goal to sell up to 1.6 million vehicles outside of China in 2026.

Battery recycler Redwood Materials has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply critical minerals for domestic supply chains. The company’s Nevada Campus produced more than 60,000 metric tons of materials last year.

Canadian EV battery recycling startup Lithion Technologies filed for creditor protection.

Radioactively contaminated sites. These are just a few of the 249 hazardous sites across the Bay Area that could flood as seas rise in the coming decades in the worst-case scenario, according to a new report published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications.

The researchers project that 5,500 hazardous sites across the nation could be at risk of coastal flooding by the end of the century. Around two-thirds of these facilities are at risk of coastal flooding within the next 25 years, during 100-year flood events. “Historically underserved communities” are more likely to live near hazardous sites prone to flooding, the scientists wrote in a preview of the study.

Researchers from Climate Central, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Nanjing University collaborated on the study.

“The motivation for the study is that sea level rise is rising quickly, often more than projected, and is anticipated to more than double by 2050 worldwide,” said Rachel Morello-Frosch, a professor of environmental science, policy and management at UC Berkeley.

Seven states account for almost 80% of the hazardous sites at-risk by the end of the century. California is among them with 471 locations. That’s if human-caused climate change continues unchecked. State scientists predict more than a foot of bay rise by 2050 and over 6 feet by the end of the century in the worst-case scenario.

The list includes facilities that pose a risk to public health and communities: contaminated sites, former defense sites, businesses that handle sewage, toxic waste, oil and gas wells and other pollutants.

“We could avoid some of this flooding if we were to stabilize and then reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” said Lara Cushing, associate professor of environmental health sciences at UCLA.

But sea level rise won’t just mean water lapping over shorelines. As the bay rises, it will push groundwater up inland. The researchers noted that there could be more or fewer potential problem sites, as the study did not account for groundwater rise or the increasing intensity of storms.

Previous research examining rising groundwater found that more than 5,000 toxic sites may be impacted along San Francisco Bay alone. A KQED analysis from 2022 found that in the Bay Area community of West Oakland, more than 100 sites are at risk from both rising seas and groundwater.

The new count includes some of the region’s most contaminated sites, like the defunct Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. The U.S. Navy polluted the shipyard soil and groundwater with radioactive chemicals, heavy metals and petroleum fuels when it decontaminated ships, fouling the surface water and sediment in the San Francisco Bay, too. The Environmental Protection Agency declared it one of the nation’s most contaminated sites in 1989.

The research team found that neighborhoods most at risk have a higher “proportion of renters, households living in poverty, residents who identify as Hispanic, linguistically isolated households, households without vehicles, seniors, and non-voters than neighborhoods without at-risk facilities,” the scientists wrote in a press release.

Cushing said there could be as many as 300 fewer places at risk across the country if leaders and companies globally aggressively reduce emissions.

If people come into contact with floodwaters tainted by hazardous materials — sewage from wastewater treatment plants, heavy metals from refineries, or oils from fossil fuel facilities — the health impacts to people ramp up, said Sacoby Wilson, a professor of global, environmental, and occupational health at the University of Maryland.

In the aftermath of a flood, the “toxic soup” people may encounter could exacerbate health conditions. Wilson said exposure, depending on the chemical or sewage, during a flooding event near a hazardous site could lead to fevers, rashes, E. coli-related illness, and other symptoms.

“You have compounding vulnerability when it comes to their socioeconomic status and in some cases, the role of racism that led to that disproportionate burden,” Wilson said.

Federal lawmakers introduced legislation in July that, if passed, would set aside $5 million over the next year for the United States Geological Survey to study and map groundwater rise nationally through 2100. The agency would also need to identify priority areas that are at increased risk of flooding.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2024/09/004_KQED_BayviewBloodTesting_02252022_qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 14:02:16.676045

Enviri will sell its Clean Earth environmental services business to Veolia for $3.04 billion, the companies announced Friday.

Enviri also announced it will spin off its Harsco Environmental and Rail businesses into a new, publicly traded company.

Veolia says the deal will double its U.S. hazardous waste footprint and strengthen its presence in healthcare and retail, “allowing it to offer a full range of environmental services on a nationwide basis,” the company stated. Clean Earth has 82 locations, including 19 U.S. EPA-permitted treatment, storage and disposal facilities and over 700 operating permits across the country, Veolia said.

The deal is expected to close mid-2026, subject to regulatory approval, Enviri shareholder approval and the completion of the Enviri spin-off transaction.

“Over the past five years, Enviri has significantly enhanced the value proposition of Clean Earth, making it a trusted provider of industrial waste solutions with a strong customer base,” said Enviri Chairman and CEO Nick Grasberger in a statement.

Russell Hochman, who has served numerous roles with Enviri, including senior vice president, general counsel and chief compliance officer, will become CEO of the new Enviri spinoff. He has also been named president and COO of Enviri through the duration of the deal.

Grasberger will stay at Enviri through the completion of the Clean Earth sale and will help with the Enviri transition. The company will announce the board of the new Enviri spinoff in the future.

Veolia considers Clean Earth “a prime asset in the U.S. hazardous waste sector” and sees the Clean Earth portfolio as “highly complementary to Veolia’s.” It estimates the deal will create about $120 million of synergies by its fourth year. Veolia also highlighted expected operational efficiencies from the deal “due to enhanced logistics and expanded treatment capabilities and technologies, including PFAS treatment and new contaminants.”

The deal is also poised to help Veolia to further develop its business in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, areas it says are currently underserved. U.S. economic factors such as increased reshoring production and investments in advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, clean-energy production, healthcare and pharmaceuticals have helped boost its U.S. presence.

Enviri initially acquired Clean Earth for $625 million in 2019, and soon after acquired Stericycle’s Environmental Solutions business for $462.5 million. But Enviri later noted in its annual report that Clean Earth operates in “a very fragmented, regionally-driven market,” leaving room for growth.

Enviri sees the deal as a way to strengthen its balance sheet for its Harsco Environmental and Harsco Rail segments once it spins off into the new company. With the Veolia deal, Enviri plans to repay about $1.35 billion of existing debt. This will leave the new company with a “conservatively capitalized” net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization of about 2x, as well as an undrawn revolving credit facility and a “significant” amount of cash on its balance sheet.

That includes setting aside some of that money to support the Harsco Rail’s engineered-to-order contracts in Europe, said CFO Tom Vadaketh during a Friday call announcing the deal. The company has been working through cost overruns related to these contracts.

“While we’ve made significant progress on these contracts, risk remains, and we are evaluating what would be required to protect against this risk,” he said.

“We remain laser focused on continuing to take actions to stabilize Harsco Rail while leveraging innovation and service capabilities to support Harsco Environmental’s leadership and growth,” Grasberger stated.

The company had originally intended to sell its Harsco Rail business, but announced in August that it instead planned to sell Clean Earth following a strategic review. Harsco Rail has in the past hampered the company’s earnings due in part to unfavorable contracts, the company said.

Harsco Environmental provides onsite environmental services and material processing for the metals industry, and that segment has experienced weakened demand for services due in part to a downturn in the global steel market. During a Q3 earnings call earlier this month, Grasberger noted that upcoming policy changes in the European Union to raise tariffs on imported steel and lower quotas may help the business next year.

This marks the largest deal for Veolia since its 2022 acquisition of Suez, which included a range of assets in North America. The company’s acquisition spending in the U.S. has been relatively muted for waste assets in the years since, aside from a small 2023 deal in Michigan, but that began to change as it completed four deals throughout 2025.

The most notable was the June purchase of California-based Ingenium, which operates eight 10-day transfer stations in multiple states and employed an estimated 160 people. Other deals included Massachusetts-based New England Disposal Technologies and New England MedWaste, as well as Texas-based Chameleon Industries.

Veolia North America largely exited the MSW market by selling its U.S. assets to Advanced Disposal Services in 2012, but the company has also seen recent business gains in that area. Examples include the award of an operating contract for a mass burn combustion facility in Vancouver and multiple anaerobic digestion facilities in Toronto.

But hazardous waste and environmental services remain the primary focus for the North American division of the France-based company. Global CEO Estelle Brachlianoff launched a multiyear strategic plan in 2024, known as GreenUp, that envisions 50% revenue growth in the U.S. by 2027. This includes investments such as a new PFAS treatment plant in Delaware as well as an upcoming hazardous waste incinerator in Arkansas.

Veolia had already finalized an agreement with Clean Earth in 2024 to guarantee capacity at that incinerator, followed by a similar deal with Tradebe Environmental Services.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 Technology Transitions Rule increased the cost of new air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, particularly residential central air conditioning systems.

The Proposed Rule would provide additional compliance flexibility and thus help mitigate the cost increases.

The agency should consider additional steps to provide further regulatory relief for consumers.

I. Introduction

The undersigned free-market organizations have a longstanding interest in bringing to light the deleterious consequences of federal regulations, which are often neglected by agencies in their attempts to adopt their regulatory agendas. This is especially the case with regard to the many climate change-related regulations finalized in recent years. For this reason, many of us submitted joint comments to the Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 concerning the agency’s Allocation Framework Rule implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020. The Allocation Framework Rule set up the agency’s quota system for hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a widely-used class of refrigerants that were being targeted under the AIM Act. As we detailed in our comments, the rule and underlying agency analysis ignored the real costs to consumers.

The EPA’s 2023 Technology Transitions Rule, which was also promulgated pursuant to the AIM Act, made things considerably worse for consumers. It outlawed the use of certain HFCs in newly manufactured equipment, including residential air conditioning systems. Many of us also submitted comments on this rule, describing in detail its anti-consumer implications. These concerns have proven correct since the rule took effect on January 1, 2025. Indeed, the summer of 2025 was an extraordinarily expensive one for any homeowner in need of a new central air conditioning system, a direct result of this rule.

Fortunately, the EPA took notice and promised regulatory relief. This has led to the Proposed Rule at issue here.

As will be discussed below, the Proposed Rule offers regulatory flexibility that should partially moderate the cost increases created by the 2023 Technology Transitions Rule, and we strongly support it. We also welcome EPA’s request for additional reform ideas and offer several that could lead to further consumer benefits.

II. The AIM Act and Technology Transitions Rule

The primary purpose of the AIM Act is to phase down the production of HFCs based on their claimed contribution to climate change. Currently, the statute requires a 40 percent cut from baseline levels, which will ratchet down to a 70 percent cut in 2029. Not surprisingly, these production limits have led to price increases for these refrigerants and thus have raised repair costs for existing residential and commercial air conditioning and refrigeration equipment that relies upon HFCs. The HFC quotas are administered and enforced by EPA.

While the quotas are mandatory under the law, the AIM Act also includes a section entitled “Technology Transitions” giving EPA discretion to set additional restrictions on the use of HFCs in any category of newly manufactured equipment. Both environmental organizations and equipment manufacturers petitioned EPA to promulgate such restrictions, and the agency obliged them with the 2023 Technology Transitions Rule.

The Technology Transitions Rule sets out requirements for nearly every category of air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, but these comments will focus on the provisions applicable to residential central air conditioners. The rule requires that all such new systems manufactured after January 1, 2025 use refrigerants with a global warming potential (GWP) of 700 or less.

The majority of residential air conditioners sold in the years prior to this date used the refrigerant HFC-410A. These systems dominated the marketplace for many years (ever since the demise of earlier refrigerants banned for their claimed contribution to ozone depletion) due to their combination of superior affordability and quality relative to other available refrigerants. However, HFC-410A has a GWP above 700 and thus was outlawed in equipment manufactured as of the first of this year.

Two refrigerants have emerged as replacements for HFC-410A in new home air conditioners, HFC-454B with a GWP of 466 and HFC-32 with a GWP of 675. Note that these refrigerants and the equipment designed to use them had lost out to HFC-410A in the marketplace due to various shortcomings, including cost, performance, and safety. But now, these putatively climate-friendlier systems enjoy something close to a captive market as a result of the 2023 rule.

The Technology Transitions provisions in the AIM Act set out a number of factors the agency must consider when setting regulations, including “affordability for residential and small business consumers.” However, the agency dismissed any such concerns by asserting that the new systems “would be expected to have a similar cost…” and even claimed that “overall, the proposed rule is expected to provide net savings to the economy, which may in turn be passed on to small businesses and residential consumers.” Because EPA assumed away any consumer costs associated with the 2023 Technology Transitions Rule, the agency’s discussion of the environmental justice implications ignored the potential for adverse impacts on low-income households of costlier air conditioning. This was so despite the well-documented health benefits of air conditioning. Heat-related mortality and morbidity has been shown to be higher among those with low incomes, especially seniors, and the lack of access to air conditioning is a major contributor.

III. The Proposed Rule Would Help Address High Consumer Costs From the Technology Transitions Rule

Reality hasn’t cooperated with the EPA’s optimistic cost projections. The summer of 2025 was the first under the Technology Transitions Rule, and it was an extraordinarily expensive one for homeowners in need of a new air conditioning system. Those in the business of installing such systems report cost increases of about $1,500 for a typical home as a direct result of the rule. This includes increases in equipment and refrigerant costs as well as installation costs since the new refrigerants have a higher flammability classification than HFC-410A and thus require additional precautions during installation. Note that the 2025 increases came on top of the other AIM Act measures that had already raised prices since 2020. A shortage of HFC-454B throughout most of the summer exacerbated matters, though the price hikes for systems using HFC-32 were nearly as substantial.

Unlike the HFC quotas in the AIM Act, the Technology Transitions Rule is discretionary, and the EPA is well within its statutory authority to revisit it. This is especially so given the highly negative consumer impacts – including the disproportionate ones for low-income households – that were completely ignored by the agency during the rulemaking process. Thus, the Proposed Rule is the right course of action.

The EPA had allowed any remaining HFC-410A systems lawfully manufactured or imported before January 1, 2025 to be sold and installed for a year, until January 1, 2026. This deadline is rapidly approaching. The Proposed Rule would extend this sell-through period indefinitely, so that these systems can still be installed until they run out.

Doing so would be positive news for consumers. The manufacturers who had petitioned EPA for the Technology Transitions Rule now enjoy a near captive market for the higher priced compliant systems – which quite likely is the reason they lobbied for this rule. As it stands now, this near-captive market will become a total one on January 1, 2026, and equipment prices could rise even more.

The only escape hatch is the supply of legacy systems, thus keeping them available into next year and beyond would increase choice and lower prices in the residential cooling replacement market. One need not choose an HFC-410A system to benefit from the Proposed Rule, as the added market flexibility would likely serve to lower the cost of HFC-454B or HFC-32 systems once their market monopoly status is weakened. It bears mentioning that any homeowner who still wants the costlier but supposedly eco-friendlier systems would be free to choose them, but it would no longer be the only option available after January 1, 2026.

EPA’s failure to consider significant cost burdens—including impacts on low-income households—constitutes a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act under Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 (1983), requiring reconsideration or repeal.

IV. Additional Actions EPA Should Consider

While the Proposed Rule is clearly a step in the right direction, there are questions whether enough of these legacy HFC-410A systems are still around to make an appreciable difference for the 5-6 million American homeowners who purchase a new air conditioning system each year. It may be that the Proposed Rule, if finalized, will provide some measure of relief in 2026 but little or none thereafter. This is why EPA should consider additional steps to ameliorate the substantial costs imposed on consumers, up to and including full repeal of the Technology Transitions Rule.

Full repeal would have a negligible environmental impact. Even assuming the worst of climate change as well as the worst of the HFC contribution to it – and there is plenty of reason not to – the Technology Transitions Rule makes virtually no difference. The stringent HFC quotas elsewhere in the AIM Act will remain in place regardless, thus the Technology Transitions Rule only influences how this dwindling supply of HFCs is allocated. In other words, with or without the Technology Transitions Rule, the same declining volume of HFCs will be produced in the years ahead, either for use in new equipment or the servicing of existing equipment. Indeed, previous comments submitted by many of us suggested that the real purpose of the Technology Transitions section in the AIM Act was to get the air conditioning and refrigeration equipment makers to support the statute with the inducement of regulations creating lucrative captive markets in new equipment using EPA-approved refrigerants. It appears that this has come to pass.

Eliminating the Technology Transitions rule would add to the homeowners’ benefits in the Proposed Rule because it would allow at least some new HFC-410A systems to be manufactured and sold – and not just the remaining units made before January 1, 2025. The manufacture of such additional units would not be unlimited, as the overall HFC quotas would still be in place. But these systems could compete with the HFC-454B and HFC-32 units which would still be available but would lose their federally-guaranteed market dominance.

Absent full repeal of the Technology Transitions Rule, extending the deadlines by several years would also be helpful. Specifically, moving back the January 1, 2025 requirements for residential systems to 2030 would likely make an appreciable difference for consumers.

Note that beyond making changes to the Technology Transitions Rule, there are limited options for consumer relief within the constraints of the AIM Act. Most notably, there is no off ramp should the stringent statutory quotas for HFCs prove costly, as has proven to be the case.

V. Conclusion

The 2023 Technology Transitions Rule made an already-costly AIM Act even more so for consumers by restricting the refrigerants allowed to be used in new residential air conditioning systems. The Proposed Rule would allow continued sales of the remaining HFC-410A systems indefinitely and would be a helpful step that we support. Beyond that, we urge the EPA to do as much as possible to mitigate the consumer damage, and for this reason we encourage the agency to consider more comprehensive changes to the Technology Transitions Rule, preferably full repeal of this regrettable and unnecessary measure. Thank you.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. Plastics Pact published a position paper on chemical recycling, which aims to evaluate both the “potential benefits and their associated concerns” as the industry continues to invest in the suite of technologies.

USPP says it “supports the responsible integration” of chemical recycling technologies within a broader circular economy system meant to reduce plastic waste and reliance on virgin plastic. “These technologies may offer solutions for specific hard-to-recycle formats but must not displace efforts focused on reduction, reuse, or mechanical recycling,” it said.

USPP advocates for chemical recyclers to consider environmental justice and health impacts when siting facilities, as well as running such facilities in a way that it has lower emissions than virgin plastic production. It also called for more transparent data collection and third-party lifecycle analysis work to gain more insight into chemical recycling’s true output and effectiveness.

Dive Insight:

USPP’s position paper aims to strike a balance between what the organization considers polarizing opinions on the technologies. That divide can make it harder to fairly evaluate future impacts of chemical recycling on the greater circular economy, the position paper said.

“Too often, these technologies are talked about in extremes — either as a silver bullet or as something to be dismissed outright,” said Jonathan Quinn, president and CEO of the USPP, in a statement.

Chemical recycling, sometimes called advanced or molecular recycling, is a suite of technologies meant to break down plastics to their molecular building blocks to be made into new plastics.

Quinn said the industry, along with organizations signed onto the U.S. Plastics Pact, should think critically about chemical recycling’s potential but also “wrestle with hard problems and consider data-driven real-world solutions.” USPP was created to get major brands and organizations together, in part around shared packaging sustainability goals.

Chemical recycling has recently been a subject of both scrutiny and discussion, including at the federal level. At a congressional hearing in July, some lawmakers and plastics industry groups framed chemical recycling as an economic driver, while other officials and environmental advocates voiced concerns over the technologies’ potential health and environmental risks.

The position paper comes a few days after ExxonMobil announced it hosted U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at its chemical recycling plant in Baytown, Texas. That facility has processed about 100 million pounds of plastics since it opened in 2022, the company said.

“You’re seeing a proof of concept on advanced recycling get developed in a way that may inspire other cities and really this entire country,” Zeldin said in a video about the visit. “The capital investment seems to be extraordinary, and the future potential here seems to be limitless.”

USPP’s position paper calls on the industry to use the EPA’s Waste Management Hierarchy “to prioritize solutions with lower environmental impact.” USPP sees the ideal hierarchy order as starting with source reduction and reuse, followed by mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling would come next in the hierarchy “for formats that cannot be addressed otherwise.”

USPP sees chemical recycling as having the potential to capture more kinds of plastics for recycling, specifically hard-to-recycle types such as films and flexible plastics as well as some food-contact packaging that must meet strict FDA requirements.

It notes that some methods of chemical recycling use heat or chemicals that “can remove more contaminants than just washing the plastic, providing an opportunity to use PCR in some food-contact or medical-grade packaging with stringent quality requirements that cannot otherwise use PCR.”

USPP also sees chemical recycling as a key method for reducing reliance on virgin plastic and boosting the overall economics for recycled content.

The paper also notes that chemical recycling may be an avenue for advancing certain textile recycling goals, since some clothing and carpet are difficult to mechanically recycle. But chemical recyclers should avoid processing items that are “easily handled by mechanical recycling, such as PET bottles,” it said.

Some environmental activists and lawmakers have expressed concerns about chemical recycling’s impact on the environment and human health, a viewpoint that has been a rallying point for community groups who oppose chemical recycling facilities near their homes.

USPP urges the industry to include environmental justice considerations in all siting decisions. It recommends using tools such as California’s Enviroscreen or the archived federal EPA’s EJ Screen tool to determine where communities are most impacted by cumulative impacts of pollution.

The EPA under the Biden administration considered environmental justice an important pillar of its work, but earlier this year, the EPA under the Trump administration closed all of its EJ-related offices and shut down the EJ Screen tool, along with associated initiatives.

USPP “strongly supports the federal government resuming work to identify environmental justice communities and providing this information for companies to use in siting decisions,” it said.

USPP advocates for the chemical recycling industry to adopt manufacturing and regulatory best practices, meant to protect surrounding communities, that ensure safe chemical handling and disposal. USPP also suggests the industry adopt standards such as setting aside funding for potential environmental cleanup or remediation issues that might arise. “Robust standards and safeguards are essential,” USPP said in the report.

USPP also advocates for “use of fair and transparent lifecycle assessments or environmental benchmarks in evaluating facilities” to determine environmental impacts compared to virgin plastic production. An independent third party should evaluate the LCA for credibility, USPP said.

Tesla owns and operates over 75,000 Superchargers across the globe, where drivers can recharge their vehicles up to 200 miles in under 15 minutes.","Tesla’s first third-party owned Superchargers opened in Florida on Thursday.

The eight charging stalls are now open in Land O’Lakes, Bexley, and are branded as Suncoast Charging, a Florida-based EV charging company.

According to its website, the company aims to build a charging network and to improve the charging experience, “making it faster, more reliable, and accessible for all drivers.”

For that, Suncoast will be using “premium Tesla Superchargers for ultra-fast and reliable charging” and provide “NACS [North American Charging Standard] and CCS [Combined Charging System] port accessibility for nearly any EV driver.”

The company’s website shows that, in addition to the Land O’Lakes stalls, it has installed four fast chargers at Wesley Chapel, Lexington Oaks, which are likely Tesla Superchargers.

The charging hubs are open 24 hours a day and support several payment methods. They also include amenities such as “food, beverage, shopping, grocery, and lifestyle options.”

The stalls can be found through the Tesla app or through other navigation apps that support Supercharger live activity.

When questioned if they’re affiliated with the Elon Musk-led company, Suncoast says that “while we proudly utilize Tesla V4 hardware, Suncoast Charging is an independent company with no formal affiliation or partnership with Tesla.”

Supercharger for Business

Suncoast is Tesla‘s first client on the ‘Supercharger for Business’ program, which lets customers purchase and install white-labeled fast-charging stalls.

The chargers come with “the same hardware, software, pricing controls and service as those in Tesla‘s network,” according to the brand’s website.

These include features like downtime alerts and real-time availability, among others.

“We treat your site like we treat our sites,” Tesla says, explaining that customers are provided with “a full-service package that includes network operations, preventative maintenance and driver support.”

Supercharger Network

Superchargers are compatible with all electric vehicles, provided that they support the North American Charging Standard (NACS), which most brands in the US have adopted.

Late last month, EV start-up Slate became the latest automaker to adopt the NACS charging standard, following US EV makers Lucid Motors and Rivian.

Japanese Honda Motor Co., Detroit automakers Ford and General Motors, German-based BMW and Mercedes-Benz, and Sweden-headquartered Volvo and Polestar also use Tesla‘s network.

Earlier this summer, Rivian began updating its charging stations to integrate the port, which will come standard with the upcoming R2 SUV.

Adopting the NACS allows automakers to access over 25,000 Supercharging stalls in the US.

But during the Biden administration, numerous factors slowed progress toward construction, the study found.","Three former Department of Energy staff members have published a study saying the Biden Administration’s clean energy “rollout” was “comparatively slow” and proposing how a future effort can be faster.

“Speed of implementation is imperative,” they emphasized in their report, which they based on interviews with 80 federal employees.

During Biden’s term in office, clean energy progress was encouraging.

The Inflation Reduction Act and two other infrastructure laws allocated more than $1 trillion of funding to clean energy through tax credits, loans and grants, the authors estimate.

The Department of Energy “recast itself” from an agency focused on research and development to “an active commercialization partner.”

More than 900 companies announced new or expanded clean energy and manufacturing projects by January 2025.

But partly because DOE did not move fast enough, the Trump Administration was able to “move rapidly to repeal tax credits, cancel loan commitments, claw back grant funding, and stall projects.”

As a result, the “theory that economic development generated by clean energy projects and industries would create a durable bipartisan coalition was never truly tested.”

Beginning now

To have greater success in the next presidential administration that supports clean energy, detailed planning must begin now, the authors said.

“Ironically, the most salient recent example of such preparatory work was Project 2025,” which led to dismantling federal clean energy efforts.

Enabling the federal government to play an important role in advancing clean energy development “will require more thoughtfulness and detail than even Project 2025 achieved,” the authors say, because it is more difficult to build than to “destroy,” which they say was a focus of Project 2025.

And a clean energy plan must enable the government to move faster than the “slow pace of Biden-era implementation.”

The authors note that just four months after passage of a law creating the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933, TVA began construction on the Norris Dam.

But during the Biden administration, numerous factors slowed progress toward construction, the study found.

For example, a focus on obligating funds as the “scoreboard” for progress “created a false sense of accomplishment.” Obligation, the authors note, “indicates a budgetary commitment by the government to outlay funds for something at some time in the future. So obligation does not actually provide the funds to the clean energy project in question.”

It turned out that “a large share of funds was obligated in the last days of the Biden administration, and they were still months or years away from actually being spent on clean energy projects.”

The study provides 14 “implementation ideas” to enable faster construction next time. Among the recommendations are:

Establish an energy strategy actionable in four years

Establish efficient award designs and processes

Create a roster of hundreds of people who can be brought on and trained rapidly to implement within weeks

Rebuild the Department of Energy Adopt milestone-based, pay-for-outcomes support.

The report also lists several processes and approaches that worked well for the Biden Administration, as “example positives to build from.”

The report is titled “Implementing Federal Clean Energy Programs: Lessons Learned from DOE & Partner Agencies.”

Many families in Texas identify with same-sex parents, said Marisa Perez Diaz, a Democratic board member from San Antonio.","Texas’ State Board of Education is scheduled to finalize a state-approved list of instructional materials for the 2025 adoption cycle on Friday — a closely watched decision for education companies selling into the nation’s second-largest K-12 market.

As part of that process, the Republican-majority board began assembling a preliminary list of approved materials this week.

Submissions from three major publishers — HMH, Curriculum Associates, and Scholastic — faced scrutiny, with some board members seeking to remove them from the proposed list of approved learning resources.

Several conservative board members criticized the companies over alleged content issues, including claims their materials promoted critical race theory, social-emotional learning, environmental activism, same-sex couples, and the value of eating insects.

The board is considering materials for: math K-12; language arts grades 6-12 (English and Spanish); phonics K-3; and supplemental math K-12.

Texas serves about 5.8 million K-12 students across roughly 1,200 districts, making it one of the most critical adoption markets in the U.S.

Inclusion on the state-approved list has become critical, after a framework approved in 2023 tied $40 per student in annual funding incentives to the adoption of approved materials.

In the end, materials from the three companies were not removed from the proposed approved list, which would have relegated them to either the state’s preliminary “no-action” or rejected lists. A state law passed earlier this year prohibits districts from buying materials on the rejected list, though companies are allowed to revise and resubmit them for approval.

Despite the pushback, all the materials in question met 100% of state standards and received high-quality ratings from reviewers overseen by the Texas Education Agency. The TEA’s commissioner also recommended their inclusion on the state’s adopted list.

The debate underscores a key point for companies: Meeting technical standards and scoring benchmarks does not insulate a company’s products from scrutiny — whether political or ideological — in Texas.

The state board could revisit these materials when it takes its final vote Friday.

Windmills and Grasshoppers

HMH faced early criticism from speakers who called its authors “woke” and activist during public testimony that kicked off the meeting.

The focus was HMH’s K-5 reading materials.

Tamara McFarlane, who was contracted by TEA to review math curriculum for the 2025 cycle (not ELA), said the HMH text was “anti-American,” and contained “pervasive themes that include global pollution, immigration, and green energy.”

One module in the curriculum, entitled “Energy Island,” was highlighted because it centered on an island in Denmark that uses windmills. Other modules labeled “Project Earth,” and “Global Guardian,” also promote “environmental activism,” said Barbara Denson, who testified at the meeting, and has announced plans to run for the state board next year.

To that, Staci Childs, a Democrat from Houston serving on the state board, defended the lessons, saying “this excites me.”

“I didn’t really have a lot of environmental or a robust science education growing up.”

Another section of the learning resources discussing eco-friendly food also received attention.

Brandon Hall, a Republican board member from a suburb west of Fort Worth, read a passage from the HMH materials: “Dinner is served: on one big plate a juicy hamburger; on the other a heaping pile of grasshoppers. Ground beef or bugs? Which one do you think is better for your body?”

“It’s insane,” he said.

Board member Gustavo Reveles, a Democrat from El Paso, along the Texas/Mexico border, questioned the criticism.

“Many people in my culture eat grasshoppers,” he said. “What do we tell those moms?”

The board voted 7-5 to reject efforts to remove HMH’s materials from the preliminary approved list. The board also voted against other attempts to do the same with HMH’s Spanish-language reading materials, and the company’s supplemental math resources.

HMH did not return a request for comment.

CRT and SEL Concerns

Julie Pickren, a Republican board member from a Houston suburb, raised concerns about critical race theory and social-emotional learning with Curriculum Associates’ K-8 supplemental math products.

Pickren argued “socially responsive goals” in each unit amounted to SEL.

Social-emotional learning is not illegal to teach in Texas’ K-12 schools, but legislation approved this year affects a variety of aspects of SEL implementation, including a ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and prohibiting instruction regarding sexual orientation or gender identity.

Childs, the Democratic board member from Houston, said she spoke with Curriculum Associates and they assured her there’s no SEL in the math lessons. She added that culturally responsive teaching is not the same thing as critical-race theory, noting that reviewers did not flag any SEL or CRT issues.

“What we’re hearing is conjecture and political ideology,” Childs said.

Asked by another board member if she’d prefer the learning resources contained “culturally unresponsive” elements, Pickren said that Curriculum Associates should have focused its products to teach through a “patriotic lens.”

“It would have been wonderful to actually see instead of … culturally responsive training if we could have seen something that was patriotic to connect Texas students to a fondness and love of freedom to Texas and America,” she said.

The board voted 10-3 to keep the materials on the preliminary approved list.

Same-Sex Parents and Pilgrims

Scholastic’s K-3 phonics materials survived a 7-6 vote to remain on the proposed approved list.

Pickren requested the learning resources be moved to the preliminary rejected list because a book — which she claimed was part of the materials — is about a girl with two dads, which could violate the state’s DEI ban or prohibition on teaching about sexual identity. She also alleged the materials had a factual error claiming pilgrims from Plymouth founded Jamestown (the English founded the settlement).

That drew a rebuke from some board members.

Many families in Texas identify with same-sex parents, said Marisa Perez Diaz, a Democratic board member from San Antonio.

“I almost feel like a removal (from the proposed approved list) just based on that is quite discriminatory,” she said

Hall, the Republican member from the Fort Worth suburb, responded:

“I know for my district that directly putting stories into curricula about two dads and alternative lifestyles doesn’t match the good Christian values of my district.”

Scholastic denied the accusations in a statement to EdWeek Market Brief, saying a state board member “incorrectly suggested that the program included a particular book, which is not published by Scholastic, as well as inaccurate history lessons, which is not a subject covered by the program.”

“Scholastic can unequivocally confirm that the referenced title and content are not and have never been in the Ready4Reading program,” the company’s statement said. “We are eager to move forward in the IMRA process.”",https://epe.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/831b330/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1720x1150+0+0/resize/942x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fepe-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F47%2F185dac75495068120a2dac86a1a2%2Ftexas-flag-getty-image.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 13:01:51.417765

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.","(The Center Square) – Recent public comments from various industry and local government organizations to the Department of Ecology on a new program intended to help reduce the costs of switching to electric vehicles reiterated prior concerns, including logistical challenges, with EV mandates.

Washington state has adopted several California regulatory policies such as the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks. The goal is to have 100% light-duty EV sales by 2035, when it will be illegal to register a new gasoline-powered vehicle with the Department of Licensing. ACT requires that EV trucks make up an increasingly higher percentage of sales until they reach 75% by 2035.

However, in a public comment to the Department of Ecology, Washington Oil Marketers Association Executive Director Lea McCullough wrote that “we believe the ACT regulation, as currently constructed presents significant legal, economic, and operational problems that must be addressed before any further enforcement or implementation proceeds.”

McCullough cited numerous issues previously raised by others such as the Washington Trucking Associations, including the higher price tag for an EV truck compared to a diesel truck.

“Washington state should prioritize improving the efficiency and emissions profile of existing fuel infrastructure by encouraging the adoption of advanced, low-emission fossil fuel technologies – such as renewable diesel, cleaner-burning gasoline blends and investment in pipeline safety and modern fleet upgrades – rather than mandating ZEVs or imposing energy choice on consumers,” she wrote.

In addition to higher prices compared to regular vehicles, EVs also have a shorter distance before they have to recharge. The WTA said in its public comment that charging can take as long as 90 minutes to achieve a 200-mile range battery charge, whereas diesel trucks can fuel up in half an hour and go 1,500 miles or more before having to refuel.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.

“Numerous studies have shown that with the need to charge an EV truck during the course of the day, they simply do not match the efficiency of conventional trucks which often will have no need to stop even once during a shift,” he said. “Washington does not currently have the infrastructure needed to comply with the model that ACT envisions. We hope there will be consideration to proposals from industry partners that can assist in meeting a transition to lower emissions without significant disruptions to WA’s business community.”

Travis Nelson with the WA PUD Association wrote in a public comment that these logistical limitations makes them impractical for utility providers to adequately respond in the aftermath of storms, such as one recently that resulted in 200,000 customers losing power and caused local flooding due to blocked drain systems.

Nelson warned that “the current ZEV (zero emission vehicle) capabilities are not adequate to support these operations that often require hundreds of miles of travel to reach neighboring communities in need of regional assistance outside the local area in need. Please exempt Utility Service Vehicles from the zero emission vehicle requirements.”

Carly Michiels with the Washington Public Ports Association emphasized in a public comment to the Department of Ecology the importance of adequate infrastructure and energy supply, “while maintaining efficient freight movement and trade competitiveness.”

“We already know that we will be facing a significant regional energy resource gap starting in 2026,” Michiels wrote. “Addressing this needs to be top priority.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/98/6985020c-f120-4142-a30f-c1e5b47e836f/691f959e07ea0.preview.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:04:03.060106

I look forward to moving this bill forward in Congress to modernize our permitting system and unlock development and innovation in our communities.”

“H.R. 4503, the ePermit Act, will modernize outdated permitting systems and streamline how agencies coordinate reviews,” said Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR). “By moving to electronic permitting, we can reduce delays, improve communication, and give project applicants a clear and predictable process. I applaud Representative Johnson for spearheading this bipartisan effort to modernize permitting technology, and I look forward to working with him to move this bill forward in Congress.”

“Our permitting system is still burdened by an outdated, paper-based processes that slow down the projects Americans are counting on — from transportation and broadband to clean energy and climate-resilient infrastructure,” said Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA). “The ePermit Act moves us toward a modern, efficient, fully digital permitting system that will cut red tape, and today’s passage brings us one step closer to delivering results faster. As energy costs continue to rise across the country, it’s important we meet the growing demand for electrification, data centers, and clean-tech manufacturing. I look forward to continuing this momentum and working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to meet the growing demand in California, and across our country, and get this over the finish line.”

What industry leaders are saying about the ePermit Act:

“We applaud Representatives Dusty Johnson and Scott Peters for their innovative approach to modernizing the federal permitting process through the ePermit Act. By establishing a digital permitting portal and standardized data framework for permitting documents, this legislation will enhance clarity, uniformity, and efficiency across federal agencies. It will also improve transparency, facilitate real-time collaboration, and ensure better public access, ultimately streamlining the permitting process and our ability to develop critical infrastructure that will benefit Americans across the country,” saidChad Whiteman, Vice President, Environment and Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

“American Council of Engineering Companies, the business voice of the nation’s engineering industry, supports passage of H.R. 4503, the ePermit Act and applauds Representatives Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Scott Peters (D-CA) for their leadership on this important bipartisan legislation. The ePermit Act will modernize how federal agencies use technology to facilitate more efficient and timely federal permitting decisions. If passed, the bill will help to cut red tape by enhancing transparency, improving stakeholder engagement, and facilitating efficient interagency collaboration.”

“Our outdated permitting process is incapable of meeting the challenge of rising demand. This bipartisan bill will ensure federal agencies leverage technology to speed up environmental reviews. It's a critical piece of the broader permitting reform necessary to let America build,” said Jeremy Harrell, CEO, ClearPath Action.

“Manufacturers continue to support permitting reform to unleash American manufacturing competitiveness. The ePermit Act will increase efficiency and transparency in the permitting process, making it easier for manufacturers to push beyond the red tape, grow facilities and create jobs,” saidCharles Crain, Managing Vice President of Policy, National Association of Manufacturers.

“National Association of Home Builders commends Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Scott Peters (D-CA) for introducing the ePermit Act, legislation that would address housing affordability challenges by improving and expediting the environmental review and permitting processes. Permitting roadblocks delay housing projects and raise construction costs. This legislation will bring clarity, efficiency and certainty to the permitting process by requiring the use of electronic permitting platforms,” saidBuddy Hughes, Chairman, National Association of Home Builders.

""The American Petroleum Institute supports the ePermit Act as a critical step toward modernizing the nation’s outdated permitting system. By improving the process and enhancing transparency through digital tools, this legislation will improve efficiency to support the energy projects we need to meet rising demand. We commend Representatives Peters and Johnson for their leadership in advancing American energy and for spearheading efforts to bring federal permitting into the 21st century,” said Kristin WhitmanSenior Vice President of Federal Government Affairs at American Petroleum Institute.

“BPC Action celebrates the bipartisan efforts of Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Scott Peters (D-CA) to optimize technology to modernize federal environmental review and permitting processes for infrastructure projects involving roads, bridges, mines, factories, power plants, and more. The ePermit Act, introduced today, will provide greater transparency and predictability on environmental review and permitting schedules for sponsors and stakeholders. We commend this small, but important, step forward to improve our permitting processes,” saidMichele Stockwell, President, Bipartisan Policy Center Action.",https://dustyjohnson.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/dustyjohnson.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/2.png,N,,2025-11-21 14:01:52.767319

Year-round E15 would provide an immediate demand boost and brighten the otherwise grim prospects in farm country.
California retailers can now sell E15 fuel 365 days a year.

Are Trump, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP lawmakers really trying hard enough to secure year-round E15 and open new markets for farmers?","Farm state politicians have been trying for more than a decade to pass legislation that would allow E15 — gasoline containing 15% ethanol — to be sold year-round across the country. While E15 can be sold from Sept. 15 to June 1 each year, an antiquated glitch in the Environmental Protection Agency’s fuel regulations prevents gas stations from offering it each summer when America’s roadways are the busiest.

When I served in Congress, we got close and for his part, President Donald Trump tried to use administrative powers to remove that glitch during his first term in 2019. But, threatened by the competition of more ethanol, oil refiners sued to stop Trump — and they won. The courts found that only Congress can permanently remove the summertime E15 barrier.

So, with the 2025 congressional calendar ticking away, year-round E15 remains stuck in the mud and Big Oil’s ethanol barricade remains in place. Meanwhile, corn farmers are harvesting the largest-ever crop in history, corn prices are plummeting, farm bankruptcies are on the rise, and grain is piling up across the Midwest. Year-round E15 would provide an immediate demand boost and brighten the otherwise grim prospects in farm country.

E15 typically sells for 10-30 cents less per gallon than regular gasoline, meaning the summertime barrier prevents consumers from accessing a lower-cost, cleaner-burning option that includes a higher content of American-made fuel.

But here is the ironic twist. On Oct. 2, with the stroke of a pen, California Gov. Gavin Newsom did what President Trump and Midwest lawmakers haven’t been able to do. He signed Assembly Bill 30 into law, immediately legalizing the year-round sale of E15 in California, the nation’s second-largest gasoline market.

In signing the bill, Newsom stated, “While we continue the critical work to stabilize our state’s fuel market, we’re cutting red tape to provide consumers with more options as we continue our transition to cleaner transportation.” He also cited a recent study by the University of California, Berkeley and the United States Naval Academy, showing E15 “could lower gasoline prices by up to $0.20 per gallon and save Californians as much as $2.7 billion annually.”

Because California has its own unique gasoline specifications, the seemingly immovable EPA summertime barrier that bedevils states across the country simply doesn’t apply in the Golden State. California retailers can now sell E15 fuel 365 days a year.

Newsom’s move to allow year-round E15 could boost demand for ethanol by 600 million gallons, providing a sorely needed increase in corn demand. If California gas stations adopt E15 statewide, over 200 million bushels of additional corn — equivalent to the entire annual corn crop in Texas or Kentucky — will be needed to satisfy the new demand.

Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Trump and Republican lawmakers continue to promote the idea that Newsom and California have “waged war on liquid fuels.” Yet, the allowance to sell E15 year-round in the state would cement California as the single largest market for corn ethanol in the country.

All of this leads to some natural questions. Are Trump, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP lawmakers really trying hard enough to secure year-round E15 and open new markets for farmers? If California, the bastion of electric vehicles, can get it done, why can’t our leaders in Washington? If the president and his fellow Republicans want to “Make America Great Again” doesn’t that start with supporting American workers and helping all Americans save money?

While farmers are caught in Trump’s trade war, the president and Republican lawmakers appear headed for yet another round of bailout payments, rather than creating new demand opportunities for our nation’s corn and soybean growers. If they really want to help America’s farmers, they should simply follow California’s lead and do whatever it takes to allow year-round, nationwide E15 sales as quickly as possible.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/biofuelnozzle-2048x1346.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 13:01:34.176632

Despite the coal-friendly flip in US energy policy this year, the solar power revolution is here to stay. A case in point is the iconic coal-producing Appalachian state of West Virginia, where sheep are beginning to pull double duty as solar ambassadors.

Solar Power Trickles Into West Virginia

To be clear, West Virginia’s solar journey has barely gotten off the ground. Solar advocates in the state have dreamed of transforming derelict coal mines into solar power plants since 2011, if not before, with little to show for it. In 2020, for example, West Virginia held down the #49 spot in a state-by-state ranking of installed solar capacity, with only 10.52 megawatts to its name and a five-year projection of just 154 megawatts more.

Five years later, the state has over-performed that estimate by a respectable margin, coming in at 219 megawatts as of Q2 2025. Still, that’s not even treading water in this day and age. West Virginia actually lost ground to other states. It currently hits the bottom-most ranking of #50, according to data compiled by the Solar Energy Industries Association.

That could be about to change. The global firm Enel has spotted an opportunity in Brandonville, in the northern part of the state. Plans are in the works for a 100-megawatt solar power plant that has been reportedly been fast-tracked by the West Virginia Public Service Commission.

The Real Estate Factor

Or, not. Fossil energy stakeholders have held an unusually heavy grip on state policy for generations, which helps to explain why West Virginia officials are welcoming a new $144 billion loan from the US Department of Energy, earmarked to freshen up six aging coal power plants to last up to 20 years longer.

The real estate factor also comes into play. The American Farmland Trust is among the organizations pointing out that low-density housing — aka country homes — are among the biggest threats faced by farm conservation advocates, either by replacing farmland directly or by blocking farmer access to land.

The pressure from real estate interests is evident in the Brandonville project. On November 19, the news organization Dominion Post noted that only seven letters of protest have been registered so far over the project, but at least three of them advocate for real estate development of one sort or another.

“This small slice of West Virginia paradise should be reserved for the people who want to build homes, carve out homesteads, and keep the farmlands as they’ve been for years,” reads one somewhat self-contradictory comment (emphasis added).

“It’s one of the few areas in West Virginia where there’s good, usable land and is within commuting distance of good jobs,” reads another, skipping over the farm conservation angle entirely.

Similarly, another commenter is not concerned about any kind of land conservation, stating that “flat developable land would be tied up for over 30 years.”

The Sheep Factor

Into this picture steps the emerging solar grazing industry. In contrast to housing, strip malls, industrial parks, fulfillment centers and other forms of farmland replacement, solar power plants can host farm activities while fostering nutrient replenishment in the underlying soil. Without long swaths of asphalt and other permanent infrastructure, the land within a solar power plant can be returned to full farm use after the solar panels reach the end of their lifespan.

The emerging field of scientific research and professional expertise known as agrivoltaics, or agri-solar and agri-PV, is already taking shape in the livestock industry, where sheep are a good match for solar power plants. The solar grazing movement has taken off like a rocket in Texas with Enel playing a leading role there (see more agrivoltaics background here).

No word yet on whether or not Enel plans to introduce solar grazing in the Brandonville project, but sheep are beginning to appear at other solar power plants around the state.

It’s just a drop in the bucket compared to West Virginia’s coal power profile, but one sign of progress is the Mon Power branch of the sprawling energy firm FirstEnergy Corp., which has recruited 350 sheep to trim vegetation on an 18.9-megawatt solar power plant adjacent to the Fort Martin Power Station in Maidsville.

In a press statement, First Energy VP Dan Rossero made an enthusiastic pitch for agrivoltaics. “We’re managing this site with an innovative approach that blends renewable energy and agriculture for the benefit of our community. Solar grazing allows us to keep the site operating efficiently while supporting local farmers and reducing our environmental footprint,” Rossero said.

“By partnering with sheep farmers and advancing solar power, we’re making a positive impact that extends well beyond the fence line,” he emphasized.

More Solar Power Plants, More Sheep…

Solar grazing has emerged as a way for solar developers to cut the cost of conventional mowing and other vegetation management systems, needed to keep plants from overgrowing the solar panels. FirstEnergy also points out that sheep can graze directly underneath the solar panels, where conventional mowing equipment is difficult to operate.

The Fort Martin site is one of three solar grazing operations hosted by Mon Power, all located on brownfields and other former industrial properties. All together, the three sites have a capacity of 30 megawatts.

Toyota is emerging as another solar grazing fan in West Virginia. The company operates a 2.6-megawatt solar array at its Toyota Motor Manufacturing West Virginia facility in Buffalo. At one time, the five-acre array was billed as the largest solar power plant in West Virginia, and now it also hosts sheep during the grazing season, from April to October.

“Sheep have a carbon footprint far lower than the typical commercial mower and, unlike large mowers, they don’t spray rock and debris, which could crack or damage the solar panels,” Toyota enthuses.

The company also notes that vegetation management is among the major expenses of a solar power plant, making sheep a bottom-line partner in the solar industry. “Sheep farmers benefit, too,” Toyota observes. “They can add a new revenue stream by leasing land for solar arrays, or, in cases where they need to allow their land to lay fallow to regenerate, they can lease land with solar panels and rotate the flock.”

Among other farmer-related benefits, solar grazing provides sheep farmers with access to grazing lands protected against predators by high-quality perimeter fencing. Research also indicates that shade from the solar panels retains moisture in the soil, enhancing the quality of the grazing grounds while contributing to sheep health and wool quality, too.

Meanwhile, researchers at West Virginia point out that the state’s hilly terrain limits the opportunities for crop farming. However, solar grazing could provide an opportunity for the next generation of up-and-coming farmers to enter the agriculture business.

“Currently, 68% of agricultural producers in West Virginia have some sort of off-farm income because they cannot make a living in agriculture alone,” WVU observes, adding that “the idea of new and greener technology may appeal to younger generations, as the average age of agricultural producers in West Virginia is around 70.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-grazing-first-energy-wv.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 15:01:53.911464

Felipe Munoz at JATO Dynamics told Reuters recently that Chinese automakers face a price war in China that makes it difficult for them to make a profit in their home market. The answer for many companies is to export those excess new vehicles to other countries. Lately, Central and South America have become a hot new market for Chinese-made EV products

The Chinese have “carved out space,” for both electric and conventional cars, said Martin Bresciani, president of Chile’s automotive business chamber, CAVEM. “The Chinese have already demonstrated that they match global standards in quality.” Chinese brands reached 29.6% of all new passenger car sales in Chile in the first quarter of this year.

The share of EV sales in South and Central America has doubled this year compared to 2024. The total across the entire region is just 4%, but in some markets, that percentage is much higher. In September, EV sales in Chile were 10.6%, 9.4% in Brazil, and 28% in Uruguay. BYD is the market leader in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay.

Part of China’s success has been partnering with trusted local importers to offer more affordable models tailored ​to regional tastes, according to seven dealerships Reuters spoke to in Peru, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina. In Uruguay, BYD is the third largest brand behind only Chevrolet and Hyundai and now has a 22% market share in that country.

Boosting Market Share

Chinese brands such as BYD are pulling every lever to gain market share. In Uruguay, Gonzalo Elgorriaga, who owns a luxury car dealership, told Reuters, “The Chinese struck first and struck hard.” They collaborate with local banks to offer credit lines, but they also are highly competitive on price. The least expensive EV from BYD costs just $19,000. “I can buy three Chinese pick-ups, for the price of two traditional brands. That’s a big difference,” said Federico Guarino, another Uruguayan car dealer,

There is more to it than just price. As part of its Belt and Road strategy, China constructed a new state of the art port facility in Chancay, Peru. While the port is available to all ships, it makes things especially convenient for those bringing in cars from China.

“Each ship brings 800 to 1,200 vehicles,” Gonzalo Rios, deputy manager at Cosco Shipping, the port operator, told Reuters. Cosco expects the total number of vehicle arrivals from China to reach 19,000 by the end of the year.

From Chancay, the cars are distributed to Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia. Chery is also using the port to bring its cars to South and Central America. Peruvian ​customs data shows that in July, 3,057 cars arrived at the port, up from 839 in January. Peru does not have a large scale car manufacturing industry to protect from the sale of Chinese cars.

EVs In Brazil

The situation is different in Brazil, the largest country in South America. There the arrival of Chinese companies has lead to tensions. Unlike Peru, Brazil has a tariff structure that encourages companies to manufacture vehicles locally. BYD began assembling EVs at a former Ford factory in Bahia in October and Great Wall Motors launched partial production in August at a repurposed Mercedes-Benz facility.

Ricardo Bastos, of GWM Brazil and president of the country’s EV association, said the company expects to begin exporting vehicles from its Brazil factory to the region by 2027, thanks to favorable trade agreements with Mexico, Chile, and the South American trade bloc Mercosur. “Brazil was the third country to receive a Great Wall factory ‍after Russia and Thailand. It’s a strategic decision, showing the strength Latin America has,” ⁠Bastos said.

Brazilian industry and labor groups say China is taking advantage of temporarily low tariff barriers for EVs to ramp up its exports rather than investing to build Brazilian factories and create jobs. BYD has also faced scrutiny over reports of poor conditions for some workers at its new Bahia plant. The government has since moved to re-impose import duties of up to 35% by the middle of next year.

Brazil could soon challenge Chancay in Peru as a regional distribution center. The port of Vitoria on Brazil’s southeastern Atlantic coast currently leads in national vehicle imports and the port of Itajai further north recently received a shipment of 22,000 vehicles. BYD’s country manager for Argentina, Stephen Deng told Reuters in October that the company was expecting arrivals from Brazil in 2027. “I think we could eventually see Argentina adopting the same EV rates that we see in Brazil.”

EV charging infrastructure along many South American travel routes is still in its infancy, a fact that has led many drivers to use a low cost electric car for their daily driving needs, while keeping a conventional car in reserve for longer trips. The lowest priced EVs can only go a relatively short distance before needing to be recharged.

EVs In Uruguay

Uruguay, which is located just south of Brazil, is one of the smallest countries in South America but is a leader in the EV revolution. It is also a leader in clean energy technologies. EVs accounted for about a quarter of all new vehicle sales in Uruguay through October — more than double last year’s share. Sales of electric cars are helped by a zero import duty, excise tax exemptions, and gasoline that costs more than $7.00 a gallon. That combination of factors — which sounds a lot like how Norway began its transition to EVs — is attracting lots of customers for electric cars.

About 90% of the 11,000 EVs sold this year in Uruguray came from Chinese brands such as BYD, JAC, and Omoda. The BYD Seagull costs just under $20,000 and can save drivers significant money in fuel costs if they charge at home. However, most of those inexpensive cars from Chinese companies have a fairly short range, which makes them unsuitable for longer journeys in a region where fast charging along major transportation routes is still lacking.

Maria Clara Sole lives near Montevideo, the capitol city of Uruguay. She told the Detroit News she typically drives about 60 kilometers (37 miles) a day commuting to work and shuttling her children around in the BYD Yuan Pro she and her husband purchased last year. She estimates she saves up to $400 per month by charging her SUV at home versus filling the tank of a conventional car at a gas station.

She and her husband also own an SUV with a gasoline engine, which they use for longer road trips. “We aren’t ready to go fully electric with both cars. There’s still some uncertainty — especially if I want to drive to Argentina or Brazil. That possibility is limited if it’s not a gasoline powered car,” she said.

Software engineer Nicolas Jodal drives a Tesla Model X, one of a handful of Teslas imported to South America every year. He told Detroit News that electric cars are “extremely cheap to operate. I don’t think I manage to spend 500 pesos ($12) a month” on electricity. After experiencing his Tesla, he said the internal combustion engine is “an outdated technology that has no future, at least for passenger transport vehicles.”

Uruguay exempts EVs from its 23% import duty and the excise tax on passenger vehicles. Gasoline costing about $7.40 per gallon and a growing network of charging stations nationwide have also helped make electric cars a more popular choice for its 3.5 million citizens. The most common brands of conventional cars sold in Uruguay come from Ford, Fiat, or Toyota — all of which have shunned the EV opportunity so far.

Uruguay’s use of tax incentives to boost adoption could serve as a model for other small countries that do not currently have a domestic auto manufacturing industry to protect, Rafael Rabioglio, the head of research for Bloomberg NEF in Latin America, said. Bloomberg now forecasts battery-electric and plug-in hybrid sales will total more than 400,000 this year — about 8% of the new car market in Latin America. That’s up from just 2% in 2023. “If it wasn’t for the Chinese, I’m not sure we would have seen this transition happening recently in Latin America,” Rabioglio said.

The good news is that Chinese companies are able to sell competitive electric vehicles in South and Central America at prices that are equivalent to gasoline-powered models. The not so good news is that mainstream automakers from the US and Europe are unable or uninterested in doing the same.

The region has a patchwork of import duties and EV incentives, which makes it difficult to make accurate predictions about the future of EVs there, but the transition to electric mobility has begun and shows every sign of gaining momentum, thanks to the supply of electric cars from Chinese manufacturers.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/p2-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 13:01:46.139797

South Louisiana, we get a few hurricanes here and there.
First Solar is poised to deliver a financial boon to Iberia Parish, said Reuven Proenca, director of global brand, corporate, and marketing communications at First Solar.
The New Iberia location can produce up to 3.5 GW worth of solar panels annually.
In an energy-hungry America, Antoun said, solar remains the cheapest and most quickly deployable form of energy.","When Georges Antoun came to Louisiana from Lebanon in the early 1980s, he needed money.

The country was entering an oil crisis, and cities along the Gulf Coast — especially places like Lafayette that depended on oil and gas jobs — felt the hit first.

As families moved to larger cities like Houston in search of work, Antoun began offering a service: For a fee, he’d drive their moving trucks back to Louisiana.

It's no secret that Louisiana has long lost talent to its western neighbor and has sought ways to entice them back.

The opening of First Solar's $1.1 billion solar panel manufacturing facility near New Iberia has allowed Antoun, now the company's chief commercial officer, to have conversations with families who have chosen to return to Louisiana to work at the facility, which will celebrate its grand opening on Friday after the project was announced just over two years ago.

The 2.4 million-square-foot mega complex is one of the largest investments in the Acadiana region and is expected to provide over 800 jobs by the end of 2025.

It is now the company's fifth U.S. manufacturing facility and is expected to help fuel America's growing energy needs all while using a 100% American supply line. The opening comes on the heels of First Solar's recent announcement that it would build a $330 million plant in the town of Gaffney, South Carolina.

The Louisiana investment is already paying dividends, with Acadiana manufacturers like Noble Plastics announcing in September that it would undergo an $8.5 million expansion to supply the New Iberia location. Ohio-based Ice Industries recently celebrated the grand opening of its $6 million manufacturing facility in Jefferson Davis Parish, which will produce steel backrails for First Solar's photovoltaic panels.

""You feel the impact immediately, ""Antoun said. ""I'm very proud, given that I'm a Louisiana boy. ""

The idea to bring the facility to south Louisiana wasn't without its hurdles, he added. The state, known for its damaging hurricanes and flooding, at first made the board uneasy, but it had one thing going for it — a highly skilled, easily transferable workforce.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette and South Louisiana Community College were also eager to help win over the company, providing a curriculum and simulated training for new hires, and tapping the university for a large portion of its workforce.

""Pushback is normal,"" he said. ""Louisiana is a tough place to build. South Louisiana, we get a few hurricanes here and there. Flooding, tax-wise, insurance-wise. This took a bit of doing and bringing it here. But the company was committed to drive it in here.""

""(UL-Lafayette) produces a tremendous amount of engineers and technical degrees, and a lot of folks don't want to leave the area. They want to stay here.""

First Solar is poised to deliver a financial boon to Iberia Parish, said Reuven Proenca, director of global brand, corporate, and marketing communications at First Solar. The company is expected to contribute the equivalent of $150 million to the parish's GDP in the first year of operation.

The company will also provide high-paying jobs averaging $80,000 to $90,000, totaling $75 million in annual labor income, according to data collected by the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center at UL.

Antoun also believes the company will likely continue its rapid growth as the largest solar panel manufacturer in the western hemisphere. Just seven years ago, the company could produce around 2.5 gigawatts of solar panels a year, compared to the 17.7 GW it expects to create once the South Carolina facility is operational.

The New Iberia location can produce up to 3.5 GW worth of solar panels annually.

President Donald Trump has made his distaste for renewable energy well known over the years, going as far as sunsetting Biden-era solar tax credits earlier than they were set to expire. The decision killed dozens of early-stage utility-scale solar projects planned for Louisiana.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.
A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.","(The Center Square) – Recent public comments from various industry and local government organizations to the Department of Ecology on a new program intended to help reduce the costs of switching to electric vehicles reiterated prior concerns, including logistical challenges, with EV mandates.

Washington state has adopted several California regulatory policies such as the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks. The goal is to have 100% light-duty EV sales by 2035, when it will be illegal to register a new gasoline-powered vehicle with the Department of Licensing. ACT requires that EV trucks make up an increasingly higher percentage of sales until they reach 75% by 2035.

However, in a public comment to the Department of Ecology, Washington Oil Marketers Association Executive Director Lea McCullough wrote that “we believe the ACT regulation, as currently constructed presents significant legal, economic, and operational problems that must be addressed before any further enforcement or implementation proceeds.”

McCullough cited numerous issues previously raised by others such as the Washington Trucking Associations, including the higher price tag for an EV truck compared to a diesel truck.

“Washington state should prioritize improving the efficiency and emissions profile of existing fuel infrastructure by encouraging the adoption of advanced, low-emission fossil fuel technologies – such as renewable diesel, cleaner-burning gasoline blends and investment in pipeline safety and modern fleet upgrades – rather than mandating ZEVs or imposing energy choice on consumers,” she wrote.

In addition to higher prices compared to regular vehicles, EVs also have a shorter distance before they have to recharge. The WTA said in its public comment that charging can take as long as 90 minutes to achieve a 200-mile range battery charge, whereas diesel trucks can fuel up in half an hour and go 1,500 miles or more before having to refuel.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.

“Numerous studies have shown that with the need to charge an EV truck during the course of the day, they simply do not match the efficiency of conventional trucks which often will have no need to stop even once during a shift,"" he said. “Washington does not currently have the infrastructure needed to comply with the model that ACT envisions. We hope there will be consideration to proposals from industry partners that can assist in meeting a transition to lower emissions without significant disruptions to WA’s business community.”

Travis Nelson with the WA PUD Association wrote in a public comment that these logistical limitations makes them impractical for utility providers to adequately respond in the aftermath of storms, such as one recently that resulted in 200,000 customers losing power and caused local flooding due to blocked drain systems.

Nelson warned that “the current ZEV (zero emission vehicle) capabilities are not adequate to support these operations that often require hundreds of miles of travel to reach neighboring communities in need of regional assistance outside the local area in need. Please exempt Utility Service Vehicles from the zero emission vehicle requirements.”

Carly Michiels with the Washington Public Ports Association emphasized in a public comment to the Department of Ecology the importance of adequate infrastructure and energy supply, “while maintaining efficient freight movement and trade competitiveness.”

“We already know that we will be facing a significant regional energy resource gap starting in 2026,” Michiels wrote. “Addressing this needs to be top priority.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_center_square_articles_912/04a961826cd7c56f6e35579aecd9b779,N,,2025-11-21 14:02:43.334231

Regenerative Farming: A Simple Way to Heal Soil and Cut Emissions

Regenerative agriculture is becoming a powerful tool in the fight against climate change. It helps the soil store more carbon, keeps water in the ground, and strengthens farms against extreme weather.

Carbon by Indigo: Empowering Farmers With High-Value Carbon Credits

Farmers who join Carbon by Indigo receive guidance on practices like:

Planting cover crops

Reducing tillage

Rotating crops

Using nitrogen more efficiently

These methods build healthier soil and reduce runoff. They also improve air quality and make farmland more resilient over time.

The company produces high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits that help farmers strengthen their bottom line while enabling corporations to reduce risk by supporting carbon removals, emission reductions, and water benefits.

Under its standard program, the company returns 75% of the carbon credit purchase price to the farmer.

Even though water conditions vary by region, the project achieved a notable result: on average, each metric ton of carbon removed conserved approximately 69,000 gallons of water. This demonstrates how regenerative practices enable farmers to adapt to changing climate conditions while enhancing productivity.

Supporting 150 Farmers Across Five States

Honda’s investment supports about 150 farmers near its U.S. operations in Alabama, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Altogether, these farmers manage 214,000 acres of farmland using regenerative methods.

Importantly, all carbon credits in the Carbon by Indigo program are independently verified by Aster Global Environmental Solutions and issued by the Climate Action Reserve, a widely trusted carbon registry.

Honda’s Road to Decarbonization: Cutting Emissions From Products and Operations

Honda has shown leadership in environmental efforts for over 50 years. Now, the company is moving quickly toward an electric and low-carbon future.

It reported 296.86 million t-CO₂e in total global greenhouse gas emissions for FY2025. About 80% of these emissions come from product use (Scope 3 Category 11). The remaining 20% comes from direct operations and upstream/downstream activities.

Because of this, Honda is prioritizing emission cuts from product use and business operations. The company aims to reach full carbon neutrality by 2050, aiming to increase sales of electric and hybrid vehicles in North America and other major markets.

Triple Action to ZERO: Honda’s Framework for a Sustainable Future

Honda’s clean energy target is ambitious, and its environmental vision is shaped by its “Triple Action to ZERO” strategy, which includes:

Carbon Neutrality – achieving net-zero CO₂ emissions

Clean Energy – switching fully to carbon-free energy sources

Resource Circulation – creating products with sustainable and recyclable materials

These three actions connect to global climate and biodiversity goals. Honda also supports Nature-based Solutions, such as restoring forests and ecosystems, to increase its positive environmental impact.

Honda also trains suppliers through the Green Excellence Academy and supports dealerships through the Environmental Leadership Program, so the entire value chain can lower emissions.

Protecting Biodiversity Across the Globe

Honda is protecting ecosystems near its facilities through forest projects and greenbelt expansion. In Ohio, the company created the Honda Power of Dreams Forest, planting 85,000 trees over 40.5 hectares to restore riparian zones and create wildlife habitats.

Similar initiatives are underway in Europe and Brazil. In Belgium, Honda is restoring black poplar trees and building insect hotels and ponds to boost biodiversity. In the Amazon rainforest, Honda maintains 80% of its motorcycle test course as a protected conservation area and supports replanting endangered species like mahogany and rosewood.

A Long-Term Commitment to a Cleaner Future

Honda’s partnership with Carbon by Indigo reflects its broader mission to cut emissions, expand clean energy, and support sustainable communities. Through regenerative agriculture, renewable energy, circular manufacturing, and biodiversity programs, Honda is building a pathway toward a Zero Environmental Impact Society by 2050.

Advertisement Regulators, though, allowed substantial flexibility in which land NECEC proposed to conserve, and how.
The land will be administered as a working forest conservation easement by the Maine Bureau of Lands and Parks.
Environmental groups expressed concerns that Wednesday’s approval will set a dangerous precedent for future developments.","Three big takeaways:

With this final approval, Central Maine Power’s controversial transmission line eight years in the making can complete construction and connect to a Canadian hydropower plant.

Environmental groups argued the conservation plan does not sufficiently protect mature forest land and maintain habitat connectivity, but state regulators disagreed.

The connection to Hydro-Québec’s plant will introduce 1,200 megawatts to the New England grid — a move that NECEC says could lower electrical utility costs across Maine by more than $14 million per year.

State regulators approved a 50,000-acre conservation plan this week for the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line through rural northwestern Maine, clearing a final hurdle for the project’s completion.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection’s approval Wednesday marked the end of an eight-year saga to authorize the 53-mile line and connect a Canadian hydroelectric plant to a converter station in Lewiston through remote portions of Franklin and Somerset counties. Construction is expected to be finished by the end of the year.

NECEC, a partner of Central Maine Power Co. and a subsidiary of CMP parent Avangrid, began planning the project in 2017 and faced immediate opposition from Maine-based environmental groups, who said the project would have serious impacts on habitats, scenery and natural resources.

State environmental regulators required the permanent conservation of about 78 square miles near the line earlier this year as mitigation for those environmental and ecological concerns.

NECEC submitted its conservation plan in May. Regulators at the Maine Department of Environmental Protection determined that plan satisfied their requirements.

“This achievement is the culmination of years of hard work, collaboration, and perseverance,” Avangrid CEO Jose Antonio Miranda said in a news release Wednesday. “We have secured every permit, met every regulatory requirement, and overcome significant challenges because we believe we must address the urgent need for reliable energy at a time of rising demand. Today, we stand ready to deliver on that promise.”

Environmental groups argued the proposal didn’t go far enough and should have been rejected. Forests in the area have been heavily harvested, the groups argued, and the value of the conserved land didn’t meet habitat connectivity standards, given that it is split by U.S. Route 201 and other roads and transmission lines. The NECEC transmission line itself requires a 150-foot-wide swath of cleared land.

The groups were especially frustrated with NECEC’s proposals for conserving “mature forest.”

“NECEC came up with their own definition of what constitutes a mature forest and told regulators to wait nearly half a century for trees to just barely meet that flawed definition,” the Appalachian Mountain Club, Maine Audubon, Natural Resources Council of Maine and Trout Unlimited said in a joint statement. “The DEP has wrongly accepted this approach, setting an unacceptable precedent that Maine’s other natural resources agencies urged against.”

WHAT’S IN THE CONSERVATION PLAN?

Following a 29-month permitting process, the Maine DEP required NECEC to develop a plan to conserve land near the transmission line, saying the project would have “substantial impacts” that required extensive mitigation measures to “avoid or minimize those impacts.”

State regulators set a high bar for the conservation area, including promoting habitat connectivity, conserving “mature forest” areas and providing wildlife travel corridors.

Regulators, though, allowed substantial flexibility in which land NECEC proposed to conserve, and how.

NECEC chose a 50,000-acre area owned by Weyerhaeuser Co. — a lumber company and one of the largest private landowners in the United States — which it plans to acquire for an unspecified fee. The parcel is made up of several stretches of forest and wetland that are separated by U.S. Route 201, the transmission line itself and other power lines.

Public access to the land will be guaranteed in perpetuity, even beyond the decommissioning of the NECEC project.

The land will be administered as a working forest conservation easement by the Maine Bureau of Lands and Parks. It connects to 400,000 other permanently conserved acres, creating one of the largest contiguous conservation areas in the state.

As a working forest, the land will be open for logging, except for no-cut buffers around streams and wetlands. NECEC proposed operating the land as a “shifting mosaic” — meaning the location of mature forest to shift over time, as long as at least half of the working forest is mature after 2065.

This was a big sticking point for critics of the project. Habitat connectivity was a central part of the state’s requirements, given the impact of the transmission line cutting through the rural Maine woods.

Environmental groups said maintaining “mature forest” would be nearly impossible if most of the land was open for logging.

The groups also argued that the area doesn’t actually include much mature forest at all. Using remote sensing techology LiDAR, John Hagan, a leading ecologist in Maine, determined that the tree canopy over nearly 80% of the area is less than 35 feet tall and only 7% of the area has trees greater than 50 feet tall.

“The biggest problem with the NECEC proposal is that the 50,000 acres that NECEC selected contains almost no mature forest as typically recognized by both forest and wildlife ecologists – a fundamental requirement for the mitigation plan,” Sally Stockwell, then director of conservation for Maine Audubon, said in a Thursday news release.

But regulators said this week that the proposed land had enough “conservation value” to meet its standards. The DEP cited direct connections to 400,000 acres of conserved land, a lack of specific definitions for mature forest.

Opposition to the NECEC project is not new.

In 2021, Maine voters approved a referendum backed by environmental advocates to kill the project by making such transmission lines subject to approval by the state Legislature.

Combined, the sides spent more than $100 million during the campaign — setting a new spending record for a ballot question in Maine.

Years of legal challenges ensued.

First, CMP challenged the referendum itself, arguing retroactive application was unconstitutional and violated its due process and vested rights. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court agreed and allowed the project to move forward.

Then, environmental groups challenged a lease of about a mile of public land for the project, saying it constituted a substantial change to the land and therefore required a two-thirds majority of the Legislature. Maine’s high court again sided with Avangrid and allowed the lease.

Environmental groups also sued federal permitters over their environmental analysis of the transmission line. That challenge was rejected in April.

WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

With the final hurdle cleared, CMP plans to complete construction, testing and commissioning in the next month and a half.

The line is expected to begin operating by the end of the year.

CMP claims the project will lower energy costs for consumers in Maine by more than $14 million per year, and by more than $150 million in Massachusetts — where most of the energy will end up.

Environmental groups expressed concerns that Wednesday’s approval will set a dangerous precedent for future developments. The DEP’s decision to use specific species as indicators and adopt the “shifting mosaic” approach will harm species that need mature forests not just along this corridor, but in other areas, too, the groups said.

“For one of the highest-profile development projects in years, the DEP is saying for the purposes of compliance for this project — and this project only — we will define ‘mature forest habitat’ in a way that future regulators can ignore,” said Luke Frankel, a staff scientist at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. “This is not the way a state regulatory agency should operate. The way to avoid bad precedent is simple: don’t set it.”",https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/20211130_necec_20-1658353634.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-11-21 16:01:48.667526

The ""People's Transition Team,"" an initiative of the nonprofit Together New Orleans, will focus on four issue areas identified by city residents the group surveyed — cost of living, public works, jobs and energy.

Over the next two months before elected officials’ Jan. 12 inauguration, the organization will develop a plan for those officials to tackle the issues in their first 100 days in office.

In April, Together New Orleans plans to publish a report card, grading the mayor-elect and council members on their performance. The group said it has raised the funds needed to mail the report card to 50,000 registered voters.

At a press conference outside City Hall on Thursday, Shawn Anglim, a pastor at First Grace United Methodist Church and leader with Together New Orleans, said the old-fashioned approach, ""where you go cast a ballot, and then you go sit in the bleacher seats and you either boo or cheer your elected officials,"" hasn't worked.

""Together New Orleans has a second approach,"" he said. ""You gather 50-plus faith, unions, civic institutions deeply rooted in the city they love, and they get very, very clear about what they want to see change.""

The People’s Transition effort is a part of a broader push by Together New Orleans and its member institutions to ""do democracy differently"" and take on a more assertive role in shaping local government.

Its kick-off caps work that began in March 2024, when the organization’s delegates agreed to start a listening campaign to figure out the most pressing issues facing the city's residents. More than 1,500 people participated in small group meetings, and the organization eventually settled on the four focus areas.

In the coming months, four teams focused on the issue areas will develop a plan to teach the public about various problems and potential solutions. The teams will present the plan at various congregations, unions, schools and neighborhood groups next year.

The transition also plans to meet with subject matter experts to figure out what steps newly elected leaders can take in their first 100 days. They will then develop benchmarks that will form the basis of the scorecard.

""We asked one very important question: what is one thing our city needs to change?"" said Katie Jacob, a pastor at Grace Lutheran Church.

The work also comes after the group’s delegates in July ratified a ""People's Platform."" At an assembly in September, Moreno and six of the seven incoming council members vowed to support the platform. (Councilmember Lesli Harris, who ran unopposed, didn't attend the assembly.)

The platform calls for banning traffic camera tickets, rapidly fixing potholes, and paying city contractor invoices quickly, among other changes.

It also calls for the passage of a proposal pending before the city council to use $30 million from a settlement with Entergy to create battery-powered networks, or ""microgrids,"" across the city that would equip homes, small businesses, churches and other institutions with battery power walls. The proposal has faced opposition from Entergy, which argues the money would be better spent on its own resiliency programs.

Moreno, at a press conference Thursday, said she couldn't remember off the top of her head every aspect of Together New Orleans' platform, but that she ""fully supports"" Together New Orleans' microgrid proposal. The council is expected to vote on the proposal at a Dec. 10 committee meeting.

""One of the promises I made is that I would get this done before the end of my term,"" Moreno, who currently serves as council vice president, said. ""This is really transformative. It's a new, out of the box way of thinking. We would be leading on this climate initiative.""

Moreno gave an update on her own transition efforts on Thursday at New Orleans East Hospital, ahead of meeting of a transition committee focused on policy issues affecting New Orleans East and the Lower 9th Ward.

The mayor-elect said she wants to focus on retaining existing businesses — with dedicated personnel at City Hall to help address issues like utility bills and illegal dumping — while also pushing to recruit new businesses to the area.

She said her team is trying to ""untangle"" legal issues to help spur the redevelopment of the former Lake Forest Plaza site and that she wants the city to sell blighted property on Old Gentilly Road that once housed an incinerator.

Finally, she said she wants the redevelopment of the Six Flags site ""to move a lot faster,"" and that her administration plans to continue the work of the stalled New Orleans East Renaissance Plan, which Mayor LaToya Cantrell's administration put the brakes on earlier this year, by folding it into another ongoing study.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/46/146a0b2c-73cc-551c-a96b-793bb2117ddf/67f7ff05b4df0.image.jpg?crop=1779%2C934%2C0%2C115&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-21 14:01:48.184988

Although a possible buoy has been introduced to the BESS industry, the longevity of these projects remains uncertain. Additionally, with increased reports about a potential AI bubble, many are questioning whether it will eventually burst.

Regardless, companies are still taking advantage while they can.

In this case, OpenAI is teaming with Oracle and Related Digital on a 1GW data centre campus, Prevalon is teaming up with Emerson to provide data centre support, and EPC Power will provide ON.energy with power converters supporting data centre development.

OpenAI, Oracle, and Related Digital planning 1GWh data centre campus in Michigan

AI company, OpenAI, technology company Oracle, and data centre development firm Related Digital have announced plans to develop a data centre campus with over 1GW of capacity in Saline Township, Michigan.

The multi-billion-dollar investment in the project, expected to start construction in early 2026, is part of the previously announced partnership between OpenAI and Oracle to deliver an additional 4.5GW of Stargate capacity.

Michigan real estate office, The Perna Team, wrote of the project, “With over 1GW of computing capacity, the complex will draw an estimated 1.4GW of electricity at full tilt. Utility DTE Energy notes this is about 25% of its entire current power generation capacity, roughly equivalent to the output of a mid-sized nuclear reactor.”

This project has been dubbed The Barn, after a historic red barn on the site of the project.

The companies state that The Barn, financed by a group of prominent private investors and financial institutions, is expected to generate more than 2,500 union construction jobs.

Ongoing, Related Digital and Oracle expect to create more than 450 jobs onsite collectively, as well as 1,500 jobs county-wide, to support the project, along with thousands of indirect jobs across Michigan and the US.

The data centre campus will utilise a closed-loop cooling system, which Related Digital claims limits daily water use to levels comparable to an office building.

Utility DTE Energy is supplying 100% of the power to the project using existing resources augmented by a new battery storage investment, financed entirely by the project, in a way that “ensures no impact on DTE’s existing customers’ energy supply or rates.”

DTE further claims that its customers will benefit from the project, contributing its share to the fixed costs of maintaining and improving the grid.

Pending approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC), The Barn will consist of three 550,000 square-foot single-story buildings. It will be LEED certified.

Prevalon Energy partners with Emerson to support data centres

Dedicated BESS spin-out of Mitsubishi Power Americas, Prevalon Energy, and software and engineering firm Emerson are partnering to support hyperscale, colocation, and enterprise data centres.

The collaboration brings together Prevalon’s HD5 energy storage platform and insightOS energy management system (EMS) with Emerson’s Ovation automation platform.

Speaking with ESN Premium shortly after announcing insightOS, Prevalon’s president and CEO, Thomas Cornell, said:

“There’s a lot of buzz words — a lot of these control systems, they all share a lot of the same features, functions and benefits. But I think the things that really make our system stand out, and when I talk to our controls engineers, the number one thing they say, is that it works. It’s a very robust system, and it works.”

Through this teaming agreement, Prevalon and Emerson will collaborate to seek opportunities for integrating advanced control, automation, and energy storage systems for data center clients globally.

The companies will align their marketing, development, and customer engagement efforts to promote the adoption of new technologies in data center applications.

Cornell has also discussed Prevalon’s data centre ambitions in another interview with ESN Premium in September.

“They’re very large projects with different use cases for the batteries. The batteries on those are going to be anywhere from probably 500MW to 600MW with a two-hour duration.”

He continued, “The gas turbines are going to be at base load, so they’ll be fixed, but the data centre load swings based on the level of computing that’s going on, and the batteries are going to be there to pick up and match the load.”

In June, Prevalon’s 80MW/320MWh Happy Valley BESS entered commercial operations at utility Idaho Power’s Happy Valley battery storage project.

Earlier this year, the company signed a contract with Idaho Power for a 200MW/800MWh BESS. The agreement details long-term maintenance and remote monitoring services, with deployment scheduled for 2026.

EPC Power and ON.Energy partnering on grid-safe AI infrastructure

Manufacturer of power conversion systems EPC Power, and system integrator and project developer, ON.energy, have announced a strategic partnership seeing EPC supplying ON with power converters.

ON.energy will incorporate EPC Power’s hardware into its ‘AI UPS’ platform, capable of scaling from MWs to GWs and supporting runtimes of up to 8 hours.

EPC states that AI UPS is designed for hyperscale AI computing, safeguarding both grid-connected and off-grid systems by absorbing rapid AI transients and load fluctuations, while providing voltage and frequency ride-through capabilities that help speed up interconnection processes.

ON.energy began its journey in Latin America, specifically in the commercial and industrial (C&I) energy storage market, and has since expanded into the US, focusing on distributed and utility-scale portfolios.

ON.energy functions through two main business models. The first is as a system integrator and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC, not to be confused with the EPC Power) contractor, providing solutions to generators, third-party developers, and large corporations. Its primary focus is on C&I projects for critical infrastructure and data centres across six Latin American countries and Texas in the US.

The second is in leveraging its system integrator and EPC capabilities for its own project portfolios, which the company develops, builds, owns and operates in select US markets, predominantly for front-of-the-meter applications.

In January, ON.energy closed a US$77.6 million construction credit agreement with Pathward, NA and BridgePeak Energy Capital to build its 160MWh Palo de Agua BESS portfolio.

The portfolio, planned for development across Texas, encompasses the Poplar, Ft. Stockton, Mesquite, North Pecos, Colorado, Colorado 1, Andrews, Fathead 1, Fathead 2, and Badger BESS projects. All these BESS projects are anticipated to become operational sometime this year, each with a capacity of 9.9MW/20MWh.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/prevalon-emerson-pr-image2-en-gb-12034298.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 12:01:47.000637

That’s helped me in my term of student body president and at both of my internships,” he said.","Adolfo Alvarez ’26 went from not knowing if he was going to attend college to becoming UNC-Chapel Hill’s 2025-26 student body president.

As the University’s first Latino student body president, Alvarez embraces the challenge of representing his peers, bridging connections across campus and leadership, and ensuring that every student feels heard.

“I represent 32,000 people,” he said. “Serving as president gives me the chance to show up for students, to listen and to learn from them. I believe we’re stronger when we bring different perspectives together.”

Alvarez grew up in Guerrero, Mexico, and moved by himself to the United States when he was 16. As a high school senior, he lived alone and worked overtime at a QuikTrip gas station in Arizona to make ends meet.

At Carolina, Alvarez received a Carolina Covenant and a Wachovia Chancellor’s scholarships.

“I didn’t have much in the United States at the time; it was just me,” Alvarez said. “Carolina offered to pay for my education and had it all figured out for me. Carolina gave me everything.”

Alvarez is double-majoring in media and journalism at UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media and in global studies in the UNC College of Arts and Sciences. He has had summer internships with IHG Hotels and Resorts in Atlanta and the OneCarolina Summer Internship Program, where he got real-life experience in university development.

“In Hussman, we learn how to articulate things, how to communicate mass messaging and also balance the audiences you’re working with. That’s helped me in my term of student body president and at both of my internships,” he said. “Communication is such an important component of being in leadership.”

Since taking office, he has worked to improve communication between University administration and students. At the same time, he’s helping launch efforts like the Carolina Closet, a project to provide students with free access to professional attire for interviews, internships and job opportunities.

“By working with donors and campus partners, I hope to establish the Carolina Closet as a permanent resource, similar to a food pantry but focused on formal wear,” he said.

Since election night, Alvarez’s life catapulted into a state of constant busyness that he’s never experienced before. But he’s not fazed by it; he’s grateful.

“My life has changed a lot,” he said. “You go from being just a student to being a text away from the chancellor and serving on the UNC Board of Trustees and speaking at convocation and being on the stage at graduation. It’s such a privilege to represent so many people, and I’m genuinely excited because it gives me a reason to talk to everyone. If I see a random event on campus, even if I’m not sure I’m invited, I’ll show up and say, ‘Hey, everyone!’”

For Alvarez, serving as student body president isn’t just leadership, it’s gratitude in action, a way to honor the University that changed his life by devoting himself fully to the students he now represents.

“I always knew that I wanted to pay back everything the University gave me,” he said. “I came from an environment of uncertainty, and UNC only wanted me to worry about succeeding. I don’t see a better way to give back than representing the people, giving my energy and devoting my time to students. This opportunity is so full circle and exactly what I was hoping for, to give back to Carolina.”",https://www.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Adolfo_Hero-1.png,N,,2025-11-21 12:01:55.865703

With ARAQYS, Dcubed is positioning itself as the category leader in delivering affordable, scalable, and unlimited energy in orbit.

After SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and others transformed access to space through lower launch costs and increased capacity, a new generation of in-orbit applications — from data centers, high delta v transportation and direct-to-device communications to defense constellations — has emerged. Each shares a common challenge: a massive demand for affordable, scalable power.

ARAQYS addresses this by providing a full spectrum of space power solutions — from traditional deployable solar arrays to their proprietary in-space-manufactured KW solar array subsystems, and ultimately to Space Power Plants capable of beaming energy wherever it’s needed. This technology aims to dramatically reduce the cost per kilowatt, laying the groundwork for space infrastructure and directed-energy platforms of the future.

“Dcubed is fully committed to leading the next frontier: power generation in orbit,” said Dr. Thomas Sinn, CEO of Dcubed. “My involvement in a NASA NIAC study on space- based solar power more than 15 years ago set this journey in motion. Since then, we’ve been steadily developing the technologies required to make in-space energy a practical reality. With ARAQYS, we’re now combining those years of innovation into affordable large scale power solutions designed to meet the demands of the rapidly growing space economy.“

As the next step toward this vision, Dcubed announced the ARAQYS-D3 mission, which is manifested for launch in Q1 2027 aboard a SpaceX Rideshare mission. This mission will demonstrate a 2kW in-space-manufactured solar array with combined application cases in power-beaming and directed energy as well as demonstrating EP enabled high delta-v capabilities.

Collaboration between these European and American teams results in the ARAQYS-D3 satellite to be built by Astro Digital and Dcubed. This venture symbolizes transatlantic cooperation in advancing the next era of space systems. Astro Digital, a heritage spacecraft bus provider is located just a few miles from Dcubed’s American headquarters in Berthoud, Colorado.

The launch of ARAQYS-D3 is brokered by Maverick Space Systems, who will also provide launch management and integration services for the satellite. Maverick’s support will help Dcubed streamline the launch process, reduce risk, and allow us to focus on the ARAQYS-D3 mission.

“We’re excited to partner with Dcubed on this groundbreaking mission,” said Chris Biddy, CEO of Astro Digital. “The Araqys-D3 satellite will demonstrate how in-space manufacturing and large scale economic power generation can unlock a new class of small satellites—capable of generating, storing, and transmitting the energy required for the next generation of orbital missions.”

“We’re grateful to be supporting the launch of the ARAQYS-D3 mission,” said Roland Coelho, CEO of Maverick Space. “We see this as just the beginning of a close collaboration with Dcubed on future projects and developments.“

Dr. Sinn added: “It’s an honor to partner with Astro Digital and Maverick. This collaboration brings Europe and the United States closer together, uniting two space ecosystems to shape the future of satellite design and space power delivery.”

The production of the ARAQYS-D3 spacecraft and the ISM solar array will be conducted across Dcubed’s facilities in Munich, Germany, and Berthoud, Colorado, demonstrating the company’s bi-continental production capability and readiness for megawatt-scale manufacturing. The launch integration will be carried out by Maverick Space Systems form San Luis Obispo, California.

Paving the Way: ARAQYS-D1 and ARAQYS-D2

ARAQYS-D3 builds on two precursor missions that are already integrated and ready for launch on two separate SpaceX rideshare missions in Q1 2026:

Dcubed-1 (internally known as ARAQYS-D1) “BOOM! THERE IT IS”, a 3U satellite that will manufacture a 60 cm ISM boom directly in free space.

ARAQYS-D2 “WATTS NEW IN SPACE”, which will print and deploy a 1 m-long ISM solar array aboard Exotrail’s next SpaceVan mission.

These demonstrations will validate the building blocks of in-space power generation, paving the way for ARAQYS-D3’s multi-kilowatt-class system.

Dcubed is determining it’s next step after seven years of building capabilities and delivering over 1,500 flight-proven products to more than 120 customers across four continents, Dcubed is leveraging its deep heritage in deployable mechanisms to power the next phase of orbital industrialization.

Despite this year-over-year increase, Rhode Island has achieved a 19.5% reduction in emissions since 1990.
Continued progress on emissions requires coordination across states, federal agencies, utilities, and private industry.
The law requires Rhode Island achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and sets interim benchmarks for 2030 and 2040.
A detailed summary of the 2023 findings, including data sources is available in the 2023 Rhode Island Greenhouse Gas Inventory summary report at https://dem.ri.gov/ghg-inventory.","PROVIDENCE, RI – The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) announces a slight increase in the state’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2023. Statewide emissions rose to 9.52 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e), a 1.4% uptick compared to 2022. Despite this year-over-year increase, Rhode Island has achieved a 19.5% reduction in emissions since 1990. Continued progress on emissions requires coordination across states, federal agencies, utilities, and private industry.

The results come from DEM’s annual assessment of the state’s GHG emissions, the primary scientific tool used by the EC4 to track progress under the 2021 Act on Climate. The law requires Rhode Island achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and sets interim benchmarks for 2030 and 2040.

Notably, recent federal actions – including HR1 and related regulatory rollbacks that have drastically reduced federal funding for state and local energy programs and altered national clean-energy incentives – may affect the pace at which states can reasonably advance toward their climate goals.

As in past years, transportation (37%), residential buildings (19.6%), and electricity consumption (19.3%) were the state’s largest emission sources. A 5.1% jump in transportation emissions from 2022 levels, reflecting national trends of rising vehicle miles traveled, drove most of the overall increase.

Emissions from electricity-use were unchanged, because the electricity Rhode Island received from ISO New England was more carbon intense than in 2022. Residential building emissions declined 2.4% and commercial building emissions declined 5.3% from 2022 levels. 2023 marks the third consecutive year that residential and commercial building emissions have declined.

“This inventory provides a valuable scientific foundation for understanding where we stand,” said Governor Dan McKee. “As we look at the clean-energy landscape in 2025 and beyond, it’s undeniable that actions taken by the Trump Administration will fundamentally disrupt states’ long-term climate plans. The Trump administration’s rollback of clean-energy initiatives and its cuts to billions of dollars in funding have intentionally undermined the clean-energy future for states across the nation. As federal policies continue to shift, we will keep working with our partners to chart a practical and responsible path forward on reducing emissions.”

“Although the increase in emissions is disappointing, the rise in transportation emissions in 2023 follows national trends,” said DEM Director Terry Gray. “Despite the changing federal landscape – including reductions in federal clean-energy funding and the reversal of certain national clean-car and clean-energy standards – reducing our greenhouse gas emissions continues to be a priority across the EC4 agencies.”

Over the past five years, 2023 emissions decreased 5.4% below 2018 levels. Since 1990, transportation, residential buildings, and electricity consumption fell by 14%, 14.2%, and 30.6%. To meet the Act on Climate’s 2030 target (45% below 1990), Rhode Island must cut another 3.02 MMTCO2e (average of 4.5% per year) over the next seven years.

While federal policy changes in the OBBBA presented challenges to the industry, solar has proven to be one of the most cost-competitive sources of electricity, and is here to stay, the study finds.

IREC reports that the National Solar Jobs Census is based on a survey administered to tens of thousands of energy firms in 2024 and therefore does not reflect impacts of the OBBBA on the solar industry. Which was reported to have led to cancellation of over $6.7 billion in projects in June 2025 alone.

States with notable increases in job numbers occurred in what the report calls “Republican-leaning ‘red’ states: Ohio (5%), Georgia (4.5%), Utah (3.5%), and Texas (3%). See the state-specific solar employment numbers in IREC’s interactive map.

The expansion of battery energy storage was found to contribute to “significant job growth,” increasing 4% in 2024 and 17% in the five-year period between 2019 and 2024.

The census found that there are approximately 280,119 employed in the solar industry who focus primarily on solar, up slightly from the 2023 figure of 279,447. If you add in those who serve other industries as well, the number rises to over 370,000, IREC reports. Additionally it found that over 93,000 people focus primarily on battery energy storage, bringing the total to over 464,000 in solar and storage in 2024.

IREC concluded that he solar industry accounts for more jobs than any clean energy industry other than energy efficiency and employs more than three times more than the coal industry.

The Solar Jobs Census finds that the majority of people employed in solar are in the installation sector (64%). This sector includes construction workers and electricians, along with many other supporting roles, such sales, marketing, software, management, and

finance. With incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act for domestic manufacturing, the U.S. has seen strong growth in that sector; however, the manufacturing job number of 32, 491 does not reflect the strong growth because few new facilities were fully online by the end of the year.

The IREC report points to an estimate by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) that anticipates that if all the announced solar and storage facilities came online, manufacturing jobs will rise to 75,000 by the end of the decade. Analysts expect that domestic manufacturing will stall in future years with some facilities closing or being sold, due to changes in federal legislation under the Trump administration, the report notes.

Looking ahead

Growth in solar deployment skyrocketed In 2024, with the U.S. installing 50 GW of new solar capacity, which IREC notes is more than double the capacity installed two years before and nearly four times the amount in 2019. Jobs, however, have not increased by the same factor due to increased efficiency. For example, the report states that between 2010 and 2019, solar jobs increased by 167% with more than 150,000 jobs added. Then, in the five-year period between 2019 and 2024, solar jobs grew by 12% while installed solar capacity increased by 286%. The report attributes increased efficiency to larger installations as well as new technologies including digital scheduling tools, remote monitoring, modular components, and the recent launch of robots and AI.

In 2025, the Trump Administration and new Congress scaled back support for solar and other renewables in favor of fossil fuels, which the report expects to further discourage solar deployment. All is not lost; however, as IREC notes that the many benefits of solar and demand for excessive energy generation will keep solar competitive with other energy sources. The rush to install projects before tax credits expire will buoy the industry in the near term, and the report points to analyst estimates that solar deployment could be reduced by over 20% compared to projected growth before the legislation was enacted.

The report concludes that solar jobs numbers will remain steady in 2025 and jobs “will likely keep increasing in emerging industries like battery storage as well as in energy efficiency fields.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Fig-2-Segment.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:02:30.597725

The BLM received a single bid for a coal tract in the Montana portion of the Powder River Basin for an unprecedented fraction of a penny per ton of coal.
“It’s a sham,” Lynne Huskinson said of the notion that the Powder River Basin coal industry is being held back by the Biden-era leasing ban.

Mark Gordon cheered the effort to overturn the “misguided” coal leasing ban, noting the potentially long-lasting implications of using the review act.","Wyoming’s congressional delegation this week celebrated a major step toward invalidating the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Biden-era ban on new federal coal leasing in northeast Wyoming — home to one of the largest coal deposits and the most productive coal mines in North America.

But whether the effort will result in any new, major coal leases in the region is in doubt, and the congressional method to overturn the ban has infuriated conservation groups across the West who say it’s part of a larger GOP effort to upend decades of careful compromise to achieve “multiple use” on public lands.

Joint Resolution 130, introduced in October by U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso, passed the U.S. House and Senate this week. The measure would overturn the ban by employing the rarely used Congressional Review Act to invalidate the BLM’s Buffalo Field Office Resource Management Plan, which was updated in December.

Under the Biden administration, the BLM suggested the ban would have little impact on the flagging industry, which primarily provides fuel to the nation’s aging fleet of coal-fired power plants, noting coal mines in the region already have legal access to enough reserves to continue mining at the same pace beyond 2040.

But both Wyoming’s all-Republican congressional delegation and the Trump administration have pointed to unprecedented electrical demands for artificial intelligence and other data computations.

“The Biden administration’s relentless war on American energy was waged at every level, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, where it halted coal leasing,” Hageman wrote Tuesday on the social media platform X. “Passing H.J. Res. 130 will restore our national energy dominance, protect Wyoming jobs and prosperity and reassert Congress’s authority over an unchecked administrative state.”

Despite a bullish outlook and moderate upticks for the industry in recent months, a test run to resume leasing federal coal in the Powder River Basin failed — some say spectacularly — in October. The BLM received a single bid for a coal tract in the Montana portion of the Powder River Basin for an unprecedented fraction of a penny per ton of coal. Days later, the agency indefinitely postponed another coal lease auction on the Wyoming side of the basin.

“It’s a sham,” Lynne Huskinson said of the notion that the Powder River Basin coal industry is being held back by the Biden-era leasing ban.

Huskinson worked for decades as a Powder River Basin coal miner in Wyoming and serves as chair of the Sheridan-based landowner advocacy group Powder River Basin Resource Council. The $186,000 bid that Navajo Transitional Energy Company offered for the 167 million-ton federal coal tract in Montana was so low that it might not have even covered “a big repair on one of their motor graders,” she asserted.

Congress is using the CRA to override previously approved management plans elsewhere in the West. Because these plans are shaped by a formal public comment process, conservation groups say overriding them flies in the face of local input about how to best manage America’s public lands. It may even invalidate other uses permitted under BLM resource management plans, such as grazing and oil and gas leases, some conservation groups say.

“Senators heard one consistent message today: Multiple-use is hard,” Center for Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby said in a statement Thursday. “Finding the balance happens on the ground, with the residents, scientists and small-business owners who know the land the best. That’s why it’s so foolish for Congress to use a blunt instrument like the Congressional Review Act to impose land management decisions from Washington.”

Gov. Mark Gordon cheered the effort to overturn the “misguided” coal leasing ban, noting the potentially long-lasting implications of using the review act.

“When signed by the President, this action ensures that no future federal administration can authorize the large-scale termination of coal leasing in the area,” Gordon said in a prepared statement.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/coal-haul-trucks-belle-ayr-2025-dbleizeffer1763739875.jpeg?h=9a1378d6&itok=FG-iaTOs,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:40.911929

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.” “Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.
Targeting them in this roundabout way, that’s not a policy change that would’ve had majority support in Congress,” he said.","WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department said Thursday it plans to reclassify certain refundable tax credits as “federal public benefits,” which will bar some immigrant taxpayers from receiving them, even if they file and pay taxes and would otherwise qualify.

Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.

The Treasury Department’s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a ” whole of government ” approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government — not just Homeland Security — to come up with ways to help carry out the president’s hardline immigration agenda.

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.

For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance, even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits.

Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump’s broader policies.

“It’s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,” said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.

“Implementing this will require determining who has status and who doesn’t, which is another way that the Trump administration will expand its deportation dragnet.”

The final regulation is expected to apply beginning in tax year 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that “we are enforcing the law and preventing illegal aliens from claiming tax benefits intended for American citizens.” Treasury sought a Justice Department reinterpretation of the law in order to craft the new rule, the agency said.

Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said since people without work authorization already don’t qualify for these refundable tax credits, “the folks who are really going to be impacted are people who are really trying to do the right thing, the people authorized to work and paying their taxes.”

He said he believed the administration was trying to make the lives of taxpaying immigrants more difficult.

NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.”

“Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.

Davis said there probably wouldn’t be majority support for the move in Congress, which he said probably prompted the administration to act unilaterally on the issue instead.

Washington, D.C. – Today, Ranking Member Huffman pushed back against Republicans’ so-called SPEED Act, a sweeping bill that would gut core provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and rig the rules to fast-track polluter projects and silence Americans. Democratic members offered a series of amendments to the legislation that would lower costs, improve public health, support community input, prevent polluter handouts, and stop Trump’s attacks on cheap, clean energy sources.

Excerpts and Highlights from Ranking Member Huffman’s Opening Remarks

“American families are struggling right now to make ends meet. Trump's tariffs have raised prices on everything. Millions of Americans are about to lose affordable health care because Republicans don't have a plan to fix the crisis that they set in motion. The last thing our constituents need right now is higher utility bills because President Trump wants to stop new transmission lines and shut down an entire sector of clean energy that can help us deliver cheap, affordable electricity.”

""While the House was out of session this fall, Democrats met with companies and organizations across the spectrum to discuss this legislation. [And] across these conversations, there was agreement that NEPA provides important benefits: benefits that force the federal government to take a hard look and carefully consider alternatives and impacts, benefits that provide transparency, benefits that provide community input and engagement. These are important pillars of NEPA that, unfortunately, are undermined in deeply disturbing ways by the legislation before us today.""

“[T]he SPEED Act [treats] environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes. Weakening environmental review won't fix permitting challenges. It certainly won't help us build the clean energy future that we need. Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

War on Clean Energy

“Wind and solar projects across this country are being shut down by this administration with the approval of Congressional Republicans. We can't ignore that. It is an essential part of the context for any serious conversation in this space. Now, if President Trump and Secretary Burgum weren't illegally blocking wind and solar projects right now, firing permitting staff, cutting funding for agencies – we'd be having a very different conversation about permitting legislation.”

""Donald Trump is not always right, as you have watched him be terribly wrong on the Epstein files, as you've watched him be terribly wrong on redistricting and this race to the bottom that he set in motion. He's not always right. And so, I'm going to urge my colleagues across the aisle to summon your independence, summon a little bit of courage once again this week, and push back on this president when he is terribly wrong – and he is terribly wrong on clean energy right now.”

“This bill is so extreme that there's simply nothing left in a meaningful way of NEPA if this were to become law. Now, Democrats are very interested in working constructively in problem solving. We would love to have a meaningful conversation, but it has to start with ending the war on clean energy, which this bill does not do in any significant way.”

“The promise of American leadership in the green economy is being squandered. In effect, as China dominates the industries and jobs of tomorrow, we're locking ourselves into a fossil fuel stalemate when we should be taking advantage of the clean energy revolution. I will continue to say this: we can't have a real conversation about permitting reform until these attacks stop.”

“Over the past few months, the Department of Energy has terminated $7.6 billion in clean energy awards. Reports show that nearly $23 billion more is on the chopping block right now. Projects that would lower energy costs, strengthen the grid, and provide thousands of jobs. These are straightforward, beneficial investments that serve only to benefit the average American, and there is no rational explanation for targeting them. The only people benefiting are Big Oil billionaires.”

Public Health and Community Input

“This bill would prevent agencies from examining harms that communities across the country are living with right now. So, consider the poster child here: Louisiana's Cancer Alley, where predominantly black neighborhoods face some of the highest pollution related cancer risks in the nation. Those risks result from cumulative emissions from many facilities over decades, impacts that are well documented and directly tied to federal permitting decisions. And under this bill, agencies would be prohibited from considering those cumulative effects because they unfold over time and across multiple sources. That's not streamlining. That's telling federal agencies to look the other way in the face of an obviously foreseeable harm.""

""Agencies would be limited to analyzing only the alternatives that meet the applicant's preferred outcomes, and reasonable alternatives that would reduce environmental harm, lower costs, avoid impacts to communities, or better serve the public's interest, are excluded entirely by law. That is not reform. That is enabling biased analysis from the start. That is a thumb on the scale against the public.""

""This is an extreme and radical bill. [It’s] just chock full of these things that create an impossible gauntlet for people who are really hurt by bad projects and even illegal projects, from having any chance to challenge them. That is not an honest process. That is not a fine-tuning of NEPA. It's a dramatic, radical change to a law that protects the public.”

“[The] problem is the way the bill goes way too far in constraining environmental reviews, in eliminating, in some cases, transparency and public input. And we don't have to wonder what it looks like when you take away transparency, when you take away public input, when you make it impossible to stop a wrongheaded project that the federal government just decides to do, even if it's illegal, even if it's a crazy idea, when you make it impossible to scrutinize or stop that. We have a perfect example, and it is the East Wing of the White House right here. This is what happens when there's no transparency, when there's no scrutiny, when there's no input, when there's no way to stop a dumb idea from moving forward because you've done something like this to the NEPA process.”

Key Democratic Amendments

Huffman amendment #3 to prevent the bill from taking effect until clean energy grants such as offshore wind port grants that have been improperly rescinded by the Trump administration are reinstated and regulations are in place to prevent similar actions in the future.

Magaziner amendment #6 to clarify that renewable projects are recognized as legitimate multiple-use activities, planned responsibly, reviewed transparently, and coordinated with Tribes, states, fishermen, and local communities.

Ansari amendment #9 to amend the bill’s restrictions on the consideration of new science during much of the environmental review period. This amendment protects communities that would otherwise be put in harm’s way because an agency was forced to ignore new science about flooding, wildfire, pollution, or habitat collapse.

Rivas amendment #11 to ensure that NEPA’s public participation process is accessible and meets the needs of the community so people can have a voice in the decisions that affect their health, safety, and environment.

Rivas amendment #12 to add renewable energy to the list of national policies for the White House Council on Environmental Quality to foster and support.

Huffman amendment #13 to strike the provisions of the bill that dramatically narrows the definition of a “major Federal action” to exempt numerous projects from NEPA review and allow federal agencies to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on major infrastructure, energy, and environmental projects with no environmental review, no public input, and no accountability.

Grijalva amendment #14 to ensure that climate and environmental justice are included as national priorities pursued by the White House Council on Environmental Quality.

Min amendment #17 to repeal the Department of the Interior’s memo forcing all wind and solar energy projects through a permitting process that requires personal approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum at every stage of the permitting process, needlessly adding red tape to stall clean, affordable energy development.

Randall amendment #20 to exempt tribes from the bill’s restrictions that prevent them from getting judicial review, protecting their ability to challenge agency decisions that affect their lands, waters, cultural resources, and treaty obligations.

Randall amendment #22 to ensures that offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated by President Trump’s Big Ugly Bill still go through NEPA review.

Brownley amendment #24 to preserve meaningful accountability and ensure agencies correct significant errors before projects move forward.

Huffman amendment #26 to strike the provision that would prohibit agencies from considering cumulative effects of projects and foreseeable harm like pollution-related cancer risks.

Huffman amendment #28 to amend the judicial review section of the bill to ensure that federal agencies follow the law, listen to communities, and carefully consider the environmental and public-health consequences of their decisions.

What the So-Called SPEED Act Would Do

The SPEED Act would dramatically limit what federal agencies are allowed to consider when evaluating the environmental and public health consequences of major proposed projects, including climate and environmental justice impacts.

Bans the use of new scientific research or updated data that becomes available after a project is proposed—forcing agencies to ignore improved wildfire maps, updated climate models, or newly available health risk assessments.

Greatly limits what projects and actions can be reviewed under NEPA.

Limits public input and legal recourse to make it virtually impossible for communities to raise legitimate concerns or challenge flawed environmental reviews in court.

Tilts the standard for legal challenges even further away from impacted communities towards polluters while greatly limiting the ability of courts to take corrective action or provide relief.

Bipartisan Governor Letter Calls on Congress to Overhaul Energy Permitting

Thirteen governors of the bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA) issued a letter calling on Congress to move quickly on permitting reform. Led by Kevin Stitt (OK) and Josh Shapiro (PA), the governors warn that the U.S. risks falling behind countries like China if developers can’t build new infrastructure fast enough to meet rising power demand.

Their pitch ties the issue to some of the country’s biggest challenges, including keeping up in the AI race, bringing down energy costs for consumers, and upgrading the grid to be more resilient in the face of extreme weather. The governors argue that outdated approval processes are slowing down pipeline and transmission projects that could make energy more affordable and reliable.

A major part of their proposal centers on updating the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to study the environmental impacts of major projects before giving them the green light. Among the changes they’re suggesting is a cut to NEPA’s statute of limitations for lawsuits challenging agency decisions from six years to one year or less.

The bipartisan coalition is also calling for more authority for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, which are high-priority routes for expanding the electric grid and connecting new sources of clean energy.

News and Updates

California Stepping Up to Meet Emissions Cut Goals

California regulators are weighing big changes to the state’s carbon market to make polluting more expensive for companies and accelerate its progress towards climate goals. The California Air Resources Board, which runs the nation’s largest carbon market, is considering stricter rules, such as reducing the number of pollution allowances and cutting back on free permits for certain industries. These changes would raise costs for emitters and encourage cleaner practices.

The move supports California’s goal to cut emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2045. A new law signed this year also extended the carbon market’s lifespan to 2045, ensuring it remains a key tool in reducing California’s carbon footprint.

Exxon Lawsuit Challenges Climate Disclosure Update

As California is tightening pressure on big polluters, Exxon Mobil is suing the state, asserting that reporting requirements unfairly target fossil fuel producers and violate the First Amendment.

California’s new climate disclosure laws, known as S.B. 253 and S.B. 261, will require corporations with over $1 billion in revenue to disclose their supply-chain emissions starting in 2026. Those making over $500 million will also be required to biennially report financial risks tied to climate change, including impacts from climate-related natural disasters on business operations, financial standing, and investments.

Business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed similar lawsuits last year. A federal judge has refused to block the laws noting “plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on [their] merits” tied to the First Amendment, but this case is currently on appeal in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

What they’re saying: “November’s results reflect another notable—yet anticipated—decline in the new-vehicle sales pace, driven largely by the pull-ahead of electric vehicle (EV) purchases prior to the expiration of federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30,” said Thomas King, president of OEM solutions at J.D. Power.

“That expiration prompted many shoppers to accelerate buying decisions, resulting in a surge in EV sales that temporarily inflated the overall industry sales pace,” he added.

Why it matters: The slowdown reflects a timing shift from the EV pull-ahead, not a demand collapse, leaving dealers with tougher year-over-year comps and a cooler sales pace. Stores will need to lean into the right mix (ICE, hybrids, value models), tighter inventory discipline, and creative deal structures to protect volume and profitability.

Between the lines: With the EV rush and federal incentives in the rearview, the average manufacturer incentive spend was higher than October but still lower than a year ago—as more sales shift toward internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, with trucks and SUVs driving transactions.

The average OEM incentive spend per vehicle is on track to reach $3,211, up $375 from October—but $125 lower than a year ago.

Leasing is expected to decline 2.7 percentage points from November 2024, reaching 20.5% of total sales, while leases still account for 54% of EV transactions.

ICE vehicles are projected to account for 77.5% of new retail sales, up 2.3 percentage points from a year ago—while EVs are expected to account for 6.0% of sales, down 3.6 percentage points.

Trucks and SUVs are on track to account for 82.6% of new-vehicle retail sales, up 1.0 percentage point from November 2024.

Affordability continues to weigh on new-vehicle sales, with the average new retail transaction price at $46,029, up $722 year-over-year, and the average monthly payment surging to $760—a record for November.

Bottom line: The easy lift from EV tax credits is gone, and the market is settling into a slower, more normal run rate where ICE trucks/SUVs and hybrids do the heavy lifting. Dealers are back to blocking-and-tackling—finding ways to move metal in a payment-stretched market without relying on outsized incentives or policy tailwinds.

“If there was ever a time the people of Louisiana needed to stand for something, it is now,” he said.
“They better wake up.” Representatives from 10 Louisiana parishes, including Allen, Calcasieu, Cameron and Vernon were in Baton Rouge on Thursday to support the filing of the lawsuit.","A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of state laws granting eminent domain power for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects has been filed against the State of Louisiana.

The 43-page suit was filed on Thursday in the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish by Save My Louisiana, Inc., and several individual property owners, including Col. (Ret) Mark T. Guillory, Horace Johnson Jr., Louis Robertson, Pamela and Bradford Belgrad, Reggie Rice and David K. Woodham.

The defendants are the state of Louisiana. the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson, and Gov. Jeff Landry.

The plaintiffs are seeking to strike down the special laws granting eminent domain power to private companies and to cease all permitting and regulatory actions related to injection wells.

Save My Louisiana, a nonprofit advocacy group, contends that a series of special laws passed since 2020 violate citizens’ constitutional protections by granting private CCS companies the special privilege of eminent domain, allowing the expropriation of private property for private gain. The suit cites violations of multiple sections of the Louisiana Constitution.

“We hope to prove that our constitutional rights have been violated, and hope that the courts acknowledge that it has been violated,” said Mike Slocum, a member of Save My Louisiana, in a phone interview with the American Press. “We own our land, we have the right to liberty and property according to the Constitution, and that has been violated when you give industry the right to use eminent domain for private gain.”

Slocum noted the state has granted eminent domain rights to both foreign and domestic industry, which is a key concern.

“If there was ever a time the people of Louisiana needed to stand for something, it is now,” he said. “They better wake up.”

Representatives from 10 Louisiana parishes, including Allen, Calcasieu, Cameron and Vernon were in Baton Rouge on Thursday to support the filing of the lawsuit.

In a press release, Col. (Ret) Mark T. Guillory, of Save My Louisiana, stated, “We are petitioning the Judicial Branch to review these laws and establish that they are indeed in violation of the Constitution of Louisiana and that they be struck from the law thereby restoring Louisiana’s fundamental Right to Property.”

Guillory claims prior attempts to petition the legislative and executive branches to correct the “egregious and overt trampling of Constitutional guarantees and protections” were unsuccessful, noting that the authorization for the CCS industry to utilize eminent domain remains in full force under state law. specifically citing RS 10, Sec 2, paragraphed 10 and 11 and RS 30:1108, A I1.

He further criticized legislators for creating the situation, stating, “Legislators have offered excuses for this massive failure stating that they either didn’t read or understand the bills that created this situation yet still they voted for them.”

He said it was not until Save My Louisiana and others like it discovered the treachery of negligence that legislators began working to correct the situation. He added that the “anemic half-measures” offered to correct the situation seem to be “more like threading a needle to placate citizens with a false sense of security while protecting the carbon capture and sequestration industry’s right to exercise eminent domain.”

The plaintiffs also object to the governor’s executive order citing a “Landowner Bill of Rights for Geological Sequestration Projects” created by the same laws, arguing that new laws cannot make property taking less restrictive than the constitutional guarantees citizens already possess.

The lawsuit comes as over 33 applications for Class V test well and Class VI injection well projects have been permitted or are seeking final approval, with many located in Allen, Vernon and Rapides parishes.",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/04/Carbon-capture.png,N,,2025-11-21 12:02:18.637260

According to new job listings for “Rental Readiness Specialists” spotted today, Tesla is launching rental operations in Austin, Nashville, Boston, Fort Worth, and Houston.

This marks the first major expansion of the program outside of its initial pilot locations in San Diego and Costa Mesa. By hiring its own fleet management staff, Tesla is bypassing traditional rental agencies like Hertz—who have notably pulled back on their EV ambitions—to control the entire customer experience directly.

The Deal: Undercutting the Competition

Tesla’s pricing structure is designed to undercut traditional rental counters while showcasing its high-margin software features. The confirmed pricing tiers for the new locations are:

Model 3 & Model Y: $60/day

Cybertruck: $75/day

Model S & Model X: $90/day

“Rent a Tesla and see how it makes every errand, commute, and road trip more fun,” the program’s landing page states.

But the real value lies in the perks, which effectively make this a subsidized test drive:

Unlimited Mileage: No caps on distance.

Free Supercharging: Fuel is completely on the house.

FSD (Supervised) Included: Renters get full access to Tesla’s $8,000 Full Self-Driving software.

Purchase Incentive: A $250 credit toward a new Tesla if you buy within 7 days of your rental.

The Strategy: A “Paid Test Drive”

This program is a direct response to the harsh reality of the post-tax credit market. Since the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30, 2025, automakers have scrambled to find new demand levers.

Tesla’s solution is to monetize its inventory while aggressively marketing its software. A standard 30-minute test drive rarely converts a skeptic, but a week-long rental with free charging and self-driving capabilities might. By offering the Cybertruck at just $75/day, Tesla is also turning its most polarizing vehicle into an accessible novelty for weekend trips, potentially broadening its appeal beyond early adopters.

EVXL’s Take

This expansion is a brilliant, if necessary, pivot. Tesla is solving three problems at once: moving stagnant inventory, generating service revenue, and collecting real-world data for its autonomy network.

Most importantly, this looks like the early infrastructure for the Tesla Network. As we reported during the “We, Robot” event in October 2024, Musk’s end-game is a fleet of autonomous Robotaxis. By building the logistics muscle now—hiring “Rental Readiness Specialists” to clean, charge, and manage a fleet—Tesla is quietly rehearsing for the day those cars rent themselves out without a driver.

Furthermore, this vertical integration mirrors the manufacturing efficiency analysts have praised. As noted in previous coverage of how Tesla could revolutionize U.S. manufacturing, Tesla’s ability to insource complex operations gives it a massive cost advantage. If Tesla can successfully run a national rental network, they aren’t just an automaker; they become the operator of the world’s largest distributed transportation utility.

Expect this program to launch in every major U.S. metro by Q1 2026. As traditional rental giants struggle with EV depreciation, Tesla will step in to own the entire vertical, eventually transitioning these “rental” fleets into the first wave of the Cybercab network.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_8985-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 09:59:43.673047

Once completed, the project will generate enough clean, domestic electricity to power more than 24,000 homes, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2026.

Developed, owned, and operated by Arevon, the project represents nearly US$200 million in private investment and is Arevon’s first utility-scale solar development in the state. Formerly known as Campbell Solar, the project was renamed Big Muddy Solar in recognition of the river that flows through Jackson County, and its new logo features an outline of Murphysboro’s well-known Big Muddy Monster as a tribute to local identity and heritage.

The Big Muddy Solar Project will play an important role in meeting America’s growing demand for affordable, reliable clean energy while also delivering long-term economic benefits to the region. Over its lifetime, the project is expected to generate more than US$12.6 million in property tax revenue, supporting local schools, public safety services, and community infrastructure.

Arevon has partnered with Signal Energy for construction, which will employ more than 250 workers, including members of local labor organizations such as IBEW Local 702, IUOE Local 318, and the Laborers’ International Union of North America Local 773. As construction continues, additional spending at local hotels, restaurants, shops, and service providers will further support the Jackson County economy. The project is backed by a long-term virtual power purchase agreement with an American multinational technology company.

Environmental stewardship is central to Arevon’s development approach, and Big Muddy Solar reflects this commitment. Alongside generating secure, homegrown renewable energy, the project will convert the land beneath and around its panels into a pollinator-friendly habitat, promoting healthy soil and supporting essential pollinator species. This dual-use approach enhances local biodiversity while ensuring responsible, sustainable project operations.

Arevon hosted a milestone event on November 18 to commemorate construction progress and recognize the company’s substantial investment in Jackson County’s energy future. The event brought together public officials, community leaders, business representatives, landowners, and other partners. Speakers included Arevon CEO Kevin Smith, Jackson County Board Chairman C.J. Calandro, Murphysboro Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Dawn McClerren, Regional Superintendent of Schools Matthew Hickam, Jackson Growth Alliance Chairman Brian Chapman, and Illinois State Police Special Agent Justin Haney, who also serves as Coordinator for the Team Illinois Youth Police Camp. Arevon Development Manager Jemma King served as the Master of Ceremonies.

Kevin Smith emphasized the project’s long-term value for the community, noting that Big Muddy Solar will deliver reliable clean energy while creating economic opportunities through jobs, tax revenue, and community partnerships. Dawn McClerren expressed appreciation for Arevon’s ongoing reinvestment in Jackson County, highlighting the benefits for families, schools, and local organizations.

As the long-term owner and operator of Big Muddy Solar, Arevon is committed to supporting community development throughout the life of the project. The company focuses its giving efforts on education, food and housing security, and public health and safety. In Jackson County, Arevon has already partnered with numerous organizations, including the Elverado and Murphysboro Education Foundations, Junior Achievement, Future Farmers of America, the 4-H Council, the Southern Illinois University Carbondale STEM Education Research Center, SPARK 618, Victory Dream Center, Murphysboro Food Pantry, 724 Ministries, Carbondale Warming Center, Revitalize 62966, local volunteer fire departments, the Jackson County Ambulance Service, and the Perry-Jackson Child Advocacy Center.

Local partners praised the company’s support, with leaders noting that Arevon’s contributions are helping expand STEM education opportunities, strengthen youth programs, and address urgent food insecurity across the region. Arevon is continuing to grow its renewable energy portfolio across the Midwest. The company recently began operations at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Indiana, representing a combined investment of US$400 million and 264 MWdc of new solar capacity. It is also constructing the US$500 million, 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri.

In addition, Arevon developed and managed construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project for NIPSCO and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project for Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company, ensuring successful integration of each project into its respective community. Arevon continues to advance development of additional renewable energy facilities throughout the region, strengthening the supply of clean energy and supporting long-term economic growth.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/26-1.png,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:58.895470

The deployment of EV charging stations are accelerating energy sovereignty across Upper Midwest tribal nations. Through a partnership between Native Sun Community Power Development Inc. and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI), smart electric vehicle charging infrastructure and related renewable energy technologies will be deployed across the region.

The initiative supports electrification and renewable energy adoption in tribal communities, while laying the foundation for future opportunities including microgrids, distributed energy resources, and energy market integration.

“We at Native Sun are fighting a human health crisis on tribal lands, and we believe renewable energy and electrification can help cure this problem,” said Robert Blake, executive director of Native Sun. “Technology and Native determination is what enables us to do this, and to empower our communities to be leaders in the clean transportation and energy space. To be able to partner with OATI on this important project, and gain so much more than a solutions provider, has been critical to our success and impact.”

Native Sun is a Minnesota-based nonprofit that has entered the final phase of deployment for its pioneering Electric Nation program. Building on agreements the organization has made with tribal nations across the Upper Midwest, OATI, through its subsidiary EVolution, will provide the EV charging infrastructure, smart charging software platform, and customer support necessary for tribal communities to have reliable charging options for their electric vehicles.

EV charging installation

The two companies are coordinating the installation of the EV charging infrastructure for these tribal nations. Once installed, each Tribe will own their station outright, along with extended warranty service for long-term ownership and benefit. The the EVolution EV charging platform provides:

Smart EV charging stations in multiple form factors and kW / MW power capacity.

A secure, cloud-hosted Smart Charge Station Network Management System (NMS).

A robust EV driver mobile app.

Full professional services for rollout and ongoing operations.

24/7 support for reliability and customer service.

With the EVolution NMS hosted in the OATI Cloud, designed specifically for mission-critical energy applications, tribal nations gain access to industry-grade security and reliability that also support data sovereignty.

“Tribal nations continue to drive the energy transition by investing in the electrification, reliability, and resilience tools critical to supporting their communities and expanding economic opportunities,” said Sasan Mokhtari, president and CEO of OATI. “OATI is honored to partner with Native Sun to bring these valuable solutions to tribes in support of their energy sovereignty goals, and in providing clean technology leadership in rural and remote communities”

The program’s impact extends beyond deploying chargers. OATI can provide tribes with further consultation, design, and planning services for development of microgrid projects, which offer community resilience and additional revenue streams, like energy market integration and the potential for commercial development from manufacturing and data center facilities. These technologies will help buffer the unreliable electrical service that can occur in these communities and provide options to mitigate the cost of “demand charges” that can spike the utility bills tied to EV chargers and other electrical demands.

Wright is correct about one thing: Renewable energy investment is extremely popular.
Meanwhile, the future of both economic opportunity and public health depends on accelerating the shift to clean energy.
CLAIM: “Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.” REALITY: There’s no such thing as “clean coal.” Coal remains the dirtiest, most polluting energy source.
What’s actually essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and the AI boom is reliable, affordable, and scalable clean energy, the very renewables the second Trump administration is trying to kneecap.","CLAIM: “Wind and solar, the darlings of the last administration and so much of the world today, supply roughly 3 percent of global primary energy.”

REALITY: Wind and solar now supply about 8 percent of total world energy use, more than double Wright’s number. And that percentage is growing fast. Wind and solar contributed 40 percent of the global energy increase in 2023, making it the largest source of new energy in the world, while the energy think tank Ember estimates that renewables provided about one-third of global electricity generation in 2024. They also topped coal to become the world’s largest source of electricity in the first half of 2025—the first time that this has happened.

The transition in the United States is well underway as well. Coal once provided half the electricity nationally; now it’s down to about 16 percent, below that of renewable energy. Renewables also accounted for 96 percent of new power capacity in 2024 and are on track to surge again this year. Even with this administration’s attacks on clean energy, the United States is forecast to add 395 gigawatts of new wind, solar, and storage between 2025 and 2030.

Wright is correct about one thing: Renewable energy investment is extremely popular. As this recent International Energy Agency report points out, “clean electricity investment ‘towers above’ fossil fuel sources by 12:1 in the advanced economies, by 6:1 in China, and by 2:1 in other emerging markets and developing economies.” Global solar investment reached $252 billion in the first half of 2025 while wind reached $126 billion, with offshore wind accounting for most of the increase over the last year. Meanwhile, oil and gas demand projections for the future continue to reflect hubris, not reality. The transition to renewables is happening; the only question is whether the Trump administration will support it or needlessly (and recklessly) fight it.

CLAIM: “Everywhere wind and solar penetration have increased significantly, prices on the grid went up and stability of the grid went down.”

REALITY: Renewable energy is now the cheapest source of electricity generation, and it’s delivering lower prices and more reliable power. A recent POLITICO analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data found that of the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices.

Texas has the fastest-growing deployment of solar and storage, and analysts say that’s one reason prices have not spiked there. As the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas concluded in its report on how Texas electricity prices were moderated in 2024: “Another hot summer in Texas put the electric grid to the test, but increased capacity from solar and battery storage met the call.” Just this past summer, energy use in Texas shot up, but power prices declined, mostly due to record generation from solar and storage, according to Texas grid expert Doug Lewin.

Meanwhile, unsubsidized utility-scale solar and onshore wind remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation.

In terms of reliability, recent grid instability has been driven largely by failing gas plants. During the catastrophic Texas freeze of 2021 (Winter Storm Uri) and the Christmas storm across the mid-Atlantic in 2022 (Winter Storm Elliott), gas systems repeatedly froze and caused blackouts.

During Winter Storm Elliot, for example, natural gas plants accounted for more than 70 percent of all unplanned outages across the mid-Atlantic grid. As Arctic air swept through the Midwest in January 2025, wind and solar kept the grid from failing. And experts say that solar with storage played a significant role in maintaining grid stability under intense heat conditions this past summer. In Texas, wholesale energy prices fell more than 70 percent between summer 2023 and summer 2024, specifically linked to the growth of solar and battery storage.

In short, wind and solar have helped strengthen grid resilience and reduce costs in many regions across the country.

CLAIM: “Coal transformed our world and made it better, extended life expectancy, and grew opportunities, and coal globally will be the largest source of electricity for decades to come. That’s not a policy, that’s not a desire, that’s just a reality.”

REALITY: Coal did help power the Industrial Revolution, but it also choked cities in smog, poisoned our water supply, and fueled the climate crisis we’re now trying to address. Beginning in the early 1970s, the United States started curbing the sulfur dioxide and other pollutants spewing from coal plants, delivering tremendous public health benefits and preventing widespread damage from acid rain. And now, clean, cheaper energy sources have already surpassed coal globally, so the assertion that it will be the world’s largest power source for the foreseeable future is already incorrect. Even in China, long seen as coal’s final stronghold, coal now plays a diminishing role.

Wright himself implicitly acknowledges coal’s diminished importance. The day the administration announced new measures to prop up coal, Wright said on Fox Business that coal should remain 15–16 percent of the power on the grid. That’s about where it is now—a far cry from the more than 50 percent of electricity it delivered about two decades ago.

Ultimately, the United States clinging to coal isn’t “realism”; it’s regression. Coal is not bouncing back. The only question is what the timeline of its decline will look like. Meanwhile, the future of both economic opportunity and public health depends on accelerating the shift to clean energy.

CLAIM: “Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”

REALITY: There’s no such thing as “clean coal.” Coal remains the dirtiest, most polluting energy source. It has the highest emissions intensity among fossil fuels and is responsible for deadly toxic air and water contamination. Coal also cannot compete. No new coal plant has been built in the United States in more than a decade; where it was once by far the largest source of electricity, it now sits fourth behind gas, renewables, and nuclear.

What’s actually essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and the AI boom is reliable, affordable, and scalable clean energy, the very renewables the second Trump administration is trying to kneecap. By blocking investments in solar, wind, storage, and grid modernization, the administration isn’t fueling innovation; it’s sabotaging progress to protect coal and fossil fuel interests, at the expense of American competitiveness.

CLAIM: “There are no oil and gas subsidies. In the United States, oil and gas and coal are huge taxpayers and don’t have any subsidies that I’m aware of. And I’ve been in the business for 40 years. So, if you can find the subsidies, tell me where they are.”",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:23.677914

That amplifies U.S. influence and undermines a faster energy transition, he added.
In that context, he said, the presence of U.S. states, cities, universities and advocacy groups at COP30 is much more than just symbolic.","BELÉM, Brazil—On the penultimate day of COP30, with nearly 200 countries close to finalizing a global roadmap toward a fossil fuel phase out, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres had a simple message for President Donald Trump and the United States: “We are waiting for you.”

Despite the absence of formal representation from the federal government at the annual climate talks, the country’s influence is still felt. Victor Menotti, interim U.S. coordinator with the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice, likened the country’s presence to that of a ghost in the global climate machine.

Several senior U.S. climate diplomats from previous administrations attended COP30, including Todd Stern, Sue Biniaz and Trigg Talley, who all helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. As the U.S. State Department’s lead climate lawyer for more than 25 years, Biniaz guided U.S. legal strategy through decades of international negotiations, culminating in a key role in shaping the Paris Agreement. Talley worked on climate issues at the State Department for nearly 20 years and served as director of the Office of Global Change, coordinating climate efforts across federal departments and agencies.

They attended to facilitate communication between the “We Are Still In” coalition, which brings together U.S. states, cities, businesses and universities committed to climate action despite federal policy shifts.

Stern, a former U.S. special envoy, was instrumental in shaping U.S. climate policy from 2009 to 2016 and helped negotiate the Paris Agreement, the most significant outcome of the 33-year United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process. His participation in this year’s talk is evidence of the United States’ enduring influence in a process the Trump administration has rejected, said Menotti, adding that the U.S. still wields power through elite continuity and back-channel influence.

“The U.S. is still shaping what happens in these rooms, even without a delegation,” said Menotti, who has attended 10 climate summits, trying to bring the concerns of nonprofit climate advocacy groups to the negotiating table. “Nobody from the U.S. needed to show up here, and you would still have that big impact.”

That influence is evident far from the United Nations climate negotiation rooms, he added. For example, as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met last June in Bonn, Germany, to set the stage for COP30, Trump pushed NATO countries to increase their military spending, which sucked the air out of discussions to increase public climate financing, a key agenda item in Belém.

That push, along with the U.S.’s expansion of fossil fuel production and its pressure on allies to buy more fossil gas, has made developing countries uneasy, Menotti said. It also reinforces the perception that developed countries are evading their commitments to reduce emissions faster than developing countries.

Long-time U.S. allies who say they want to advance climate action are still feeding demand for U.S. fossil fuels. That amplifies U.S. influence and undermines a faster energy transition, he added.

In the end, Menotti said, the “ghost” in the COP machine is not just the presence of former U.S. diplomats, but the enduring grip of fossil fuel power.

“There’s the fossil fuel industry, which is global, and central to American industrial, military, financial power,” he said. “The U.S. government, under any administration, is the expression of that power.”

States, Cities and Businesses Step Up

While the U.S. federal government is currently the face of fossil fuel power, members of Congress, governors and business leaders are more pragmatic and want to stay engaged with global climate action, said Lou Leonard, dean of the School of Climate, Environment, and Society at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.

“It’s really important for other governments to see the nuance of how we do things in the United States, that climate action is still happening, even when the federal government isn’t here,” said Leonard, who, in 2021, helped launch the “America Is All In” coalition, a precursor to “We Are Still In.”

“You don’t want other governments using the U.S. failure as an excuse to move back, and you certainly don’t want countries walking out and the multilateral process collapsing,” he said.

Leonard said COP is not just about negotiating global rules, but also about generating momentum that pushes governments, businesses and institutions to deliver real-world climate action.

With the rules of the Paris Agreement largely settled, the role of COP as a catalyst for implementation has become more crucial. In that context, he said, the presence of U.S. states, cities, universities and advocacy groups at COP30 is much more than just symbolic. It offers a way to keep climate progress moving despite absent or hostile federal leadership.

An agreement reached during COP30 between California and Baden-Württemberg to share tools for boosting solar power, protecting water supplies from heatwaves and floods and rolling out clean-tech jobs is proof that U.S. states can flex some climate muscle even without the federal government, Leonard said.

The coalition represents a significant share of the U.S. economy, with participating states accounting for roughly 55 percent to 60 percent of the country’s economic activity, alongside hundreds of cities, businesses and institutions pursuing climate action, Leonard said. Efforts to boost renewable energy, reduce sprawl and other measures by states, cities and businesses could cut U.S. emissions by more than 50 percent by the mid-2030s, even without federal direction.

That still falls short of what’s needed for rapid global decarbonization, but he said it remains critical for sustaining momentum and signaling continued U.S. engagement to the international community.

Is the U.S. Still Climate Spying?

There’s another, far less-visible form of American power that has long shaped the global climate landscape from behind the scenes: control over climate knowledge, said Rachel Santarsiero, director of the National Security Archive’s Climate Change Transparency Project.

For decades, the U.S. intelligence community has tracked climate change as a matter of national security by collecting satellite data through spy satellites, classified assessments and other operations, including reportedly spying on the negotiations at COP15 in Copenhagen, first revealed via Wikileaks.

All that information could help protect vulnerable countries, but remains tightly controlled, giving the U.S. influence over what the rest of the world learns about climate change and what remains hidden.

Santarsiero stressed that while there is no public way to verify active intelligence operations at COP30, it would be unrealistic to assume that the U.S. intelligence community is not monitoring the talks.

“It seems like it would be part of the conversation that the intel community is having,” she said. “Even if climate is not an administration priority, you have to think that something like a phase-out of fossil fuels is going to be in tension with what the administration is trying to do.”

Historically, such monitoring has often been intended to inform diplomacy. Intelligence agencies have long provided environmental data and assessments so negotiators would be better prepared to understand risks, anticipate instability and plan for long-term security implications, helping governments respond to climate threats.

While the COPs are often seen as a neutral space where countries work together, she said, they are also a time when major powers work to protect their interests and shape outcomes.

She said it’s impossible to separate COP30 from U.S. energy and geopolitical strategy, pointing to the administration’s push to expand coal, oil and gas production even as negotiators pressed for a fossil fuel phase-out.

“You have to think that something like a phase-out of fossil fuels is going to be in tension with what the administration is trying to do … I mean, it all leads back to U.S. competition,” she said. That means the U.S. remains embedded in the COP process, not as a stakeholder at the table, but as a strategic actor guarding its national interests.

U.S. influence on the U.N. climate talks hasn’t vanished. It’s just more diffuse and difficult to see. Even without a flag on the dais, the U.S. is still defending its markets, pressuring other countries on their energy policies and evaluating intelligence reports far from the plenary floor.

“It would be naive to pretend that’s not happening,” Santarsiero said. “These things aren’t necessarily sinister… it’s just another facet of these negotiations.”

Electric vehicles cost more upfront than gas-powered cars. The average new EV sells for $53,469 according to Kelly Blue Book data from 2023. Compare this to $48,763 for the average new gas vehicle. That’s a $4,706 difference before you even factor in other costs.

However, federal tax credits help close this gap. The Inflation Reduction Act offers up to $7,500 in tax credits for new EVs that meet specific requirements. Used EVs can qualify for up to $4,000. But these credits come with strings attached:

The vehicle must be assembled in North America

Battery components must meet domestic sourcing requirements

Your income cannot exceed certain limits ($150,000 for single filers, $300,000 for joint filers)

The vehicle price cannot exceed $55,000 for cars or $80,000 for SUVs and trucks

Many popular EVs don’t qualify for the full credit or any credit at all. Check the IRS website before counting on this savings.

Home Charging Installation Costs

Your standard 120-volt wall outlet charges an EV extremely slowly, about 3 to 5 miles of range per hour. This works only if you drive very little and can charge overnight every single night.

Most EV owners need a Level 2 charger that runs on 240 volts, the same power that runs your clothes dryer. Installing this system involves several costs:

The Charger Unit: Quality Level 2 chargers cost between $300 and $1,200. Basic models work fine, but smart chargers let you schedule charging during cheaper electricity rate hours.

Electrical Panel Upgrades: Many homes need panel upgrades to handle the extra electrical load. Older homes with 100-amp or 150-amp panels often require upgrades to 200-amp service. This costs between $1,500 and $3,000.

Installation Labor: Licensed electricians charge $500 to $2,000 for installation depending on how far your garage sits from your electrical panel and whether they need to run new wiring through walls.

Permits and Inspections: Local building codes require permits for electrical work. Budget $100 to $500 for permits and inspection fees.

Total home charging setup typically costs $2,000 to $5,000. Some utility companies offer rebates that reduce these costs by $250 to $1,000.

Electricity Costs vs. Gasoline Savings

EV advocates focus heavily on fuel savings. The math does favor electric vehicles, but the savings vary widely based on where you live and when you charge.

The average EV uses 0.34 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per mile according to the Department of Energy. With national average electricity rates of $0.16 per kWh, driving costs about $0.05 per mile.

A gas car averaging 30 mpg with gas at $3.50 per gallon costs about $0.12 per mile. This creates savings of $0.07 per mile, or $700 annually if you drive 10,000 miles.

However, electricity rates vary dramatically by location:

Hawaii: $0.42 per kWh

California: $0.30 per kWh

Louisiana: $0.09 per kWh

Washington: $0.11 per kWh

Time-of-use rates also matter. Charging during peak hours can cost twice as much as overnight charging. Smart EV owners charge between 11 PM and 7 AM when rates drop.

Public charging stations cost significantly more than home charging. DC fast chargers charge $0.40 to $0.60 per kWh, nearly triple home rates. Frequent road trippers lose much of their fuel savings advantage.

Insurance Costs Run Higher

Insurance companies charge more to cover electric vehicles. Industry data shows EV insurance costs average 25% higher than comparable gas vehicles.

Several factors drive higher premiums:

Expensive Repairs: EV-specific parts cost more and require specialized technicians. Fewer repair shops have trained EV mechanics and proper equipment.

Battery Replacement Risk: Insurance companies worry about battery damage in accidents. A replacement battery pack costs $5,000 to $20,000 depending on the model.

Higher Vehicle Values: More expensive vehicles cost more to insure. The correlation is straightforward.

Powerful Acceleration: Many EVs accelerate extremely quickly, which statistically increases accident risk. Some models 60 mph in under 4 seconds, way faster than most sports cars. A car accident lawyer handling EV cases notes that the instant torque can catch inexperienced drivers off guard, leading to more frequent collision claims.

Expect to pay $1,800 to $3,000 annually for EV insurance compared to $1,400 to $2,200 for gas vehicles.

Maintenance Costs: The Real Savings

Electric vehicles shine in maintenance costs. They have fewer moving parts and don’t need oil changes, transmission repairs, or exhaust system work.

What EVs Don’t Need:

Oil changes ($50-$100 every 5,000 miles)

Transmission service ($150-$250 every 30,000 miles)

Spark plug replacement ($100-$300 every 30,000 miles)

Exhaust system repairs ($200-$2,000 as needed)

Engine air filter changes ($20-$50 annually)

What EVs Still Need:

Tire rotations ($50-$100 every 5,000 miles)

Tire replacements (EVs wear tires faster due to weight and torque)

Brake fluid changes ($100-$150 every 2-3 years)

Cabin air filter replacement ($30-$80 annually)

Windshield wiper replacements ($20-$50 annually)

12-volt battery replacement ($100-$300 every 3-5 years)

EVs use regenerative braking, which captures energy and slows the vehicle without using traditional brakes. This extends brake pad life significantly, sometimes lasting the entire life of the vehicle.

Consumer Reports data shows EV maintenance costs average $0.06 per mile compared to $0.10 per mile for gas vehicles. Over 100,000 miles, this saves $4,000.

Battery Degradation and Replacement

EV batteries lose capacity over time. Most manufacturers warranty batteries for 8 years or 100,000 miles, guaranteeing at least 70% capacity retention.

Real-world data shows modern EVs lose about 2-3% capacity per year. After 8 years, expect 75-85% of original range. A car rated for 300 miles when new might deliver 225-255 miles after a decade.

Battery replacement costs vary wildly:

Nissan Leaf: $5,500-$8,500

Chevrolet Bolt: $16,000-$18,000

Tesla Model 3: $13,000-$16,000

Ford Mustang Mach-E: $20,000-$23,000

Most owners never replace batteries. Vehicles typically get sold or traded before batteries need replacement. The next owner inherits this potential cost.

Charging Time: The Hidden Cost

Time is money. Charging takes longer than pumping gas, and this difference has real costs.

Home Charging: 6-12 hours for a full charge on Level 2. This happens overnight, so time impact is minimal.

Public Level 2 Charging: 4-8 hours for a full charge. Useful while shopping or at work.

DC Fast Charging: 20-40 minutes to reach 80% charge. The last 20% takes another 20-30 minutes due to charging speed limitations.

Road trips require planning around charging stops. A 500-mile drive that takes 8 hours in a gas car might take 9-10 hours in an EV with charging stops. Some people consider this acceptable. Others find it frustrating.

Cold weather slows charging significantly. Winter temperatures can increase charging time by 30-50%.

Depreciation Hits Differently

Electric vehicles depreciate faster than gas cars in their first few years. Rapid improvements in battery technology and range make older models less desirable.

iSeeCars data shows EVs lose 49.1% of their value after three years compared to 39.1% for gas vehicles. A $50,000 EV drops to $25,450 in value while a $50,000 gas car drops to $30,450, a $5,000 difference.

However, depreciation patterns are shifting. As EV technology matures and gas prices remain high, used EV values are stabilizing. Tesla vehicles hold value better than most other EVs.

The 5-Year Total Cost Comparison

Let’s calculate the real cost of owning an EV for five years versus a comparable gas vehicle, using a mid-range sedan as our example.

Electric Vehicle (5 years, 60,000 miles):

Purchase price: $45,000

Federal tax credit: -$7,500

Home charging installation: $3,000

Electricity costs: $2,100

Insurance: $12,000

Maintenance: $3,600

Total: $58,200

Resale value at 5 years: -$22,500

Net cost: $35,700

Gas Vehicle (5 years, 60,000 miles):

Purchase price: $35,000

Gasoline costs: $7,200

Insurance: $9,000

Maintenance: $6,000

Total: $57,200

Resale value at 5 years: -$21,000

Net cost: $36,200

The difference? Just $500 over five years. The EV costs slightly less, but not by much.

When EVs Make Financial Sense

Electric vehicles save you money in specific situations:

You Drive a Lot: High mileage increases fuel savings. Driving 20,000 miles annually doubles your savings compared to 10,000 miles.

You Have Cheap Electricity: Low electricity rates maximize savings. Time-of-use rates help even more.

You Keep Cars Long-Term: Maintenance savings accumulate over time. Keeping an EV for 10+ years provides maximum value.

You Can Charge at Home: Avoiding public charging stations saves significant money. Home charging costs one-third the price.

Gas Prices Are High: When gas exceeds $4.50 per gallon, EVs save more money. Current gas prices directly affect the calculation.

You Get Tax Credits: Qualifying for the full federal tax credit changes the math dramatically. Without it, payback periods extend significantly.

When Gas Cars Still Win

Stick with gas vehicles if:

You Rent or Live in an Apartment: Installing home charging is impossible. Relying on public charging gets expensive and inconvenient.

You Take Frequent Road Trips: Long-distance travel suits gas vehicles better. Charging infrastructure still has gaps in rural areas.

You Need Maximum Towing Capacity: EVs lose significant range when towing. Gas trucks handle heavy loads more efficiently.

You Live in Extreme Cold: Battery performance drops in freezing temperatures. Range can decrease 30-40% in winter.

You Can’t Afford Higher Upfront Costs: Not everyone can manage higher purchase prices while waiting for long-term savings.

The Bottom Line About Shifting to EV

Electric vehicles cost more to buy but less to run. Whether they save you money depends entirely on your driving habits, local electricity rates, available tax credits, and how long you keep the vehicle.

Don’t buy an EV purely for financial reasons unless the numbers work specifically for your situation. Calculate your personal costs using actual electricity rates in your area and realistic estimates of your annual mileage.

Remember that non-financial factors matter too. Environmental impact, driving experience, and supporting new technology influence many buyers’ decisions. These benefits have value even if they don’t show up on a spreadsheet.

Do your homework, run the numbers honestly, and make the choice that fits your life and budget. Electric vehicles work great for many people, just make sure you’re one of them before making the investment.",https://speedwaymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2163.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:02:21.527433

Reasons For Hope

Several U.S. states have begun offering targeted incentives for clean energy manufacturing to help counter federal fecklessness and deindustrialization!

Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania is investing to support the in-state manufacturing expansion of Eos Energy, a startup making a cutting-edge new zinc-based battery model.

“We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology.”

— Governor Josh Shapiro (D-PA)

Georgia is actively supporting Korean company Hyundai’s still-accelerating EV and battery factory work, keeping the state’s clean industry growing even in the wake of the recent shameful federal attack on a Georgia Hyundai factory site.

Tennessee is promoting workforce development to support the Blue Oval SK Ford/SK On joint venture making EV batteries for Ford’s new “center of the company” affordable EV platform.

Startup Electra just opened a new plant in Colorado with state government support, showcasing their brand-new method of producing clean steel by using “electrowinning” metal refining to produce high-quality iron, instead of coal-fired blast furnaces. They’re already attracting clients!

Even while China is dominating global manufacturing and the federal government is sabotaging the country by attacking America’s clean energy industries, many state leaders are stepping up and working hard to support innovation and technological progress. Clean manufacturing must remain a priority for state governments, both to support their local economies and to rebuild national competitiveness!

“The Artesia refinery has operated for more than a century, making this not a new problem but a long-ignored one,” the coalition’s letter states.","A coalition of environment and health organizations on Thursday requested the New Mexico Environment Department take immediate action toward air monitoring and developing community health guidance following an explosion at an oil refinery in Artesia.

HF Sinclair’s Navajo Refinery, located in southeast New Mexico and the Permian Basin, experienced an explosion and fires on Oct. 31, which injured three and caused thick smoke to waft over the city.

Members of the Permian Basin Climate Justice Coalition, which represents more than 20 organizations devoted to environment, health and community advocacy, sent a letter Thursday to New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney asking for the department to take action to protect southeastern New Mexicans.

They specifically called for the department to install a permanent air monitor in Artesia; provide real-time air-quality data to the public; develop health guidance for the public in cases of industrial emergencies; hold a public meeting in Artesia within a month to let the public know the plans for air safety and monitoring; and establish a mobile air monitoring unit in the Permian Basin.

NMED stated in January 2025 that the department had secured funding for such a mobile unit through a $500,000 settlement between WildEarth Guardians and OXY USA, Inc., an oil and gas producer in the region.

“Our coalition has documented countless spills, leaks, and releases across the Permian. When something like this [explosion] happens, people deserve truth and transparency,” Melissa Troutman, climate and health advocate for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Numerous studies now document the health impacts experienced by people living in the oilfields. Air monitoring shouldn’t be optional in communities surrounded by refineries and fracking sites.”

NMED Director of Communications Drew Goretzka told Source in a written statement Thursday that the department has not had a chance to thoroughly review the coalition’s letter yet.

“Sec. Kenney and the Department are open to all community monitoring actions that can better protect New Mexican’s air quality in the wake of the HF Sinclair Navajo Refinery explosion,” Goretzka wrote.

The coalition pointed out that the NMED operates two air monitors in the Permian Basin in Carlsbad and Hobbs, but these monitors do not track air pollution around Artesia.

“The Artesia refinery has operated for more than a century, making this not a new problem but a long-ignored one,” the coalition’s letter states. “An independent air monitor in this community is beyond long overdue. No parent should have to wonder whether it’s safe for their children to trick-or-treat outside, breathe the evening air, or go to school the next morning.”

Mariel Nanasi, executive director of New Energy Economy, said in a statement that air pollutants are a known cause of asthma, mortality and other ailments, and residents in the Permian Basin “deserve” to be protected from such harms.

“Action cannot be taken until the state acts to collect data and provide families with real-time information so they can protect themselves, their children and the elderly when ozone precursors, [Volatile Organic Compounds] and particulates rise to dangerous levels,” Nanasi said. “The state cannot continue to depend on the EPA to take action to protect its own residents. They are depending on NMED to take action.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sinclair-1024x6811763730996.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=u1fsP73i,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:30.770881

Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.

The Treasury Department’s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a “ whole of government ” approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government — not just Homeland Security — to come up with ways to help carry out the president’s hardline immigration agenda.

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.

For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance, even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits.

Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump's broader policies.

“It’s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,” said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.

“Implementing this will require determining who has status and who doesn’t, which is another way that the Trump administration will expand its deportation dragnet.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gOje0xd0BasHorWey0O9Kg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp_finance_889/bff2caf8141c07ee5014d360534600ac,N,,2025-11-21 12:01:16.896476

The IEA’s Energy Efficiency 2025 report shows that progress is being made on energy efficiency but its speed is being hindered by a lack of skills

Global energy efficiency progress is set to improve by 1.8% in 2025, up from around 1% in 2024 according to the IEA’s Energy Efficiency 2025 report.

However, the rate of progress has fallen to 1.3% per year on average since 2019.

This is well below the COP28 target of a 4% annual improvement by 2030.

“The acceleration in global progress on energy efficiency that we’re seeing in 2025 is encouraging, including positive signs in some major emerging economies,” says Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA.

“But our analysis shows that governments need to work even harder to ensure efficiency’s full range of benefits are enjoyed by as many people as possible

“Energy efficiency has the power to enhance people’s lives and livelihoods through greater energy security, more affordable bills, improved economic competitiveness and lower emissions.”

2. Does Saudi Arabia's AI Push Signal Shift Away From Oil?

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seeks advanced semiconductor technology from Washington to establish the Kingdom as an AI hub under Vision 2030

Saudi Arabia’s bid to become a global AI powerhouse has become central to diplomatic discussions in Washington, with access to high-end semiconductor chips now at the heart of dealmaking between the kingdom and the US.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s recent White House visit marks a pivotal moment in Saudi ambitions, with strategic partnerships and technology investments reinforcing the country’s Vision 2030 agenda.​​

The US continues to use export controls on advanced semiconductors as a strategic lever in global technology diplomacy, shaping deals that determine which nations can develop next-generation AI systems.

High-performance chips from leading companies such as Nvidia and AMD have become critical for constructing data centres and powering the machine learning models that underpin AI.

Recent regulatory shifts favouring Gulf nations have enabled Saudi Arabia to pursue direct access and investment in semiconductor technology, driving a wave of deals targeting AI infrastructure and cloud capabilities across the kingdom.​

Google's US$40bn Texas investment links new AI data centres to massive energy projects and workforce training, powering the state's tech future

Google has begun a large-scale data centre expansion across Texas, confirming a US$40bn investment through 2027 that is intrinsically linked to the state's energy capacity.

The programme is centred on delivering new cloud and AI infrastructure with a parallel focus on bringing new energy resources to the grid and developing a skilled workforce to build and manage it.

The investment includes plans for new data centre campuses in Armstrong and Haskell Counties, alongside an expansion of its existing facilities in Ellis County.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, describes the move as “a significant expansion of our commitment to the Lone Star State”.

“AI is poised to accelerate a new golden age of American innovation and Texas – with its optimism and talent – is leading the way,"" he adds.

Some governments and nonprofits are suing fossil fuel companies for their role in causing climate change.

But is it possible to directly connect the actions of individual fossil fuel companies to the damages caused by global warming?

Chris Callahan of Indiana University says yes.

He and a Dartmouth College scientist recently used climate models to link emissions data from major fossil fuel companies to the increase in extreme heat events around the world. Then they connected those increases to economic losses from harms like lower crop yields and reduced worker productivity.

Callahan: “We showed that major fossil fuel firms like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, can be linked to billions or even trillions of dollars in economic losses around the world from rising extreme heat over the last 30 years.”

But Callahan says the most important takeaway from this research is not any specific number. It’s the implication for climate liability lawsuits.

Callahan: “It is no longer sufficient for a company to simply say, ‘We’re one of many emitters and it’s not clear what impacts we’ve caused, so you can’t hold us liable.’ In fact, we can show what impacts have been caused by an individual emitter, and we believe that message will be important in these cases.”

Located in the eastern part of the German North Sea, it will generate 435 megawatts (MW) of clean electricity as part of the wider Nordseecluster, a group of offshore wind farms expected to reach up to 1.6 gigawatts (GW).

Once the cluster is operational, it will generate enough renewable energy to power around 1.6 million households, equivalent to five percent of all German homes. The project is jointly realised by RWE and Norges Bank Investment Management, with RWE leading construction and operation.

The Innovation Fund supports N2OWF with a grant of €95.9 million, sourced from revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System. It was selected in the 2021 large-scale call and is on track to lead the way in low-carbon offshore technologies and accelerate Europe’s clean energy transition.

Driving innovation in offshore wind

Innovation sits at the heart of N2OWF’s design. The project is among the first to deploy 15-megawatt wind turbines equipped with switchgears which are free of sulphur hexafluoride (SF₆) - a potent greenhouse gas with a warming effect stronger than carbon dioxide. It utilises simpler foundation structures without a transition piece between the monopile foundation and the turbine tower. This reduces the amount of steel required, thus cutting emissions during both manufacturing and construction, also making installation more efficient.

To further lower its carbon footprint, the project opts for methanol-ready or hybrid battery-electric vessels for installations and maintenance. These cleaner ships reduce fuel consumption and help limit emissions throughout the wind farm’s lifetime.

When fully operational in early 2027, N2OWF is expected to deliver around 1,800 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean electricity each year.

From planning to construction

The project reached financial close in January 2025, following several key milestones. The final investment decision was made on schedule, and in June 2024, the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) issued the full construction and operation permit.

Despite global supply chain challenges, N2OWF successfully secured contracts for all its main components, including turbines, foundations, substations, and vessels, ensuring manufacturing to begin without delay.

The project has now moved into the construction phase. The installation of the innovative monopile foundations has been successfully completed using advanced noise mitigation technologies designed to protect marine ecosystems. Meanwhile, factory testing of turbine and substation components is progressing, keeping the project firmly aligned with its delivery timetable.

Boosting Regional and European Value

Beyond its positive environmental and climactic impact, N2OWF brings significant economic and social benefits. In East Friesland, a new Offshore Wind Control Centre is being built in Jemgum. Once implemented in spring 2026, it will oversee RWE’s offshore wind assets across Germany and continental Europe, creating around 50 skilled jobs and strengthening the region as a hub for renewable energy expertise.

N2OWF also showcases Europe-wide industrial cooperation. Key components are being manufactured and assembled across several EU Member States, including Poland, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. This broad collaboration supports regional economies, foster shared know-how, and reinforces Europe’s leadership in offshore wind technology.

A blueprint for tomorrow’s offshore wind

“N2OWF is an integral part of our 1.6-gigawatt Nordseecluster offshore wind project off the German coast — but it represents so much more. It is a portfolio of innovations that allow us to drive greenhouse gas reduction at an entirely new scale. We are proud that support from the Innovation Fund has enabled our team to develop a broad range of solutions, the first of which are now becoming a reality” said Sven Schulemann, RWE’s Project Director of the Nordseecluster.

By combining advanced technology with a clear commitment to reduce emissions, N2OWF contributes directly to the goals of the Clean Industrial Deal and the Europe’s climate neutrality target for 2050. It shows that innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand, delivering tangible benefits for Europe’s climate, economy, and citizens.

My team’s task was to complete the program’s first phase: creating a Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for Gates County.
Our maps captured the places Gates County residents care most about: their schools, their farmland, their roads, and the beloved Merchants Millpond State Park.
Gates County is tight-knit, welcoming, and full of people who care about their home.
If I had to sum up what I carried with me from Gates County, it’s this: data matters, but people matter more.","Cloudy skies, sound of light drizzle, swaying pine forests, and the quiet stillness of Merchants Millpond. These are just some of the images that come to mind when I think about my summer in Gates County. Tucked away in northeastern North Carolina, Gates is a small, rural county where community bonds run deep and the land itself shapes daily life. This summer, I had the privilege of learning just how closely resilience is tied to both place and people.

I worked with the Coastal Resilience Intensive Training Program (C-CRIT), a partnership between NC State University and Conservation Corps North Carolina. Modeled after the statewide Resilient Coastal Communities Program (RCCP), C-CRIT helps counties prepare for hazards like hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and sea level rise. My team’s task was to complete the program’s first phase: creating a Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for Gates County.

When I arrived, I didn’t know the first thing about GIS mapping. The idea that my maps could guide decisions about funding or infrastructure felt overwhelming. But with the guidance of my mentors, Dr. Ward and Dr. Sanchez, I quickly discovered that maps can do more than display data, they can tell stories. Our maps captured the places Gates County residents care most about: their schools, their farmland, their roads, and the beloved Merchants Millpond State Park. We then overlaid hazards like flooding or drought to show what was at risk.

For my individual project, I focused on something that struck close to my own interests: healthcare access. I mapped hospital driving times across the county to understand how quickly residents could reach medical care. The results were sobering. Long travel times could mean delayed care during emergencies, a reality that has very real consequences for health and safety. Presenting this work as a research poster at our symposium reminded me why I’m pursuing both environmental science and medicine, to explore the ways our surroundings directly affect people’s well-being.

What I didn’t expect was how much this experience would connect with my own goals. I’m majoring in Environmental Sciences, but I plan to go to medical school after graduation. I’ve always been interested in how the environment affects people’s health, and this internship helped me see that connection up close. It’s one thing to learn about environmental health in a lecture hall and it’s another to see how a flooded road or a lack of nearby hospitals could potentially be a problem for residents. I really valued having that real world exposure.

One of the best parts of this internship was how personal it felt. We weren’t just making maps behind a screen. We were out in the community, attending commissioner meetings and talking with local leaders. We also had opportunities to talk to people who work with the RCCP and also others who are passionate about community resilience. This also gave me a new perspective and listening to people who are so passionate about what they do is so inspiring and gives me hope for the future. At first, I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about working in a rural county. I worried I might feel out of place or disconnected. But over time, I found the exact opposite. Gates County is tight-knit, welcoming, and full of people who care about their home. Some of my favorite moments were just having conversations, whether it was with the sheriff, a county commissioner, or a resident who wanted to tell us what they loved about Gates county and what they hope to see for the future. Looking back, this internship taught me so much more than how to use ArcGIS. It taught me patience and how to ask questions when I don’t know something. It taught me how to communicate science in a way that makes sense to people outside of the field. It also showed me what kind of work really excites me: the kind that blends science, public health, and direct impact on communities.

Through these experiences, I learned lessons that go beyond GIS. I learned patience, the importance of asking questions when I don’t know the answer, and how to communicate science in a way that makes sense outside of academia. Most importantly, I learned that the kind of work that excites me blends science, public health, and community connection.

C-CRIT pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best possible way. I came in with no mapping experience and left with not only technical skills, but also a stronger sense of direction for my future. Although I still plan to go into medicine, this experience taught me that resilience is about more than infrastructure but also it’s about people, their health, and the connections that tie them to the places they call home.

If I had to sum up what I carried with me from Gates County, it’s this: data matters, but people matter more. Our maps and reports may help Gates County secure grants and prepare for hazards, but the real strength of this work lies in the community’s voice. That’s what resilience truly looks like.

Moving forward, I want to keep finding ways to connect environmental science and healthcare. It’s something I’ve been interested in for a long time, and I believe more research needs to be done on how our environment impacts health. I’ve started making progress toward that goal by working in the STRIVE Study at NC State University, a collaboration between UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, Emory, and NCSU. The project focuses on how environmental factors affect liver conditions and liver health, which ties directly into my interests. I’m excited to keep building on what I learned this summer and continue exploring how science and medicine can work together to improve people’s lives.",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/fer/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/11/Akshits.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:04:35.278704

Vienna, Austria, November 20, 2025

Chair,

The United States aligns with the joint statement delivered by Canada with what we believe is an historic number of cosponsors for a Ukraine statement at the Board and would like to make the following remarks in our national capacity. We thank the Director General for his latest report on the nuclear safety, security, and safeguards situation in Ukraine. We laud the Secretariat for its profound dedication to providing technical assistance at the nuclear facilities in Ukraine. The United States remains hopeful our diplomatic efforts to secure a durable peace between Ukraine and Russia will soon yield positive outcomes.

As the sides continue pursuing peace, we reiterate our longstanding call for all parties to refrain from taking any actions that could result in a nuclear incident in Ukraine, especially at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), which remains on the front lines of active combat. Any effort to restart a reactor at the ZNPP while the conflict is ongoing would be dangerous given the grave risks of causing a nuclear incident, particularly considering the condition of the plant, obstacles to regular and expert maintenance, and the status of water and reliable power supply for cooling.

The United States continues to support the IAEA’s unique technical role assisting Ukraine in maintaining nuclear safety and security while fulfilling the obligatory safeguards activities throughout this conflict. We are pleased to contribute to this important mission, including through a pledge of three million dollars for Ukraine assistance activities in our recently announced 95 million dollar voluntary contribution.

Chair,

During this reporting period, we were extremely alarmed by the damage caused to the last of the ZNPP’s two remaining transmission cables to off-site power supply, which forced the plant to rely exclusively on emergency diesel generators for a month.

This situation is unacceptable. We are grateful for DG Grossi’s swift diplomatic efforts to negotiate temporary and localized ceasefire zones between Ukraine and the Russian Federation that allowed for the ground repair work resulting in the October 23 reconnection of the ZNPP 750 kV primary power line and the November 8 reconnection of the ZNPP 330 kV back-up power line, helping to avoid a potential nuclear incident. We were seriously concerned to hear late last week that the 750 kV line was once again damaged, an incident that only underscores ZNPP’s fragile condition. We are grateful for the quick repair work that allowed for its reconnection.

We also remain highly concerned by the ongoing risks to reliable offsite power at Ukraine’s operating nuclear power plants. Recent strikes on electrical substations and other critical infrastructure have disrupted those plants’ operations. We implore parties to refrain from actions that further imperil nuclear safety.

The report also confirms the Agency’s vital verification activities in Ukraine continue to be undertaken pursuant to Ukraine’s Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol despite the challenging circumstances. While we note the Agency was able to successfully conduct physical inventory verifications at several facilities in Ukraine, we remain concerned about full and unfettered implementation of such activities at the ZNPP and call on Russia not to impede the Agency’s ability to undertake these mandatory technical activities at the site. We welcome Ukraine’s continued efforts to fulfill its safeguards obligations despite the conflict, and we note the Agency has found no indication that would give rise to a proliferation concern in Ukraine.

Chair,

With these remarks, the United States takes note of the Director General’s latest report, GOV/2025/66, on Nuclear Safety, Security, and Safeguards in Ukraine and requests the report be made public.

Thank you, Chair.",https://vienna.usmission.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2025/11/54936344570_846e221dd5_o.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:03:25.185290

David Booth is Driving’s senior writer as well as the producer of Driving.ca’s Driving into the Future panels and Motor Mouth podcasts. Having written about everything from the exact benefits of Diamond Like Coating (DLC) on motorcycle camshafts to why Range Rovers are the best vehicles for those suffering from opioid-induced constipation, Booth leaves no stone unturned in his quest for automotive veritas. Besides his long tenure with Driving, he was the editor in chief of Autovision magazine for 25 years and his stories have been published in motorcycle magazines around the world including the United States, England, Germany and Australia.

Education

Graduating from Queen Elizabeth High School in 1973, Booth moved from his Northern Quebec hometown of Sept-Iles — also home to Montreal Canadiens great, Guy Carbonneau — to Ottawa to study Mechanical Engineering at Carleton University. There, he wrote a thesis on the then-burgeoning technology of anti-lock brakes for motorcycles and spent time researching the also then-burgeoning use of water tunnels for aerodynamic testing.

Experience

After three years writing for Cycle Canada magazine and another three working for the then oldest magazine in Canada, Canadian Automotive Trade, Booth, along with current Driving writer Brian Harper and then Toronto Star contributor Alex Law, created an automotive editorial services group that supplied road tests, news, and service bulletins to what was then called Southam newspapers.

When Southam became Postmedia with its purchase by Conrad Black and the subsequent introduction of the National Post, Booth was asked to start up the then Driver’s Edge section, which became Driving.ca when Postmedia moved into the digital age. In the past 41 years, Booth has tested well over 500 motorcycles, 1,500 passenger cars, and nearly every significant supercar of the last 30 years.

A new system called K-flex allows the plant to build SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans on a single assembly line.

This flexible manufacturing line reduces the time and cost typically required to retool for new vehicle models.

GEORGETOWN, KY — Autonomous sleds ferry vehicle shells, sparks dart in every direction and robotic arms as tall as basketball hoops install car windows.

Like an industrial symphony from another world, each process plays its part in the intricate choreography of Toyota’s largest manufacturing plant on Earth.

Located on a 1,300-acre plot of land 70 miles away from Louisville, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) represents the future of automotive production.

Toyota has 14 manufacturing plants all over the U.S. including in Indiana, Mississippi and Jackson, Tenn., where engine blocks and transmission cases and housings are produced. So far, TMMK is the only Toyota plant in the world to implement this new technology.

But as TMMK works to adapt its manufacturing capabilities, on Nov. 18 Toyota Motor announced it will invest more than $912 million to renovate its manufacturing sites across five states, including at TMMK and its Tennessee plant. A week before that announcement, Toyota said it's planning a $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina.

Meanwhile, at the plant responsible for more than 435,600 vehicles and 714,400 engines in 2024, the company is spending $1.8 billion to introduce a more flexible, technologically advanced manufacturing line poised to redefine efficiency and scale.

Historically, manufacturing assembly lines have strict size requirements limiting production, but at TMMK that's not the case. SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans can all be built on one line, by something called K-flex.

What is Toyota's new K-flex platform?

“A lot of people think that means Kentucky flexibility, but what it really means is actually K platform flexibility,” TMMK President Kerry Creech said.

A K platform, specific to Toyota, is a shared skeleton that includes the chassis, suspension and drivetrain for Toyota-produced vehicles like the Camry, RAV, Highlander, Sienna, Lexus RX and NX.

K-flex allows for the versatility of that shared skeleton across SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans all on one line.

While only one of its three manufacturing lines has full flexibility, Creech — who began his TMMK tenure in 1990 as a powertrain production team member — said as manufacturing demands evolve, flexibility is vital across the assembly line.

Roughly 35 years ago, “we could only build a sedan” on the line due to size restrictions, he said. At that time, the industry was producing about 80% sedans and 20% light trucks and SUVs. But “now that’s flipped,” Creech added.

To meet evolving consumer demand, Toyota is rolling out new vehicle models. But the conventional retooling process for electric and hybrid vehicles can be expensive and time-consuming, slowing production and straining output.

So the automaker had to rethink how it builds cars to stay competitive in a market shifting toward electrification and diverse vehicle types, Creech said.

“Whether it’s a plug-in hybrid or a total battery electric vehicle, we had to have that flexibility,"" Creech said.

Traditionally, as automakers gear up for the latest model, they invest heavily into modifying the manufacturing line to meet the dimensions of the next vehicle. With K-flex, that’s not the case.

“So we really reduce our production preparation lead time, as well as our capital expense, which kind of gives us an advantage at this facility compared to the traditional, because each time you introduce a new vehicle, then you may be changing some of the structure that’s in there,” Vice President of Manufacturing Chad Miller said, on the intricacies needed for different vehicles.

While K-flex allows for adjustability among many of its vehicles, it doesn't encompass everything. Some larger vehicles like SUVs and framed trucks are too big to be built on the flexible line.

In addition to K platform products, TMMK also produces 4-cylinder and V6 engines, hydrogen fuel cell kits, axles, steering components, machines blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts, rods and axle assemblies and dies.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/07/PNAS/86571792007-tmmk-025.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-21 12:02:07.956789

Pittsboro, NC – On November 17, 2025, Chatham County Board of Commissioners Chair Karen Howard presented the 2025 State of Chatham County Report at the Board’s Regular Session in Pittsboro.

The State of Chatham County is the county’s annual report covering July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025, and for the first time provided in both English and Spanish.

The report highlights how the County is progressing in alignment with the Board of Commissioners’ four goal focus areas – Environment & Land Use, Governance & Public Safety, Resilience & Well-Being, and Economy & Infrastructure. By organizing the report around these goals, the County provides a clear, accountable, and transparent update on initiatives, services, and accomplishments across departments. This structure ensures that all efforts are directly tied to the broader vision for Chatham’s future.

“As Chatham County continues its historic growth, we are taking decisive steps to guide development in a way that safeguards the heritage and natural beauty that define our community,” said Karen Howard, Chair of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners. “Through thoughtful planning and strategic investment, we are laying the foundation for a vibrant economy and a brighter future for all who call Chatham home. My fellow commissioners and I are incredibly proud of the outstanding work of our staff, and we remain fully committed to ensuring that future growth reflects the community-driven vision set forth in Plan Chatham.”

The report includes key highlights:

Environment & Land Use

Chatham County is working to promote sustainability, equity, and conservation countywide.

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption continues to rise across Chatham County, reflected in a 15% increase in energy distributed through the County’s four public charging stations, which collectively delivered over 23 megawatt-hours of electricity this year. This clean energy use prevented the release of an estimated 19 tons of CO₂.

The County’s two solar energy systems generated 230 megawatt-hours—enough to power the equivalent of 13 homes for a year.

The Agricultural Preservation & Development Trust Fund awarded $325,000 for four conservation easements, securing 174 acres, with 330 additional acres pending protection.

Governance & Public Safety

Chatham County is building a safer, stronger, and more connected community for all.

But they’ve also got their fingers on the pulse of the car economy.
But this rise suggests more households are being squeezed, with some having to choose between car payments and things like covering rent or buying groceries.
“And when we start seeing them pull back, that can be a sign or a warning sign of things to come for the general economy,” Davies said.
When gauging the overall health of our economy, Davies looks for different indicators.","This is a part of an occasional series looking at aspects of Colorado’s faltering economy.

The market for new cars in the U.S. hit a significant milestone in September. For the first time, the average price topped $50,000.

That’s causing some major sticker shock for buyers. And it’s not the only indicator of whether the industry might be sputtering, which has implications for the overall economy.

Here’s a look at three factors at play in the state and beyond.

The EV Craze consumed Colorado

Bridget Myers of Boulder remembers when $50,000 could buy a home decades ago. And when she needed a new car, the price tags she saw led her to leasing an electric vehicle. Her first.

That’s because the deal she got on a new Nissan Leaf was too good to pass up.

“They had a rebate system, so it was very economical,” she said. “Instead of paying several hundred a month, I have a leased vehicle that costs $54.”

And she’s not alone. Many Coloradans rushed to buy or lease EVs, lured in by those attractive incentives.

In the third quarter of this year, battery-powered EVs made up 26.4% of the cars registered in Colorado. That big spike was largely due to federal tax credits going away right before October. Over that same period, more than 438,000 EVs were sold or leased in the U.S. That’s a tenth of the total market share nationwide.

“Good or bad, EVs were brought to us,” Jeff Silverberg, general manager of John Elway Chevrolet in Englewood, said. “It wasn't really the consumer pulling for them, it was more so the manufacturer, the governments certainly pushing them. Now, as a car dealer, I think most everyone in my position would agree, I will sell anything.”

And that includes selling EVs with savings that were “generationally good,” Silverberg said.

“There's no calculator on Earth that says a $70,000 vehicle should lease for $249. Certainly not a good one. And that's what we saw.”

Screaming deals on EVs also helped fill the growing void of compact and budget cars. While cheaper sedans like the Ford Focus have gone away, others like the Toyota Corolla keep getting more expensive.

As for Myers, leasing her Nissan Leaf was also about finding something environmentally friendly. But with the federal rebates now gone and state rebates taking a hit too, that could turn the EV market on its head. And when her lease is up, Myers isn’t sure what she’ll do.

“What we would look at is: Is it cost-effective? Would we buy this car outright? Would we continue just to lease it? Does our lease rate go up?”

Manufacturers and dealers are hedging their bets

Tommy Mica and his dad, Roman, run The Fast Lane (TFL) Car. Roman’s a former TV reporter, and now they’re content creators who cover the auto industry, and they say automakers seem unsure about the economic future.

“On the face of it, things seem good. The sales numbers are still strong,” Tommy said. “But I get that there's this underlying tone across the majority of manufacturers [that] things are not OK.”

TFL Car gets millions of views a month across its social media channels. The Micas have 22 acres of testing grounds near Berthoud, and they’re all about automotive performance. But they’ve also got their fingers on the pulse of the car economy.

And right now, tariffs are a big wildcard.

“Because these are companies that move incredibly slowly,” Tommy said. “They take years and years to make decisions, and they can't make decisions if the laws are changing every couple of weeks.”

And Tommy stressed that there’s no such thing as an American-made car anymore.

“Your cars are made from parts from around the world, and these companies are losing it trying to figure out how to keep the wheels on the bus, both literally and figuratively,” he said.

For Silverberg of John Elway Chevrolet, he said manufacturers and dealers like his are trying to hedge.

“Certainty is good for business, and positive certainty is even better than negative certainty. We don't see a lot of certainty.”

On top of fewer EV incentives and tariffs increasing costs, buyers are also seeing high interest rates and all sorts of fees that can be tacked on when buying a vehicle.

“So I think people are doing what is normal in human nature, which is keep your hands close to the vest when you're not so sure about what's going on,” Silverberg said.

What about the financials and the risks?

To be clear, people are still buying vehicles. But there are other trends to note.

For one, nearly 20% of monthly payments for new cars are above $1,000, according to Edmunds. That’s tied to more sales of big SUVs, trucks and luxury vehicles. For used vehicles, those payments now make up over 6%, which is an all-time high.

On top of bigger monthly payments, the average down payment is at its lowest in 4 years. Plus, many buyers are taking out longer-term loans. And keeping up with payments over the long term could get really tough for some buyers.

Shaun Davies, an associate professor of finance at the University of Colorado Boulder, points to subprime auto loans. Those are for people with poorer credit, and they tend to come with higher interest rates and fees.

“Delinquency rates of 60 days plus on [those] payments is ticking upward,” Davies said.

More than 6.5% of borrowers have defaulted on those loans recently, “which is definitely concerning,” Davies added.

“That's oftentimes the canary in the coal mine because these are the folks with the most limited access to credit.”

It is just one measure, and Davies stressed that subprime auto loans typically account for 15 to 20% of all auto loans. But this rise suggests more households are being squeezed, with some having to choose between car payments and things like covering rent or buying groceries.

“And when we start seeing them pull back, that can be a sign or a warning sign of things to come for the general economy,” Davies said.

When gauging the overall health of our economy, Davies looks for different indicators. And he does point to one strong sign: Banks have a lot more capital on hand than they did right before the Great Recession.

“We're not horrible yet,” he said.

Tommy Mica of TFL Car says the 1989 Cadillac Allante he bought used for around $2,000 is popular among his viewers, who love to watch videos about it.

“There is a tremendous amount of interest in cars that people can buy for under $5,000,” he said. “So this is something that we've found a niche in; folks really want to see how far their dollar can go.”

But the used market has gotten really expensive and competitive too, especially for cars made in the last five years. While reporting this story, other Coloradans said it made no sense to even consider buying used because the value just isn’t there.

And when it comes to buying a new car and getting the best deal, Mica urged shoppers not to be super picky.

“It is genuinely impossible to buy a bad new car,” he said. “Unless you get one of the very rare cases of a lemon, they are going to be reliable and safe and have good technology and be quiet and do your thing.”

Colorado’s economy is flashing warning signs. Job growth has slowed to a trickle. Layoffs are inching up. The housing market is in a slump. Both the state and its biggest population center are struggling to plug massive budget holes. On top of all that, the longest government shutdown in history was weighing on the economy.

The big question, though, is whether all the bleak data points to something more serious: recession. And the answer is complicated.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/20251119-silent-recession-cars-nff-hwv-005.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 07:59:19.520280

Just 2.6% of U.S. Foundations Fund It,Michael Kavate,,,,,https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/76-of-americans-want-climate-action-just-2-3-of-u-s-foundations-fund-it,"Most philanthropists, like most people, say they want climate action.
Only about 2.6% of U.S. grantmakers made climate grants in 2023, based on my own searches of Candid’s grants database.
Yet the share of funders making climate grants rose by less than a percentage point.
The research paper reported that 69% of respondents were willing to contribute 1% or more of their income for climate action.
But if philanthropy is ever to truly mobilize on climate change, I think funders will have to metabolize a different figure altogether.","Most philanthropists, like most people, say they want climate action.

In 2022, when the Center for Effective Philanthropy asked foundation and nonprofit leaders how pressing they see the problem of climate change, 89% said it was “very urgent” or “extremely urgent.”

It just so happens that exactly the same share, 89%, of people from around the world want their governments to take greater action on the climate crisis, according to an international survey of 130,000 people across 125 countries published last year in the journal Nature Climate Change.

And it is repeated in the name of a media campaign, The 89 Percent Project, that kicked off this year to raise awareness that an overwhelming majority of people are concerned about climate change and want stronger action, even though most believe they are in a minority.

That paradox parallels philanthropy’s puzzling relationship with the climate crisis.

It is well known that the actual grant dollars do not match grantmakers’ expressed urgency about our fast-heating planet. Less than 2% of global philanthropic spending goes toward climate mitigation, despite recent gains, according to ClimateWorks Foundation.

It is less often noted that most grantmakers are not involved at all.

Only about 2.6% of U.S. grantmakers made climate grants in 2023, based on my own searches of Candid’s grants database. Even if that’s a bit off, due to the challenges Candid faces in collecting data, that is a long, long way from the portion of Americans, 76%, who back more robust government action on climate, according to the Nature study, let alone the worldwide rate, which this study and other sources have consistently found is between 80% and 89%.

Nor has the number of climate funders changed much in recent years. Despite concerted efforts to recruit new philanthropies, and climate-fueled fires and floods afflicting ever more corners of the nation and globe, the 2.6% rate is just a few points above where it was in 2015: 1.75%.

During that decade, in the U.S. alone, massive wildfires laid waste to swathes of Texas, Hawaii, Alaska, Oklahoma and, again and again, California. A whole cast of hurricanes — Harvey, Ian, Maria, Ida, Helene, Irene — have taken lives, destroyed homes and caused billions of dollars in damage across Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, Louisiana, North Carolina, the U.S. Virgin Islands and South Carolina. Yet the share of funders making climate grants rose by less than a percentage point.

Admittedly, using Candid’s data to gauge the total number of grantmakers giving out climate funding only produces a ballpark figure. Its database, after all, relies on the typically very limited grant descriptions listed by foundations in IRS filings, or the sometimes only modestly more detailed ones made public by foundations. Many of those may not explicitly mention climate, even if it is a motivation or contributing factor.

But even if you widen the count to every grantmaker that made any kind of environmental award — on the assumption that all such funding is at least tenuously connected to climate change — then you could say that 23.6% of grantmakers issued such grants in 2023, based on my analysis.

That seems impressive. You could not say, however, that the past decade of conflagrations and calamities has increased that figure in any meaningful way. In 2015, virtually the exact same share made such awards: 23.3%.

Perhaps philanthropy should actually pay attention to a different finding from the global survey. The research paper reported that 69% of respondents were willing to contribute 1% or more of their income for climate action.

At the risk of suggesting a very low bar, imagine if every philanthropy that believes climate change is a problem gave at least 1% of their grants budget for climate causes and invested at least 1% of their endowment in climate solutions?

Not that we should assume everyone gives only 1%. Academic research suggests that simply reading this article may make grantmakers more likely to give to climate.

A 2021 experiment, by the same group of researchers who produced the global survey, gave American subjects $450 each to divide between themselves and a nonprofit fighting climate change. Most gave half the sum to the charity. The experiment found that “being informed about the true share of Americans who think that people in the U.S. should try to fight global warming increases donations” by 6.3%.

So watch out funders: This article — in fact, just its headline! — may loosen your purse strings. Admittedly, someone magically gifting you $450 to use as you see fit is not exactly a clean fit for the daily reality facing most of us. But how far is it, philosophically speaking, from the strange position occupied by most grantmakers, whose job basically consists of giving away large sums of money?

All of these numbers are compelling, at least to me. But if philanthropy is ever to truly mobilize on climate change, I think funders will have to metabolize a different figure altogether. Climate-fueled drought, disease and death has yet to reach every funder’s doorstep, but the share who will be affected down the road is the most important percentage of all: 100%.

From freight haulers and farm equipment to fire trucks and snowplows, diesel engines are the literal torque behind our economy. Yet the same engines that built the nation’s backbone are now in Washington’s crosshairs — strangled by layers of federal regulation that threaten the people who keep America moving.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) insists it’s cleaning the air. But for those who live and work beyond the Beltway, these mandates aren’t saving the planet — they’re shutting down livelihoods.

The hidden cost of “Clean Air”

Since 2010, every diesel engine sold in the U.S. has come fitted with diesel particulate filters (DPFs) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems — components meant to capture soot and neutralize nitrogen oxides. In theory, they’re good for the environment. In practice, they’re crippling the very trucks that keep shelves stocked and first responders rolling.

DPFs clog, SCR units freeze, and when that happens, engines “derate” into limp mode — losing power until the system is fixed. A single failure can leave a truck stranded for days and cost upward of $5,000 to repair. For independent owner-operators, who haul 70 percent of the nation’s freight, that can mean the difference between survival and bankruptcy.

Even worse, under the Clean Air Act, simply repairing or modifying those failing systems can make a mechanic a federal felon.

When a mechanic becomes a criminal

Meet Troy Lake, a 65-year-old diesel expert from Cheyenne, Wyoming. For decades, Lake kept his community’s fleets running — farm trucks, snowplows, ambulances, and school buses. But when emissions systems began failing in subzero temperatures, Lake found himself forced to choose between obeying Washington’s regulations or keeping critical vehicles on the road.

His fix? Remove the faulty components and reprogram the engine to restore performance — a common-sense solution that kept essential services moving. But the EPA saw it differently. Under federal law, “tampering” with emissions controls carries up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines per vehicle.

In June 2024, Lake pleaded guilty to one count of emissions tampering. By December, a federal judge sentenced him to a year in prison. His shop was fined $52,500 and shut down. Ironically, during his sentence, Lake worked on the prison’s own diesel equipment — the same skills that, outside those walls, had made him a criminal.

Now home but barred from his trade, Lake carries a felony record that cost him his business, his rights, and his reputation — all for keeping his community’s engines running.

When good policy goes bad

No one disputes that diesel exhaust can harm air quality. The EPA’s emission rules dramatically cut pollution over the past decade — reducing soot by 90% and nitrogen oxides by 97%. But these results have come at an unsustainable cost to the people who depend on diesel most.

A 2023 Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association survey revealed that 40% of truckers had experienced emissions-related breakdowns. Each incident cost an average of $1,500 and countless hours of downtime. Multiply that across millions of trucks, and the burden on small businesses and rural economies is staggering.

Farmers, truckers, and local governments can’t afford the endless repair cycles. For them, Washington’s mandates translate into fewer working trucks, higher consumer costs, and dangerous response delays in emergencies.

Senator Lummis fights back

Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis sees what’s happening. She’s watched the federal government criminalize working Americans while ignoring the real-world consequences of its rules. In October 2025, she introduced the Diesel Truck Liberation Act (S. 3007) — legislation designed to restore sanity and balance.

The bill would:

Remove mandatory federal requirements for DPFs, SCRs, and onboard diagnostics.

Limit the EPA’s enforcement powers over diesel tuning and emissions deletes.

Protect mechanics and operators from prosecution for performing practical repairs.

Provide retroactive relief — vacating sentences, clearing records, and refunding fines for past convictions.

“This isn’t about pollution,” Lummis said. “It’s about common sense. Washington’s one-size-fits-all mandates don’t work for the people who keep America running.”

The EPA’s dilemma

Environmental advocates warn that such legislation could reverse decades of progress under the Clean Air Act. According to EPA estimates, fully removing emissions controls from trucks could increase soot and nitrogen oxides by as much as 50%, leading to higher pollution in areas near highways and industrial centers.

That’s a legitimate concern. Clean air matters. But it’s also true that today’s engine tuning and filtration technologies are far more advanced than those available when these mandates were written. Modern software-based solutions can meet or even exceed current tailpipe standards without fragile hardware that fails in real-world conditions.

Even current EPA leadership has acknowledged the need for flexibility and modernization. The question isn’t whether we should protect the environment — it’s whether rigid, outdated enforcement is the best way to do it.

The real-world impact

The stakes are enormous. More than half a million diesel trucks in America have already had their emissions systems removed — often out of necessity, not defiance. The trucking industry spends roughly $20 billion annually on emissions-related maintenance. For small operators, that’s unsustainable.

And the impact doesn’t stop at the loading dock. Fire departments, ambulance services, and municipal snowplows all run on diesel. If their vehicles can’t move, lives are at risk. A snowstorm doesn’t care about EPA compliance, and neither does a heart attack.

Environmentalists vs. everyday Americans

Opponents of the Diesel Truck Liberation Act argue that removing emissions hardware would increase pollution, disproportionately harming urban and low-income communities. Supporters counter that Washington’s policies have already created economic inequality by crushing rural economies and small operators.

The divide isn’t really about clean air — it’s about who gets to make the rules. Should unelected bureaucrats in D.C. dictate how a farmer in Wyoming runs his truck? Or should local communities have the flexibility to balance environmental goals with economic reality?

A turning point for common sense

The Diesel Truck Liberation Act doesn’t aim to destroy the Clean Air Act. It aims to reform it. It recognizes that environmental protection must work hand-in-hand with reliability, safety, and economic survival.

For people like Troy Lake, it’s about justice — not just for one man, but for thousands of mechanics and operators who’ve been punished for solving real problems in real America.

And there’s already a hopeful sign: President Trump recently issued a full pardon for Lake, acknowledging that enforcing broken regulations against hardworking Americans is not justice — it’s overreach.

The next step is whether Congress will follow through. The bill currently sits in the Senate Environment Committee, with hearings expected later this year. If it passes, it could set a precedent for rethinking how environmental policy is enforced — and how to protect the people who keep America running.

The road ahead

America’s diesel fleet isn’t the enemy. It’s the engine that powers our nation — from coast to coast, farm to factory, and every highway in between. Reasonable environmental goals are achievable, but not through criminalizing those who fix the equipment that keeps this country alive.

The question facing lawmakers is simple: Will they choose common sense — or continue punishing the very people who make modern life possible?

Currently, Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Honda Cars offer strong hybrid vehicles in the country.","One of India’s top industry lobbies has asked the government to initiate discussions on providing range-extended electric vehicles or REEVs, a type of hybrid vehicle, tax parity with EVs to incentivise automakers to introduce such models.

REEVs are electric vehicles supported by a small internal combustion engine to charge the battery when it is running low. Currently, no Indian manufacturer sells such vehicles in India. They are not classified differently under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. Hybrids attract a tax rate of 18% and 40%, depending on their size.

The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) has written to the ministry of heavy industries (MHI) that the current tax structure would force automakers to introduce such vehicles at a higher price, as they are generally heavier and bigger in size. Assocham counts Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Toyota Kirloskar Motors India Ltd, JSW Group and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd as its members.

Incentives for hybrid vehicles have already divided Indian automakers. Japanese companies, which have mastered this technology, have been lobbying the government to offer concessions to buyers of hybrid vehicles through lower taxation, direct subsidies to consumers, or the waiver of various state and central fees like registration charges. However, Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra have opposed any incentives to hybrid vehicles, arguing that it will hurt the adoption of pure EVs.

States including Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan have removed incentives for hybrid vehicles. Currently, only Chandigarh and Haryana offer incentives for hybrids.

MHI did not respond immediately to an emailed query.

In response to Mint’s queries, an Assocham spokesperson cited that the small internal combustion engine in a REEV helps “eliminate range anxiety inherent” in battery electric vehicles.

“The ICE comes into play only to charge the battery, which helps during long intercity drives and reduces dependence on charging infrastructure. This offers a practical, immediate solution of increasing an EV range while the public charging infrastructure for pure BEVs is still developing across the nation,” Assocham said. It is for this reason that Assocham has requested that REEVs be classified under the 5% GST bracket as applicable to BEVs, it said.

In the 18 November letter addressed to MHI secretary, Assocham said incentivising REEV can help boost the penetration of clean fuel cars in India. The letter was signed by Assocham secretary general. Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.

“We are grateful to the Government of India for their support on BEVs in form of GST benefit under the 5% slab and would request proportionate GST consideration for REEVs also,” the letter said, a copy of which was also sent to the Prime Minister’s Office, finance ministry, Niti Aayog and the Union roads ministry.

“Considering their ‘electric-only’ propulsion and alignment with the government’s EV objectives, we respectfully recommend that REEVs be classified under the 5% GST rate, similar to BEVs, on the basis of its propulsion system and emissions profile,” the body told the government.

The industry lobby, founded in 1920, stated that such vehicles can quickly alleviate customer range anxiety by carrying an onboard charger.

“REEVs have the vehicles propelling entirely on battery. The ICE comes into play only to charge the battery during long drives. This offers a practical, immediate solution of increasing an EV range,” the letter said.

The 2025 Global Automotive Consumer Study showed that customers in the country are less interested in buying electric vehicles (EVs) than in 2024. While only 8% of customers surveyed said they would prefer EVs as their next purchase, more than a third of the respondents chose hybrids.

The lobbying for a favourable tax regime for REEVs comes when the country has seen EV penetration fall after the tax rates on internal combustion engine vehicles fell. Electric four-wheeler penetration fell from 5.12% in September to 3.24% in October, the lowest levels since February 2025, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association.

Estimates by Hyundai Motor India suggest that the share of hybrid vehicles in India’s total market will increase from 2% in the financial year 2025 to 14% by FY30 and on par with EVs.

Currently, Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Honda Cars offer strong hybrid vehicles in the country.

“The government’s broader target for the remaining 70% of vehicles—after the initial 30% electric penetration—is expected to lean heavily toward hybrid or alternate technologies,” Assocham wrote in its letter. “REEVs are uniquely positioned to significantly mitigate climate impact within that 70% segment.”",https://i0.wp.com/a2ztaxcorp.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Industry-lobby-pushes-government-to-slash-GST-on-range-extended-EVs.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 07:59:24.193460

Strong market fundamentals and rising power demand continue to underpin long-term growth despite the tougher policy environment

Renewable energy investment in the US sits at a crossroads. On one hand, the market fundamentals remain strong: electricity demand is accelerating, conventional power plants are being retired, technology costs continue to fall, and the industrial base for clean energy and electrification is expanding rapidly.

On the other, the policy and regulatory environment has become increasingly difficult for businesses to operate in. Tax credits for solar and wind projects introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 have been rolled back, and multiple offshore wind project approvals have been withdrawn.

While global investors once viewed the US as a straightforward bet for large-scale renewables projects, it is now a market that demands nuance — an understanding of regional opportunities, regulatory volatility, and a shift to a longer-term perspective. Despite this complexity, the long-term case for renewables investment in the US market remains compelling.

Despite the noise, a few trends stand out as sustained drivers of renewable development across the US.

Renewables reach commercial maturity

Renewable energy is the most viable it has ever been. The combination of mature technology — onshore wind, solar photovoltaic and, to a lesser extent, battery energy storage systems — and increased global production means that clean energy can compete with other forms of energy generation on economic terms.

Solar costs have fallen by more than 80 per cent over the past decade — and this price is expected to drop further by 2030 — outcompeting natural gas and coal in most regions, even without subsidies. For investors, this cost advantage creates a resilient floor for returns, insulating projects from short-term price volatility and policy uncertainty.

Battery storage has also become an essential complement in the clean energy mix, allowing renewables such as solar to serve as reliable baseload power, rather than an intermittent supply. Combining these technologies means energy can be stored and released to the grid when demand is highest, maximising output revenues.

Data centres drive a new wave of power demand

The electricity system is entering a new phase of demand expansion. Data centre construction has accelerated sharply, driven by artificial intelligence adoption across industries.

One review by Rystad Energy found that US data centres are poised to require between 395 and 660 terawatt hours of power by 2035, representing at least 10 per cent of existing demand. The planned sites are often in clusters and cover hundreds of acres, which can put significant strain on the local grid.

To solve this issue, operators are piloting the co-location of data centres and large energy power plants. This represents a lucrative opportunity for renewable energy developers with existing thermal power plants, as they can offer hyperscale data centres sustainability, affordability and reliability by combining renewable and non-renewable assets with BESS.

Renewables are the cleanest way to meet the growing power requirement for data centres. They also have the advantage of speed; solar can be implemented much more quickly than a gas or nuclear power plant. Combining solar with BESS addresses the intermittency issue, leading to comparable electricity generation levels to gas power plants.

Hyperscalers such as Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon still have ambitious carbon-free energy goals. They are prioritising access to clean power resources that are cost-effective while still providing stable electricity.

For investors, this alignment between corporate objectives and the affordability of renewables is producing a new set of opportunities. Partnerships between data centre developers and renewables providers are becoming a growing segment of the renewables market.

Rising industrial energy needs

Another compelling dimension of the US market lies in the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and industry, in part due to investments in high-value semiconductor factories and pharmaceutical facilities.

Industry analyst forecasts suggest US power demand could rise by 15–20 per cent by 2030, driven by industrial electrification and the reshoring of manufacturing. This growth also represents a significant commercial opportunity for solar.

Distributed projects, such as solar panels on the roofs of factories, offer shorter development timelines, lower permitting risk and solutions tailored to customer requirements.

They also offer significant potential for innovation, and may be more feasible in cases where there are land permitting issues for utility-scale projects. This approach also deepens local political support for renewables by embedding economic value in communities.

Looking forward

Combined with BESS, both solar PV and onshore wind can compete with thermal power stations in terms of offering reliable, low-cost electricity generation, with the added benefit of being sustainable.

However, a shift in mindset is needed among hyperscalers and policymakers in the US if they are to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by onshore renewables.

Stable, long-term policy signals — including robust state-level frameworks — are essential. Significant grid upgrades and streamlined permitting are also required to support the necessary scale and free up interconnection and grid queues.

Storage and domestic supply chains will be the linchpins of resilience, and innovative market structures and corporate power purchase agreements will stimulate investment, even in a volatile federal environment.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/f0105cb6-eced-4309-b479-94ace2b25624.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 06:59:25.645804

Want to claim thousands of dollars in federal tax credits for electrification upgrades that slash emissions, reduce air pollution, and enhance the comfort of your home? You have just over a month left to get them installed.

In July, Republicans in Congress voted to end two key home-energy tax credits: the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C), worth up to $2,000 for updates like an über-efficient heat pump; and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D), which takes 30% of the cost of rooftop solar and other clean-energy installations off your federal tax bill. To qualify for the credits, projects have to be done by Dec. 31.

Ditching our fossil-fuel equipment for electric options is an opportunity to land a punch in the climate fight. More than 40% of U.S. energy-related emissions stem from how we heat, cool, and power our homes and fuel our cars, according to the nonprofit Rewiring America. Not to mention, clean alternatives are often cheaper to run than dirty-energy versions.

Still, electrifying our lives can be hard. All-electric home upgrades are often big, complex infrastructure projects. Upfront costs can be steep.

But appliances, like cars, come in a wide range of models with different features and a diversity of price points.

It’s worth spending some time to think through the options — after all, doing so could save you tens of thousands of dollars by avoiding an unnecessary electrical-service upgrade or an overpowered heat pump. But to lock in the federal discounts, you’ll need to get up to speed quickly.

That’s where Canary Media can help. I’ve pulled the most relevant stories from the archives to get you prepped on your home retrofit. Dive in anywhere you like.

Here’s a last piece of advice to help you fast-track electrification projects so that you can get those federal tax credits. Journalist Justin Gerdes, who writes the wonderfully researched newsletter Quitting Carbon, says this is his No. 1 pointer for anyone planning an all-electric home retrofit:

“Search for a specialist electrification contractor you can trust.”

To make that process easier, Rewiring America and the BetterHVAC Alliance launched the National Quality Contractor Network in September. The associated directory is full of certified installers who know and love heat pumps, heat-pump water heaters, insulation, EV chargers, and more.

Gerdes’ advice is golden in a world with or without federal tax breaks. The U.S. government continues to fund state-run home energy rebates for lower- income households. And you can still find a bonanza of state, local, and utility incentives to break up with fossil fuels.

It’s also still early in the adoption curve for many of these electrified technologies. As they become more commonplace, we could see prices drop.

So while now is a great time to invest in electric appliances and reap the benefits of a clean-energy dream home, 2026 — and the years to come — will be too.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/EL-get-all-electric-heat-pumps-solar-and-other-home-energy-upgrades-before-federal-tax-credits-expire.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7d627d2a25fad59b96c15ea5d8e3e516,N,,2025-11-21 04:58:03.631708

Mullen Automotive had recently acquired a 60-percent controlling interest in Bollinger Motors for roughly $148 million.
Despite being in business for over a decade, Bollinger Motors has very little to show for itself.","It’s not looking good for Bollinger Motors. News has emerged that the company is struggling to pay its bills while employees note that their paychecks have been delayed.

According to the Detroit Free Press, internal memos are circulating within the company that pertain to the issue and they’re not particularly encouraging.

""Unfortunately, we could not process this week’s payroll on schedule due to a delay in receiving the expected funds,"" read an email from Walter Collins, the chief operating officer of Bollinger Motors. ""As of today, we do not yet have a confirmed update on funding to meet payroll ending October 31, 2025. As soon as funds are received, we will process payroll in full. I will provide updates as new information becomes available.""

The matter had not been dealt with by the following week and there were several dozen open claims against Bollinger Innovations for unpaid wages or benefits prompting an investigation from the state government.

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg, apparently. Rumor has it that Bollinger’s management has effectively disbanded. This comes after announcements that the business was enacting aggressive cost-cutting measures to reduce overhead at the end of the summer. However, the rumor mill suggests that strategy has failed and the business is effectively out of cash. An insider from the company recently informed The Drive that the offices have basically been cleared out and that nobody is being paid anymore.

From The Drive:

“Bollinger Motors of Oak Park, Michigan and its parent company Bollinger Innovations have completely collapsed,” our tipster told us via email. “All Michigan based senior leadership has been forced out.”

“Employees payroll is weeks behind, with nothing answers being given to employees,” our tipster continued. “There is no operating cash left, and customers/dealers are being lied to.”

Listen, I’ll be the first one to tell you that the current regulatory landscape within the automotive industry seems custom made to deny any change of their ever being fresh competition. New automakers are insanely rare and the few that do emerge these days seem laser-focused on electrification, possibly because they think it’s the only path they can take.

But we’ve also seen countless EV startups go under after making some of the sketchiest financial plays you’ll see within an industry. Many people have accused certain companies of effectively being technology scams. There have been too many situations where a business crops up out of nowhere and makes a bunch of money via some lofty promises.

While the vast majority of these companies eventually go under, quite a few seem to have leadership that manages to get rich by dumping their stocks shortly before share prices tumble. This is after extravagant marketing campaigns and boosted IPOs have made them a bundle of money, of course. Investors cannot seem to help themselves and are often accompanied by special-purpose acquisition companies that always seem to boost the share price beyond what feels rational before everything goes sideways.

We saw this with Nikola, Electric Last Mile Solutions, Lordstown Motors, Canoo, Faraday Future, and plenty of other high-profile EV brands that ultimately didn’t go anywhere. But determining which of those companies had leadership that actually wanted to build vehicles, and which wanted to exploit investors by simply pretending to, isn’t something we can’t easily answer without psychic abilities. Visiting Lordstown Assembly, only to see a lot of underutilized space, helped us make some educated guesses that things weren’t going well.

In the case of Bollinger, the company started out in 2014 as a brand keen to build all-electric utility vehicles and pickup trucks that could handle serious abuse. That’s what drew attention to the brand and it ultimately decided to move away from SUVs on the grounds that the market was quickly becoming saturated and there were more opportunities (and government subsidization) beyond the realm of passenger vehicles.

The brand moved from New York to Michigan and started refocusing on electrified commercial vehicles in 2018. By 2022, any illusion that the original B1 and B2 passenger vehicles would ever be built was gone. Mullen Automotive had recently acquired a 60-percent controlling interest in Bollinger Motors for roughly $148 million.

However, a major financial dispute between founder Robert Bollinger and the company ultimately went into receivership last spring. Mr. Bollinger sued the company on the grounds that he wanted to recoup a $10-million loan issued the previous year. But the matter was settled with Mullen putting up the funds to pay by the following month.

Sadly, this wasn’t the only suit launched against the company this year. Several of its suppliers have also taken legal action to settle accounts to the tune of several million dollars.

With that in mind, what’s happening now seems inevitable. Without continued government funding, it’s hard to make a case for companies to build all-electric trucks, as there will be fewer reasons for other businesses to purchase them. A lot of people do not like to admit that a meaningful portion of the industry behind battery electric vehicles has been propped up by dwindling government incentives and the now-waning hype surrounding technology companies. That doesn’t suggest things will always be this way, especially as the relevant battery tech and infrastructure improves. But it does happen to be the truth at the present moment.

Despite being in business for over a decade, Bollinger Motors has very little to show for itself. The brand’s initial passenger models were never built and most of its commercial vehicles have yet to arrive. Outside of the all-electric B4 (pictured), a Class 4 vehicle that closely resembles an Isuzu NPR box truck, is really the only real product to come out of the business.

We’re wondering if that’s to remain the case indefinitely. Bollinger is now in that make-or-break phase where we’ve seen many EV companies spend the next several years promising that they’re about to turn a corner, only to see it fall further into obscurity as more aggrieved creditors come forward.",https://cdn-fastly.thetruthaboutcars.com/media/2025/11/20/13061/social-45132391.jpg?size=1200x628,N,,2025-11-21 11:03:44.489757

The investments by Detroit-based General Motors (GM) and the Japan-based Toyota Group involve six existing facilities, most of which have metals-intensive aspects to their operations.

GM announced this week that it intends to spend about $250 million at its Parma Metal Center in Parma, Ohio. The automaker says the investment will enable production of sheet metal stampings to support earlier announced investments at assembly plants in Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.

Stamping plants such as the one in Ohio can generate steady amounts of recyclable steel in while automotive production facilities of all kinds also yield recyclable plastic films and old corrugated containers (OCC).

“With this new commitment, GM’s total manufacturing investments for 2025 now approach $5.5 billion, underscoring the company’s aggressive commitment to domestic manufacturing and meeting customer demand across its internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicle (EV) portfolio,” states the company.

The Plano, Texas-based Toyota Motor North America business unit of Toyota earlier this week announced a series of investments in American manufacturing it said carries a $912 million price tag. Toyota says growing its hybrid vehicle production capacity is at the root of those investments.

The $900 million will be invested in facilities in Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia.

The Toyota facility in Blue Springs, Mississippi, has been designated as the assembly plant for a hybrid-electric version of the Toyota Corolla.

Metals casting operations are the focus of investments at Toyota plants in Troy, Missouri, and Jackson, Tennessee.

The Troy casting plant will receive a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles. On its website, Toyota describes the Troy facility as using “recycled aluminum to build thousands of cylinder heads per day.”

The Jackson casting facility’s spending includes the installation of “three all-new production lines” for transaxle cases, housings and engine blocks for hybrid vehicles designed to increase production capacity by nearly 500,000 units annually, says Toyota. The company describes its Jackson plant as “using aluminum to create thousands of engine blocks and transmission cases and housings every day.”

At the Georgetown, Kentucky, plant, an all-new machining line for four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines will be installed, while in Buffalo, West Virginia, increased assembly capacity for four-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, transaxles and rear motor stators comprises the focus of the investment.

“Customers are embracing Toyota’s hybrid vehicles, and our U.S. manufacturing teams are gearing up to meet that growing demand,” says Kevin Voelkel, a senior vice president with the company. “Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/11/21/toyotamfgweb.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 03:59:05.959314

This new technology hopes to change that,"In The NoCo, Erin O'Toole, Brad Turner",,,,,https://www.kunc.org/podcast/inthenoco/2025-11-20/steam-power-isnt-as-clean-as-you-might-think-this-new-technology-hopes-to-change-that,"However, the traditional method of making steam hasn’t changed in more than 150 years.
That boiler brings in water, and you burn a fuel to heat that water up to generate steam.
That super powerful heat pump allows us to take heat from the air, use electricity, and then generate steam as high as 300 up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
So we have a super powerful heat pump that allows us to do that.
But of course, as a beer lover, I love making beer.","Steam powers much of the modern world. It drove the Industrial Revolution, and is still widely used to generate electricity, to sterilize equipment used in food production and medicine, and to heat and cool large buildings.

However, the traditional method of making steam hasn’t changed in more than 150 years. It involves burning fossil fuels like coal or natural gas to heat water in a boiler --, a process which creates harmful emissions.

Which is why Todd Bandhauer felt that the old way was long overdue for an upgrade. He's a professor of mechanical engineering at Colorado State University, and co-founder and chief technical officer of a CSU spinoff company called AtmosZero.

He recently helped develop a method that uses heat from the air, rather than from burning gas or fossil fuels, to make steam generation cleaner. And Bandhauer thinks it could be transformative for manufacturing cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, heating college campuses, and brewing beer.

Earlier this month, Bandhauer was named to the Time 100 Climate list, which recognizes innovations in clean energy.

He joined Erin O’Toole to talk about why making cleaner steam could be transformative for manufacturing around the world – and how it’s already being used at New Belgium Brewing in Fort Collins.

Highlights from the conversation:

O’Toole: Could you briefly walk me through how steam is traditionally made for industrial use?

Bandhauer: For the last 150 years, you use what is called a package boiler. That boiler brings in water, and you burn a fuel to heat that water up to generate steam. That steam comes out of it and then gets transported via pipes all throughout the factory, and then it gets used on all sorts of industrial processes — like making beer.

O’Toole: And help us picture: how much does steam contribute to carbon emissions and climate change?

Bandhauer: About 8% of all the world's energy used every year is to make steam. It's probably about a third of all the energy used to transport people around — cars, buses, trains, airplanes. It’s on that same order of magnitude, so it's a huge amount.

O’Toole: So your mission was to try to find a new way to generate steam that would cut back greatly on these harmful emissions, and you discovered that a heat pump could replace these traditional fossil fuel powered boilers in very basic terms. Can you explain how this works?

Bandhauer: I think most people know what a heat pump is: Heat pumps are used in houses to basically heat when it's cold outside. What we're making is a super powerful heat pump. That super powerful heat pump allows us to take heat from the air, use electricity, and then generate steam as high as 300 up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. So you don't need to generate that high of a temperature for your house. But for industry, you need way, way higher temperatures. So we have a super powerful heat pump that allows us to do that.

O’Toole: How big is your device and how is it different from a heat pump for homes?

Bandhauer: It basically would provide heat for a whole neighborhood of folks. So not just a single house. The unit that we have in New Belgium probably could heat about 50 homes. So that's the order of magnitude that we're talking about.

O’Toole: What are the biggest challenges to getting this adopted on a wide scale?

Bandhauer: The boiler hasn't been reinvented for 150 years, and so the problem that we're addressing is we want to make it easy for all of our customers to make the switch. We really want to avoid disrupting the process industrial factories. They're 24/7, 365 days a year; if you shut them down for a few hours, they lose money. They lose a lot of money. And so we want to make it as easy as possible. For example, at New Belgium, we connected our system to their facility, opened up a valve, started generating steam, and then their boilers that they had on site were just turned down. And they just kept operating. We want to make sure there's zero interruptions at all to the process.

O’Toole: What kind of industry do you hope will be the next to give this technology a try?

Bandhauer: I think the food and beverage market in general is really ripe for this change. Think cooking. Think cleaning pipes for milk production. Think all sorts of sterilization processes. But of course, as a beer lover, I love making beer. It's incredible.

O’Toole: Attention beer makers!

Bandhauer: Yes, exactly. You know, we're in an old manufacturing facility here in Loveland, Colorado. We're at the Forge campus here on the south side of Loveland, and we are working to re-energize manufacturing here in Colorado. And so it's just really exciting and special to be a part of that.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ae698db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F5c%2F530c3aba4e729a67578608cb1fd8%2Fthumbnail-todd-bandhauer-csu-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 06:59:19.895492

The Climate Council has undertaken rapid analysis of these proposed amendments and why they would fail on climate.

The five reasons a Coalition deal on environment law would fail on climate:

Climate accountability gutted: climate impacts would be completely ignored in approval decisions – even though climate change is the greatest threat to Australia’s environment.

Free pass for polluting fossil fuel projects: By rejecting any inclusion of climate, the Coalition’s approach effectively gives new coal and gas developments a free ride through approvals. Under this deal, mega-polluting fossil fuel projects would continue to be approved unchecked by climate considerations and no guardrails would be put in place to prevent the fast-tracking of fossil fuels.

Undermines an independent EPA reducing accountability of project impacts.

Dilutes key guardrails and safeguards designed to protect our environment: including the ‘net gain’ and definition of ‘unacceptable impact’, that are crucial to stopping irreparable environmental damage and ensuring developments leave nature better off.

Fails to fix logging loopholes and land clearing exemptions that are currently contributing to the destruction of our native forests and critical habitat.

In contrast to the Coalition, the Greens’ key demands have been reported as:

A strong, independent EPA

An end to native forest logging – such as closing existing loopholes

Adequate protections for critical habitat, including from land clearing

Consideration of climate impacts to some degree (even if a ‘climate trigger’ is off the table)

No fast-tracks for polluting coal or gas projects

No wholesale handover to states of approvals – including the water trigger

Rapid analysis of Coalition deal

Watering down climate pollution information provided by companies and the requirement for companies to make plans to reduce climate pollution

Climate accountability gutted: A Coalition deal would explicitly exclude emissions disclosure and consideration of direct climate pollution from projects. This would represent an abject failure to address climate change or climate harms in any way, and risk undermining Australia’s climate targets, policies like the Safeguard Mechanism and Australia’s international commitments.

Emissions disclosure requirements and plans to reduce pollution would either be gutted completely, or left toothless – in direct contradiction to the recommendations of the Samuel Review of the EPBC Act, which recommended disclosure of “the full emissions of the development”.

This would leave our national environment law completely out of step with existing emissions disclosure requirements (that include Scope 3) in many states i.e. Environmental assessments in both New South Wales and Queensland, Environmental assessments from the Federal offshore oil and gas regulator NOPSEMA, and the Albanese Government’s own climate-related financial disclosure framework.

Fossil fuel projects given a free pass: By rejecting climate safeguards, the Coalition’s approach effectively gives new coal and gas developments a free ride through approvals. There would be no obligation to assess whether a proposed mine or gas field undermines Australia’s climate targets, nor any ban on fast‑tracking polluting projects

No guardrails against fast tracking of fossil fuels

There are currently several approval pathways in the bill that could inadvertently enable this – such as the streamlined assessment pathway, the bioregional plans, state accreditation pathways and NOPSEMA. A deal with the Coalition doesn’t set any guardrails at all to ensure polluting coal and gas projects aren’t fast-tracked, alongside the environmentally responsible clean energy and housing projects Australia needs.

The Minister retaining responsibilities, particularly around the assessment and approval of projects, and weakening the EPA’s ability to enforce the rules

Undermining an independent EPA: A core Coalition condition is to weaken the new independent Environmental Protection Agency. They want to extend political control over the EPA’s leadership – for example, by giving the minister power to sack the EPA’s CEO. This undermines the whole point of an independent watchdog. Effective oversight requires a strong, arms-length EPA. The new EPA must be free to enforce the rules without fear of political interference, otherwise environmental protections will be hollow.

Reinstating streamlined approval pathways that industries are demanding

This prioritises approval pathways and efficiency for business and industries over environmental protection.

It is noteworthy that the Coalition supports the creation of more approval pathways, when this law is supposed to reduce complexity and avoid duplication.

This is about industry trying to have a foot in both camps: if the fast lane doesn’t work for them, then they want to keep a back door open.

Redefining or watering down the “unacceptable impact” safeguard

Dilution of the ‘unacceptable impact’ safeguard: The reforms propose a new test to block projects that would cause “unacceptable impacts” on protected matters – a crucial safeguard to stop irreparable environmental damage. The Coalition appears to be attempting to water this down by weakening the definition or making it easier for decision-makers to bypass.

This test needs to be strong and objective, not weaker: it should clearly condition or prevent projects that would irreversibly harm critical ecosystems or drive species extinctions.

Redefining or diluting the concept of “net gain”

The Coalition also objects to provisions requiring developments to leave nature better off. Notably, they oppose the “net gain” requirement – a rule that any environmental damage from a project must be more than offset by repairs or improvements elsewhere.

If this requirement is watered down or scrapped, companies could tick a box with token efforts that don’t actually make up for the harm done. The result? Big projects go ahead, while our wildlife and ecosystems continue to decline.

Weaker penalties

A watered down penalty regime: Reduced accountability and compliance – letting industries/projects that break the rules or cause environmental damage off lighter by reducing penalties.

Nothing on the table regarding native forest logging, or land clearing

A deal with the Coalition would leave a gaping hole in the law by keeping native forest logging exempt from federal oversight. Right now, logging conducted under Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) isn’t subject to the EPBC Act at all – and the Coalition is not prepared to change that. This means destructive logging of our native forest could continue without meeting national environmental standards or scrutiny by the new EPA.

This decades-old loophole must be closed to protect wildlife and carbon-rich forests. A deal with the Coalition would perpetuate business-as-usual logging, undermining the credibility of any “once-in-a-generation” reform. Graeme Samuel himself strongly critiqued these exemptions for forestry, describing them as “untenable loopholes” in the context of strengthening Australia’s environmental laws. The deal also preserves a free pass for continued land clearing – exactly the kind of loophole that has contributed to Australia’s nature emergency.",https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/climate-impacts.png,N,,2025-11-21 02:58:13.787626

Final thoughts The tasks ahead for the next DEP commissioner are not unique to New Jersey.
The next DEP commissioner will serve Gov.","In the lead-up to New Jersey’s gubernatorial election, NJ Spotlight News invited former top aides and state commissioners to pen some bipartisan advice for their incoming successors. Here is guidance from two former state Department of Environmental Protection commissioners, one from a Democratic administration, the other from a Republican.

In a dramatically upended policy, funding, and political landscape, the next commissioner of New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will face on behalf of incoming Gov. Mikie Sherrill unprecedented challenges in protecting New Jersey’s environment and natural resources.

DEP has throughout its history worked in close partnership with counterparts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Interior, Department of Commerce, and Department of Agriculture. Even where DEP’s policy has diverged from or conflicted with its federal counterparts – New Jersey often sets tougher standards and pilots innovative new approaches before other states and the federal government – federal-state tensions typically have been inconsequential to a relationship historically described as “cooperative federalism.” That has been true regardless of which party controls the White House, Congress, or Statehouse.

No more. At a panel recently convened by the nonpartisan Environmental Law Institute, current and former environmental commissioners or secretaries from both red states and blue states discussed how the fundamental pillars of “cooperative federalism” are at hazard. They cited the pending and anticipated cuts in funding to New Jersey and other states implementing federal programs, the dismantling of core federal research and enforcement programs relied on by states, and pending litigation by the Trump administration that could strip states of much of their longstanding authority

But not all of the challenges will come from Washington, and the disrupted federal-state relationship will create opportunities for New Jersey and the next DEP commissioner to burnish New Jersey’s longstanding reputation for nation-leading policy leadership.

NJDEP at the center of the affordability storm

Over the years, New Jersey’s leadership has been especially prominent in addressing the challenges of climate and energy policy. DEP’s statutory mandate to reduce climate-damaging emissions through a clean-energy transition has been hampered by volatile natural gas prices, delayed deployment and public opposition to offshore wind, uncertainty concerning vehicle emission standards, and the Trump administration’s claw-back of incentives and funding for energy efficiency, renewables, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.

Both major candidates running for governor this year decried what they described as an energy “affordability crisis.” They were correct, and solutions — more nuclear plants and gas pipelines, faster deployment of offshore wind — are complex and challenging and will require long term policy, political, and financial efforts to provide needed relief to families and businesses facing higher utility bills.

The Legislature already mandates procurement of electricity from New Jersey’s existing nuclear capacity, and there is little prospect that significant new nuclear capacity can come online in time to affect prices in the next governor’s first or even second term. The state already is also overly dependent on natural gas for electricity, and any new gas pipelines or plants would go online just as major Biden-approved expansions in gas export capacity create vast new demand from overseas, inevitably increasing prices.

The Trump administration’s aggressive — and arguably unlawful — interference in renewables deployment will continue to delay New Jersey consumers’ access to the cheapest, cleanest and most readily available forms of energy.

The real solutions for energy affordability lie in the technical weeds and will take time. They are strategies like upgraded transmission, more distributed generation and storage, new reforms to speed clean energy deployment, and changes to a utility model that currently rewards increases in peak demand, when prices and utility profits are highest.

The next DEP commissioner will need to work urgently and in close partnership with the Board of Public Utilities president both to show continued progress in meeting New Jersey’s clean air mandates and to stave off inevitable political pressure to weaken those mandates in purported response to affordability concerns.

A world (mostly) without federal agency partners

The draconian staff and funding cuts implemented by the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have effectively hobbled EPA as a supporting partner to DEP. That will present a range of challenges for the next DEP commissioner.

DEP has long been delegated federal authority to run major programs under the federal Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act. But those programs have relied heavily on standards that EPA sets through federal rules. New Jersey often sets more protective standards and regulates specific health and environmental threats before EPA does, as has been the case with standards for arsenic, mercury, and so-called “forever chemicals” (or PFAS) in drinking water. But even such state-led initiatives rely heavily on guidance and supporting research by EPA federal agencies, now decimated in terms of staffing.

In addition, entire EPA offices that provide needed support to DEP in implementing New Jersey’s landmark but to date largely unimplemented “environmental justice” law have been eliminated entirely, including EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and Office of Civil Rights. The long-sought law inspired expectations of relief in the low-income communities and those of color that have borne the brunt of the Garden State’s industrial pollution and now face the greatest threats from climate change.

Of greatest concern are when major spills or lawbreaking affecting New Jersey’s environment are beyond DEP’s capacity or state jurisdiction, and it is unclear that any federal response will be forthcoming to support DEP.

Who will answer the call when the Garden State is hit by disasters like 2004’s Athos I spill of more than 260,000 gallons of crude oil onto 280 miles of Delaware River shoreline; or the devastation of 2012’s Hurricane Sandy, where 38 lives were lost, 2 million residents lost power, and New Jersey suffered $30 billion in economic damages?

A crisis in environmental funding

The states that are implementing regulatory authority delegated to them by EPA have always relied on federal grants to cover their costs in assuming those programs. In New Jersey’s case, that has been primarily support for salaries of DEP scientists, engineers, and technicians administering major permitting programs. If those funds and consequently DEP staff are reduced, air and water permits that already take too long to process or renew will take even longer, impairing both environmental protection and economic development.

The next DEP commissioner will also have to navigate cuts to the combined federal and state water infrastructure loans that enable cities and towns to finance clean water and safe drinking water infrastructure projects.

The next DEP commissioner will also have to navigate cuts to the combined federal and state water infrastructure loans that enable cities and towns to finance clean water and safe drinking water infrastructure projects. These funds have been essential to addressing legacy threats, like replacing ancient lead drinking water service lines, and emerging threats driven by more extreme weather, like the more intense rains driven by climate change that are overwhelming local stormwater and wastewater infrastructure.

The next commissioner also must speed the deployment of vast sums DEP already has in hand. Within the last few months, New Jersey has recovered approximately $2.5 billion from DuPont and $500 million from 3M for PFAS contamination of New Jersey waters. DEP has historically been laggard in getting those funds to worthy projects. Capably and promptly deploying those funds – and ensuring they are not diverted by the Legislature to other purposes – gives the next commissioner an unprecedented opportunity to create an enduring legacy for the governor in improving the state’s watersheds and drinking water supply, while helping cities and towns that need to protect their residents from health-threatening PFAS exposure.

Rethinking environmental protection

The damage the Trump administration is doing to regulatory processes and law enforcement will be largely irreparable. A generation of scientists, health professionals, engineers, planners, and attorneys has been dismissed or diverted from public service in the federal government.

But no candidate of either political party will be elected to public office promising to restore the regulatory system just as it was circa 2024. Nor should they. Without in any way validating what President Trump is doing, the next DEP commissioner should launch and help lead the development and piloting of better modes of environmental protection and innovative approaches to adapting to the extreme weather we can no longer prevent.

This opportunity will necessarily be fraught. Changes to any DEP regulation will raise bitter memories for environmentalists of deregulatory efforts under New Jersey’s “open for business” credo in the 1990s and the early 2000s debate over a “fast track” permitting law that in the end was never implemented.

But as the energy affordability debate highlights, outdated rules often stand in the way of climate, environmental, affordability and economic progress. For example, DEP’s slow and sclerotic regulatory processes — based on the federal model — have enabled chemical companies to mass-produce toxic new compounds entering our air, water, drinking water and bloodstreams faster than DEP can regulate or prohibit them under statutes and practices that have largely been unchanged for decades, and at the same time have slowed or blocked much-needed affordable housing and commercial/industrial projects.

As a climate-vulnerable coastal state, New Jersey will also face new threats from increases in polluted runoff driven by intense rains to increases in soot and smog attributable to a warming atmosphere. The next DEP commissioner will have the opportunity to craft much-needed responses to these threats and will need to resolve the vexing land use questions that will arise as climate reshapes our coastlines and property boundaries. Also important, the next commissioner will have to lead and mediate a statewide dialogue on those rules that govern whether rebuilding or retreat is in the best interests of public safety and equity.

Final thoughts

The tasks ahead for the next DEP commissioner are not unique to New Jersey. But New Jersey and DEP’s talented career staff have always played an outsized role in forging solutions. That role will be even greater given the scale of the challenges and opportunities before the next administration.

The next DEP commissioner will serve Gov. Sherrill best by catalyzing the changes needed to sustain and expand the Garden State’s longstanding environmental leadership.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/11/campbelldaggett.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 01:57:54.891743

The Information, an IT media outlet, reported on the 20th (local time) that SoftBank will acquire an electric vehicle plant in Rose Town, Ohio, and convert it into an equipment manufacturing facility for AI data centers. Softbank secured the site from General Motors (GM) and Foxconn in August this year and plans to start production in the first quarter of next year.

The equipment that Softbank will produce is characterized by ""modular type."" It is a method of quickly assembling and installing core modules at the site after completing the manufacturing and basic tests at the factory. The industry believes that applying a modular structure can shorten the entire process required to operate the data center from 12 months to 7 to 8 months, and that it will improve the speed by 10% to 20% on a schedule. SoftBank will supply the equipment to an open AI data center in Millum County, Texas, and additional sites that have not yet been disclosed.

OpenAI is expanding its manufacturing base on its own. On the 20th, OpenAI announced a plan to directly produce core components of data centers such as power, networking, and cooling in the United States in cooperation with Taiwan's Foxconn. Although Foxconn is well known as an iPhone assembly company, it is considered a suitable partner for OpenAI's infrastructure expansion strategy as it is expanding into AI server rack manufacturing and high-performance electronic module production.

The two companies have developed multiple generations of AI servers in parallel to speed up supply, and Foxconn is responsible for production using factories in the United States such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Indiana.

These tactics include not only climate denial, but also leveraging processes and arguments that lead to lengthy delays in action, greenwashing, advocating for ineffective policies, and spreading disinformation. This research explains the playbooks used by companies, whole sectors, and governments to avoid having to reduce emissions, and suggests regulations, public literacy efforts, and litigation options that can counter this ongoing obstruction.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.
A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.","(The Center Square) – Recent public comments from various industry and local government organizations to the Department of Ecology on a new program intended to help reduce the costs of switching to electric vehicles reiterated prior concerns, including logistical challenges, with EV mandates.

Washington state has adopted several California regulatory policies such as the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks. The goal is to have 100% light-duty EV sales by 2035, when it will be illegal to register a new gasoline-powered vehicle with the Department of Licensing. ACT requires that EV trucks make up an increasingly higher percentage of sales until they reach 75% by 2035.

However, in a public comment to the Department of Ecology, Washington Oil Marketers Association Executive Director Lea McCullough wrote that “we believe the ACT regulation, as currently constructed presents significant legal, economic, and operational problems that must be addressed before any further enforcement or implementation proceeds.”

McCullough cited numerous issues previously raised by others such as the Washington Trucking Associations, including the higher price tag for an EV truck compared to a diesel truck.

“Washington state should prioritize improving the efficiency and emissions profile of existing fuel infrastructure by encouraging the adoption of advanced, low-emission fossil fuel technologies – such as renewable diesel, cleaner-burning gasoline blends and investment in pipeline safety and modern fleet upgrades – rather than mandating ZEVs or imposing energy choice on consumers,” she wrote.

In addition to higher prices compared to regular vehicles, EVs also have a shorter distance before they have to recharge. The WTA said in its public comment that charging can take as long as 90 minutes to achieve a 200-mile range battery charge, whereas diesel trucks can fuel up in half an hour and go 1,500 miles or more before having to refuel.

“A severe lack of public charging infrastructure for heavy trucks, coupled with challenges in installing private charging at leased properties, insufficient truck parking, and potential strain on local communities,” the WTA public comment stated.

A similar sentiment was expressed by Association of Washington Business Government Affairs Director Ken Short in a public comment.

“Numerous studies have shown that with the need to charge an EV truck during the course of the day, they simply do not match the efficiency of conventional trucks which often will have no need to stop even once during a shift,” he said. “Washington does not currently have the infrastructure needed to comply with the model that ACT envisions. We hope there will be consideration to proposals from industry partners that can assist in meeting a transition to lower emissions without significant disruptions to WA’s business community.”

Travis Nelson with the WA PUD Association wrote in a public comment that these logistical limitations makes them impractical for utility providers to adequately respond in the aftermath of storms, such as one recently that resulted in 200,000 customers losing power and caused local flooding due to blocked drain systems.

Nelson warned that “the current ZEV (zero emission vehicle) capabilities are not adequate to support these operations that often require hundreds of miles of travel to reach neighboring communities in need of regional assistance outside the local area in need. Please exempt Utility Service Vehicles from the zero emission vehicle requirements.”

Carly Michiels with the Washington Public Ports Association emphasized in a public comment to the Department of Ecology the importance of adequate infrastructure and energy supply, “while maintaining efficient freight movement and trade competitiveness.”

“We already know that we will be facing a significant regional energy resource gap starting in 2026,” Michiels wrote. “Addressing this needs to be top priority.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/98/6985020c-f120-4142-a30f-c1e5b47e836f/691f959e07ea0.preview.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 23:00:32.427740

Higher steel prices, equipment delays, and shifting procurement strategies are all reshaping upstream and midstream investment patterns.
And if crude oil is ever added to the tariff schedule, the pressure would shift dramatically.","President Trump’s tariff strategy in his second term has touched almost every corner of the economy, but few sectors have felt the effects as unevenly as oil and gas. The administration has chosen not to apply tariffs to crude oil, natural gas, or refined fuel imports—yet upstream, midstream, and refining companies are still dealing with higher costs from steel, aluminum, and other essential materials. The disconnect means that the feedstock remains tariff-free, while the infrastructure needed to produce and process it is becoming more expensive.

Equipment Costs and Supply Chains: The Pressure is Upstream and Midstream

The most immediate pain point is cost inflation on equipment and materials. The current tariff package includes:

A 25% tariff on most goods from Canada and Mexico

A 10% tariff on Chinese imports

Expanded duties on steel and aluminum

For an industry that sources everything from line pipe to control systems globally, these tariffs show up quickly. Steel is the biggest factor. Drill pipe, casing, gathering lines, transmission lines, LNG tanks, refinery vessels, structural steel—almost every piece of hard infrastructure depends on it.

Offshore Magazine reported that these tariffs are expected to add 2–5% to offshore project costs, contributing to a growing list of operators delaying or renegotiating capital plans. Ernst & Young reached a similar conclusion, noting that even with strong political support for domestic drilling, steel tariffs continue to introduce planning risk, especially for multi-year projects and deepwater developments.

Chinese tariffs affect a different layer of the supply chain: electrical gear, valves, sensors, sub-sea electronics, and even the AI-enabled drilling controls now common in shale operations. When operators are budgeting tightly, a few percentage points of cost inflation can move a drilling program from “marginal” to “uneconomical.”

Crude Oil Imports: Explicitly Exempt

Unlike equipment and materials, crude oil, LNG, NGLs, gasoline, diesel, and other refined products were formally excluded from the new tariff structure. Energy Connects and Reuters confirmed in April 2025 that the White House exempted crude and fuel imports from the 10% baseline tariff and from the higher partner-specific tariffs.

The reasoning is straightforward:

Refineries depend on imported crude. Gulf Coast refineries were built to run medium and heavy crudes which isn’t a great match for domestic shale. Taxing imported crude would upend refinery economics and reduce throughput.

Fuel prices are politically sensitive. A crude import tariff would show up at the pump within days, and no administration wants to explain a sudden 20–40 cent jump in gasoline during an election year.

Targeted measures do exist—most notably a 25% tariff on Russian oil tied to broader sanctions—but these are narrow and geopolitical in nature, not part of a broad policy shift.

The Refinery Consequences If Crude Oil Is Tariffed

It’s worth considering the counterfactual, because the industry understands exactly how disruptive a crude tariff would be.

Gulf Coast refineries would take the biggest hit.

Texas and Louisiana host the world’s largest concentration of complex refineries designed for heavy blends—traditionally sourced from Latin America, Canada, and the Middle East. A 10–25% tariff on those barrels would:

Raise feedstock costs immediately

Push some refineries to run at lower utilization

Narrow or even erase refining margins on heavy crude slates

Even a 10% tariff could wipe out profitability for plants optimized for discounted foreign grades.

U.S. fuel prices would rise sharply.

Since imported crude makes up a meaningful share of refinery inputs, a tariff would move through the system quickly:

Higher crude costs lead to higher wholesale product costs

Higher wholesale costs lead to higher pump prices

Gasoline could rise anywhere from 10 to 40 cents per gallon, depending on the tariff level and the mix of crudes affected.

Exports would fall, and the U.S. could lose market share.

The U.S. is one of the world’s largest exporters of refined products. A crude tariff would raise the cost of production, making American gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel less competitive in Latin America and Europe.

It could unintentionally raise global oil prices.

If U.S. imports fell because tariffs distorted economics, producers elsewhere would shift barrels to other buyers at higher prices. The global market would tighten, and Brent could drift upward.

Refinery closures could result.

Several refineries have shut down over the past decade. A tariff-driven margin squeeze could accelerate that trend, especially for older Gulf Coast or East Coast plants.

This is precisely why both the first and second Trump administrations have avoided taxing crude imports: doing so would disrupt refinery operations, raise fuel prices, and undermine the U.S. energy advantage.

Strategic Implications for 2025–2026

Even without crude tariffs, the tariff environment has impacted U.S. oil and gas:

Project timelines are slipping as operators re-price materials.

Break-evens are creeping up, especially in shale plays that rely on imported steel.

Retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico add friction to supply chains for valves, pumps, and assembled equipment.

Refiners remain stable for now, but only because crude imports were spared.

If the administration ever decides to revisit the crude exemption, the consequences would be immediate and far-reaching.

Conclusion: A Policy That Spares Oil but Strains the System

Trump’s tariff policy has created a strange split in the energy economy. On one hand, the administration has deliberately shielded crude oil and refined product imports from new duties, preserving the supply chains that keep U.S. refineries competitive and fuel markets relatively stable. On the other hand, the same tariff regime has raised the cost of building and maintaining the very infrastructure that keeps the system running. Higher steel prices, equipment delays, and shifting procurement strategies are all reshaping upstream and midstream investment patterns.

The result is an industry absorbing indirect blows even as its core feedstock remains untouched. And if crude oil is ever added to the tariff schedule, the pressure would shift dramatically. Refiners—especially complex Gulf Coast facilities built to process heavier foreign grades—would face higher costs, narrower margins, and operational constraints that would ripple through gasoline and diesel markets. It is an outcome policymakers have so far avoided for good reason.

For now, the message is clear: tariffs may not touch the barrel, but they touch almost everything around it. The age-old question remains whether the industry can continue to adapt faster than the policy landscape shifts beneath it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/691e53043c54cb586d8ac34f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-21 01:58:18.206473

Excluding wildfires and winds blown from overseas, the EPA says the area has already met the standards.
From 2021 to 2023, the metro averaged 54 high ozone days per year.
The Valley of the Sun is particularly susceptible to high ozone days thanks to its extreme heat and high levels of industrial and vehicle emissions.
The EPA itself estimates that around 4 million people in the Phoenix area are chronically exposed to ozone pollution.","PHOENIX (CN) — As air quality in the Phoenix metro worsens, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency floated a novel suggestion this week: Exempt the area from Clean Air Act requirements because much of the valley’s air pollution is out of its control.

The agency proposed the solution Wednesday, one day before a federal judge approved a consent decree requiring the city to act on ozone pollution in the Phoenix-Mesa metro area by Feb. 3, 2026. Excluding wildfires and winds blown from overseas, the EPA says the area has already met the standards.

Members of the public now have until Dec. 19 to comment on the proposal.

“It’s outrageous that the Trump EPA wants to use international emissions as an excuse to do nothing instead of reducing the dangerous smog Phoenix residents are forced to breathe every day,” Benjamin Rankin, an associate attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a press release. “People in the Phoenix metro area can push back and demand that the Trump administration act aggressively and urgently to reduce unhealthy pollution rather than pander to the polluters causing it.”

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set “national ambient air quality standards” for pollutants such as ozone, commonly known as smog. The EPA set air standards for ozone in 2015 and found Phoenix-Mesa to be out of attainment, but missed its deadline to determine reattainment status in 2024, prompting environmental groups to sue this year.

In its annual “State of the Air” report, the American Lung Association ranked the Phoenix-Mesa area as fourth worst out of more than 225 metros for high ozone days. From 2021 to 2023, the metro averaged 54 high ozone days per year. The acceptable standard is three.

The metro also ranks 28th for 24-hour particle pollution and 20th for annual particle pollution.

The Valley of the Sun is particularly susceptible to high ozone days thanks to its extreme heat and high levels of industrial and vehicle emissions. But the pollution floating over the country’s hottest cities is often worsened by California wildfire smoke and, in larger quantities, air blown from overseas.

Though it’s difficult to accurately track, some estimate that as much as 80% of the metro’s pollution comes from overseas. Excluding high fire days and foreign pollutants, the EPA claims in its proposal the metro likely would have attained Clean Air Act compliance as earlier as 2020, and shouldn’t be held responsible for what is out of its control.

Origin aside, environmentalists say the agency has a responsibility to do more to protect vulnerable Americans.

People exposed to excess ozone are at risk of reduced lung function and increased respiratory problems like asthma. The EPA itself estimates that around 4 million people in the Phoenix area are chronically exposed to ozone pollution.

Ozone also causes widespread environmental harms by stunting tree growth, damaging leaves and increasing plants’ susceptibility to disease, insect damage and harsh weather.

“It’s high time that the Trump administration took action to protect people from disease-causing ozone pollution, especially children and the elderly, who are most vulnerable,” Shakoora Azimi-Gaylon, senior director of toxic exposures and pollution prevention at the Center for Environmental Health, said in the press release. “It’d be a shame if the EPA only stops sitting on its hands just to let Phoenix off the hook for its ozone problem. We must continue to fight for clean air for the millions of people living in Phoenix.”

The Maricopa Association of Governments, representing 27 cities and towns in Phoenix’s home county, presented a list of potential solutions to the Legislature in 2023, anticipating a failure to attain compliance. Suggestions included decreasing allowed nitrogen oxide emissions and implementing idling reduction technologies in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks and school buses, incentives to buy partial-zero and zero emission light-duty vehicles, and replacing gas-fired heaters, boilers and cooking appliances with electric appliances.

But Republicans on the committee turned their nose at what they called “draconian” restrictions, and never acted on the proposal.

More recently, the city of Phoenix committed to planting nearly 30,000 new trees over the next five years to reduce heat and improve air quality.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2023/08/temperature-sign-phoenix.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-11-21 03:58:58.207305

The UHP601300 LFP 22 cell, developed with support from Germany’s Federal Ministry of Research, Technology, and Space under the “HEADLINE” project, targets mobility applications including electric vehicles, as well as marine, railway and construction machinery.

The cell delivers a continuous discharge specific power of 2,550 W/kg, about 60 percent higher than cells with conventional electrolytes, and a 2-second pulse discharge of 3,760 W/kg, a 10 percent improvement. The cell also demonstrates a cycle life of 2,400 at a 5 °C charge/discharge rate at room temperature before retaining 80 percent of its initial capacity, with 22 Ah capability and 24-minute full charge and discharge cycles at 110 A current. The reduced internal resistance leads to lower heat generation and improved energy efficiency.

Permitting delays are among the top issues causing solar projects to be cancelled in the United States. The good news is that forward-thinking legislators are advocating for policies that help cut the red tape preventing many Americans from going solar.

Advocates from Massachusetts and Alaska joined Utah State Representative Raymond Ward and California State Senator Scott Wiener, who highlighted recent state policy victories and emerging solar technologies coming to American markets.

Johanna Neumann, Senior Director of the 100% Renewable Campaign at Environment America, discussed the benefits of rooftop solar, the roadblocks that unnecessary red tape presents for constituents and solar installers, and how policies like “instant” permitting can help solve those problems.

Instant solar permitting allows solar installers to get permits online instantaneously; the process applies building codes consistently across projects. In jurisdictions that have adopted solar permitting, installations and inspections are faster while inspection failure rates decline– all while saving time and money.

Senator Wiener is a long-time champion of policies that enable solar energy. He sponsored California Senate Bill 379, which requires most of the state’s cities and counties to adopt instant permitting. The policy helped bring greater consistency to solar permitting across the state while streamlining previously cumbersome processes to enable more Californians to go solar faster.

Plug-in solar, a newer technology gaining traction in the American market, has become commonplace in Germany. During this event, Alaska Environment Director Dyani Chapman gave attendees a brief overview of plug-in solar technology – including its limitations and potential.

Plug-in solar goes by a few different names. Some call it “balcony solar” or “backyard solar”, others “plug-and-play”, but no matter what we call it, some legislators are paying attention to how it develops in the U.S.

Utah State Representative Raymond Ward recently sponsored a bill that passed unanimously through the Utah State legislature exempting plug-in solar from traditional interconnection agreements. Utility interconnection agreements are appropriate for solar installations that export power to the grid, but in the case of plug-in solar, which is designed not to power anything outside the household, those requirements add costs and administrative processes for a resoundingly safe technology.

So, Utah’s legislature voted unanimously for Representative Ward’s plug-in solar bill, opening up a new realm of solar potential in the state. New technologies bring new challenges, but they also bring new potential.

But the US is not entirely absent from global discussions.

—

While the federal government is absent from formal negotiations at this month’s COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, the US is still holding bilateral discussions onsite through an independent association of federally elected officials.

The Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), which represents more than 180 members of the US House of Representatives, aims to deploy them in their “soft power” role to promote climate action. Although the 17 members of Congress who prepared to go to COP30 were forced to remain home to vote on the US government shutdown, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island did attend – the only US federal representative in Belém.

“The US is not a monolith,” Max Frankel, Executive Director of SEEC Institute, told Earth.Org. “We are made up of millions of people and cities and states. Is the US taking climate action? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. There is still a vibrant action from the innovation sector, from the tech sector, from cities and states.”

Meanwhile, individual US states and their leaders – most prominently California governor and likely US presidential contender Gavin Newsom – are participating at a subnational level. The governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham, also participated at the event.

Just as important as bringing a US voice to COP30 is the role of SEEC and the state representatives in bringing the messages about climate change back to the US.

“[The state representatives] are here to tell their story but also to learn from other organizations and other countries. They always learn great things, hear about initiatives that are happening in other parts of the world that they can also take back home to their jurisdiction and work to implement them,” said Holm.

One state committed to forging ahead on climate action is New Mexico. Andrea Desiree Romero, a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives, told Earth.Org, “States are acting independently of our federal landscape to show we’re still part of the cause. We’re committed to an energy transition where we are a net zero carbon emitter by 2045, with a 50% reduction by 2035. We’re doing a lot on the energy investment side, and we have a huge startup community in the advanced energy space. We have $1 billion in venture capital for new company investments in spaces that help us solve these problems.”

Travis Kellerman, Senior Advisor in the New Mexico Energy Department, said the state is “stepping in.”

“When we see what’s happening at the federal level, which has pulled out of their commitments and their funding, we see that the power of democracy is starting to shift to the states. This includes state policy, financing mechanisms, tax credits and incentives following the loss of the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. The idea that the federal government has to lead is not true – New Mexico has a small population but an out-sized impact in global energy,” Kellerman told Earth.Org.

Although the US will no longer abide by its previous formal climate plan, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which the Biden administration submitted late last year, individual states have set NDCs.

“Definitive NDCs from the states that match the Obama-era NDC include 26 states, representing 60% of the US GDP and similar amount of emissions. That’s 50% of the US population. It’s a bright spot to be able to show and tell,” Kellerman said.

Federal appellate courts are currently confronting pivotal questions about hazardous substance designations, cultural natural resource damages, and judicial oversight of EPA settlements.

D.C. Circuit to Hear PFAS CERCLA Hazardous Substance Designation

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments in early 2026 in a high-profile case challenging the EPA’s designation of two PFAS—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)—as hazardous substances under CERCLA Section 102. This marks the first time the EPA has used this provision to regulate a substance through rulemaking.

The case — Chamber of Commerce of the United States et al. v. EPA — is drawing widespread attention due to its potential to set precedent for how PFAS are regulated and how CERCLA is interpreted going forward. The D.C. Circuit has scheduled oral arguments for January 20, 2026, emphasizing that the date is fixed unless modified by court order.

Although the rule was finalized under the Biden administration, the Trump-era EPA has opted to defend it. However, industry challengers, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and six other organizations, argue in a Nov. 14 reply brief that the rule is legally flawed and cannot be salvaged by future regulatory reforms.

Specifically, they point to EPA’s admission that its interpretation of the phrase “may present substantial danger” lacks a clear regulatory framework. While the agency intends to issue a “Framework Rule” to guide future designations and incorporate cost considerations, the challengers argue that such efforts come “too late” to validate the current rule.

9th Circuit Considers Cultural NRD Claims in Cross-Border Dispute

In a parallel Superfund battle, the 9th Circuit is reviewing an en banc petition in Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation v. Teck Cominco Metals, where Canadian officials and industry groups are backing efforts to overturn a panel ruling that permitted Washington State tribes to seek Natural Resources Damages (NRD) for cultural harms caused by toxic discharges into the Columbia River.

Teck Cominco, a Canadian mining firm, is seeking to avoid liability under CERCLA for releases from its smelter upstream in British Columbia. In amicus briefs filed in November, the Province of British Columbia and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce argue that applying CERCLA to cultural harms would violate Canadian sovereignty and expose foreign entities to sweeping liabilities under U.S. environmental laws. The Mining Association of Canada also joined in opposition.

A panel ruling in September allowed the Confederated Tribes to pursue claims that incorporate their unique cultural and spiritual ties to the Upper Columbia River, marking a significant expansion in how courts may interpret NRD liability under CERCLA.

3rd Circuit Weighs Judicial Oversight of Superfund Settlements

Meanwhile, the 3rd Circuit is assessing how much discretion courts should exercise in reviewing Superfund settlements, especially in light of recent Supreme Court decisions on agency deference. The case — USA v. Alden Leeds, et al. — involves a $150 million settlement approved by a New Jersey district court that allows a group of smaller potentially responsible parties (PRPs), known as the Small Parties Group (SPG), to avoid future liability for cleanup costs at the highly contaminated Diamond Alkali site.

Occidental Chemical Corp. (OxyChem), the largest PRP, is challenging the settlement, arguing that recent decisions — particularly the 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ruling that overturned Chevron deference — mean courts must more closely scrutinize EPA settlements.

SPG, in a brief filed Oct. 27, counters that the Loper decision applies only to legal interpretations by agencies, not to the courts’ oversight of negotiated settlements. They further cite the 2025 NEPA ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, which reaffirmed substantial deference to EPA’s discretionary settlement authority.

SPG also disputes arguments from Nokia of America, which was excluded from the settlement, asserting that its claims are premature. The case raises important questions about how EPA balances fairness and efficiency in securing cleanup funding from a wide array of responsible parties.

Summary of Emerging Legal and Policy Themes:

PFAS Hazard Designations: The D.C. Circuit will determine whether EPA’s use of CERCLA §102 to designate PFAS as hazardous substances can withstand industry challenges.

Cultural NRD Claims: The 9th Circuit may redefine the scope of CERCLA liability by deciding whether cultural resource damages are recoverable, even across international borders.

Judicial Deference to Settlements: The 3rd Circuit’s review of the Diamond Alkali settlement may set precedent for how courts evaluate complex Superfund cost allocations following major Supreme Court rulings.

These cases reflect growing tensions between environmental protection, regulatory authority, international comity, and the limits of judicial deference—issues likely to shape CERCLA’s future application across multiple dimensions.

Takeaway

These cases are poised to redefine the contours of Superfund liability. The outcomes will not only influence how emerging contaminants like PFAS are regulated, but also challenge the boundaries of judicial deference and international environmental accountability. Together, they signal a critical inflection point in the evolution of CERCLA—where scientific uncertainty, legal interpretation, and cross-border implications converge to reshape environmental governance in the United States.",https://www.mcglinchey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Washington-Changes-Green-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 00:58:15.177821

Washington, D.C. – Today, Ranking Member Huffman pushed back against Republicans’ so-called SPEED Act, a sweeping bill that would gut core provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and rig the rules to fast-track polluter projects and silence Americans. Democratic members offered a series of amendments to the legislation that would lower costs, improve public health, support community input, prevent polluter handouts, and stop Trump’s attacks on cheap, clean energy sources.

Excerpts and Highlights from Ranking Member Huffman’s Opening Remarks

“American families are struggling right now to make ends meet. Trump's tariffs have raised prices on everything. Millions of Americans are about to lose affordable health care because Republicans don't have a plan to fix the crisis that they set in motion. The last thing our constituents need right now is higher utility bills because President Trump wants to stop new transmission lines and shut down an entire sector of clean energy that can help us deliver cheap, affordable electricity.”

""While the House was out of session this fall, Democrats met with companies and organizations across the spectrum to discuss this legislation. [And] across these conversations, there was agreement that NEPA provides important benefits: benefits that force the federal government to take a hard look and carefully consider alternatives and impacts, benefits that provide transparency, benefits that provide community input and engagement. These are important pillars of NEPA that, unfortunately, are undermined in deeply disturbing ways by the legislation before us today.""

“[T]he SPEED Act [treats] environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes. Weakening environmental review won't fix permitting challenges. It certainly won't help us build the clean energy future that we need. Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

War on Clean Energy

“Wind and solar projects across this country are being shut down by this administration with the approval of Congressional Republicans. We can't ignore that. It is an essential part of the context for any serious conversation in this space. Now, if President Trump and Secretary Burgum weren't illegally blocking wind and solar projects right now, firing permitting staff, cutting funding for agencies – we'd be having a very different conversation about permitting legislation.”

""Donald Trump is not always right, as you have watched him be terribly wrong on the Epstein files, as you've watched him be terribly wrong on redistricting and this race to the bottom that he set in motion. He's not always right. And so, I'm going to urge my colleagues across the aisle to summon your independence, summon a little bit of courage once again this week, and push back on this president when he is terribly wrong – and he is terribly wrong on clean energy right now.”

“This bill is so extreme that there's simply nothing left in a meaningful way of NEPA if this were to become law. Now, Democrats are very interested in working constructively in problem solving. We would love to have a meaningful conversation, but it has to start with ending the war on clean energy, which this bill does not do in any significant way.”

“The promise of American leadership in the green economy is being squandered. In effect, as China dominates the industries and jobs of tomorrow, we're locking ourselves into a fossil fuel stalemate when we should be taking advantage of the clean energy revolution. I will continue to say this: we can't have a real conversation about permitting reform until these attacks stop.”

“Over the past few months, the Department of Energy has terminated $7.6 billion in clean energy awards. Reports show that nearly $23 billion more is on the chopping block right now. Projects that would lower energy costs, strengthen the grid, and provide thousands of jobs. These are straightforward, beneficial investments that serve only to benefit the average American, and there is no rational explanation for targeting them. The only people benefiting are Big Oil billionaires.”

Public Health and Community Input

“This bill would prevent agencies from examining harms that communities across the country are living with right now. So, consider the poster child here: Louisiana's Cancer Alley, where predominantly black neighborhoods face some of the highest pollution related cancer risks in the nation. Those risks result from cumulative emissions from many facilities over decades, impacts that are well documented and directly tied to federal permitting decisions. And under this bill, agencies would be prohibited from considering those cumulative effects because they unfold over time and across multiple sources. That's not streamlining. That's telling federal agencies to look the other way in the face of an obviously foreseeable harm.

""Agencies would be limited to analyzing only the alternatives that meet the applicant's preferred outcomes, and reasonable alternatives that would reduce environmental harm, lower costs, avoid impacts to communities, or better serve the public's interest, are excluded entirely by law. That is not reform. That is enabling biased analysis from the start. That is a thumb on the scale against the public.""

""This is an extreme and radical bill. [It’s] just chock full of these things that create an impossible gauntlet for people who are really hurt by bad projects and even illegal projects, from having any chance to challenge them. That is not an honest process. That is not a fine-tuning of NEPA. It's a dramatic, radical change to a law that protects the public.”

“[The] problem is the way the bill goes way too far in constraining environmental reviews, in eliminating, in some cases, transparency and public input. And we don't have to wonder what it looks like when you take away transparency, when you take away public input, when you make it impossible to stop a wrongheaded project that the federal government just decides to do, even if it's illegal, even if it's a crazy idea, when you make it impossible to scrutinize or stop that. We have a perfect example, and it is the East Wing of the White House right here. This is what happens when there's no transparency, when there's no scrutiny, when there's no input, when there's no way to stop a dumb idea from moving forward because you've done something like this to the NEPA process.”

Key Democratic Amendments

Huffman amendment #3 to prevent the bill from taking effect until clean energy grants such as offshore wind port grants that have been improperly rescinded by the Trump administration are reinstated and regulations are in place to prevent similar actions in the future.

Magaziner amendment #6 to clarify that renewable projects are recognized as legitimate multiple-use activities, planned responsibly, reviewed transparently, and coordinated with Tribes, states, fishermen, and local communities.

Ansari amendment #9 to amend the bill’s restrictions on the consideration of new science during much of the environmental review period. This amendment protects communities that would otherwise be put in harm’s way because an agency was forced to ignore new science about flooding, wildfire, pollution, or habitat collapse.

Rivas amendment #11 to ensure that NEPA’s public participation process is accessible and meets the needs of the community so people can have a voice in the decisions that affect their health, safety, and environment.

Rivas amendment #12 to add renewable energy to the list of national policies for the White House Council on Environmental Quality to foster and support.

Huffman amendment #13 to strike the provisions of the bill that dramatically narrows the definition of a “major Federal action” to exempt numerous projects from NEPA review and allow federal agencies to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on major infrastructure, energy, and environmental projects with no environmental review, no public input, and no accountability.

Grijalva amendment #14 to ensure that climate and environmental justice are included as national priorities pursued by the White House Council on Environmental Quality.

Min amendment #17 to repeal the Department of the Interior’s memo forcing all wind and solar energy projects through a permitting process that requires personal approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum at every stage of the permitting process, needlessly adding red tape to stall clean, affordable energy development.

Randall amendment #20 to exempt tribes from the bill’s restrictions that prevent them from getting judicial review, protecting their ability to challenge agency decisions that affect their lands, waters, cultural resources, and treaty obligations.

Randall amendment #22 to ensures that offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated by President Trump’s Big Ugly Bill still go through NEPA review.

Brownley amendment #24 to preserve meaningful accountability and ensure agencies correct significant errors before projects move forward.

Huffman amendment #26 to strike the provision that would prohibit agencies from considering cumulative effects of projects and foreseeable harm like pollution-related cancer risks.

Huffman amendment #28 to amend the judicial review section of the bill to ensure that federal agencies follow the law, listen to communities, and carefully consider the environmental and public-health consequences of their decisions.

Income-based Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) were established through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to make health insurance more affordable for qualifying Americans purchasing coverage through the Marketplaces. However, the APTCs now include several features that were temporarily enhanced under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and extended under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) through Dec. 31, 2025.

The APTCs under permanent law state that eligibility for premium assistance is limited to households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), among other requirements. APTCs are calculated as the difference between the premium of a benchmark health plan and an established maximum percentage of income that a household must contribute toward that plan. Under the APTCs established by the ACA, this required contribution amount increases on a sliding scale up to the 400% FPL income cap.

However, the temporarily “enhanced” credits (eAPTCs) eliminate the previous eligibility limit of 400% of FPL, allowing households earning above 400% of FPL to qualify for subsidies and leaving only the minimum income threshold of 100% of FPL in place. This temporarily removes the “subsidy cliff.” The eAPTCs also reduce the required contribution amount across all income levels. For example, households at 250% of FPL would normally be required to contribute 7.73% of the baseline premium under the permanent APTC calculation, but under the eAPTC calculation, these households are required to pay only 4% of the baseline premium, which nearly doubles the amount of premium assistance available. Under the eAPTC calculation, the maximum a household must pay is 8.5% of income toward a benchmark premium. If a household has an income high enough that 8.5% of income exceeds the benchmark premium, that household does not qualify for a subsidy.

Health insurance enrollment through the ACA Marketplaces reached 24.3 million for plan year 2025, more than double the 11.4 million who were enrolled in 2020. Notably, around 22.4 million enrollees (92%) received eAPTCs in 2025. Expiration of the eAPTCs would especially affect most individuals enrolled in marketplace health insurance plans, including beneficiaries with incomes above 400% of FPL, who would no longer be eligible. Households would also see their premiums rise sharply, leading to higher uninsured rates. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the uninsured population would increase by 2.2 million in 2026 alone without an extension.

The Debate Over eAPTCs

The fate of the eAPTCs became a central flashpoint during the record-breaking government shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12. Republicans refused to address the subsidies until the government reopened, arguing that it should be discussed separately from government funding. In contrast, Democrats said they would refuse to support legislation to reopen the government until the subsidies were addressed, highlighting that allowing them to expire will lead to substantial price increases for millions of Marketplace enrollees.

After more than six weeks of stalled negotiations, eight Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to help pass a government funding package through Jan. 30, and the House quickly followed suit. However, the deal did not include an extension of the expiring eAPTCs. Instead, Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote by mid-December on whether to extend them. There is no guarantee of passage, and House Republican leaders have not committed to bringing the measure up for a vote in their chamber. This leaves the future of eAPTCs unresolved, with open enrollment already in full swing and a Dec. 31 deadline fast approaching.

Extension of eAPTCs

Some moderate Republicans have acknowledged the importance of extending the eAPTCs. In October, 13 House Republicans sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) urging him to immediately focus on extending the eAPTCs after the government shutdown ends. The letter was led by Reps. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) and Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), reminding the speaker that millions of Americans will face skyrocketing health insurance premiums if the eAPTCs expire at the end of the year. They called on Speaker Johnson to help chart a conservative path forward on the eAPTCs, underscoring that allowing the credits to lapse without a path forward would risk real harm to their constituents. The letter does, however, call for reforms to make the credits more fiscally responsible.

Separately, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), who leads the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, has been vocal in pushing leadership to craft a bipartisan solution that is designed to pass both chambers and become law. He also led the introduction of the Premium Tax Credit Extension Act, alongside Rep. Kiggans, Problem Solvers Caucus Cochair Tom Suozzi (D-NY) and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, which would extend the enhanced subsidies through 2026 and maintain expanded eligibility for families earning above 400% of FPL.

Proposed Changes to eAPTCs

Outside of simply letting the eAPTCs expire or granting a straight extension, several notable Republicans have floated lists of possible ways to modify the eAPTCs without eliminating them entirely when they expire. Other proposed changes are likely to emerge as negotiations become more public. Some rank-and-file Democrats have been open to the idea of placing restrictions on the eAPTCs, but it is not clear whether they would be willing to accept a total phase-down of the subsidies.

Reps. Don Bacon (R-NE), Jeff Hurd (R-CO), Suozzi and Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) released a “statement of principles” outlining a potential bipartisan path forward on extending the eAPTCs. The plan includes the following ideas for extending and reforming the subsidies:

Temporary Extension: A two-year extension of the eAPTCs.

Income Cap: An income cap phased out between $200,000 and $400,000.

Reform: Guardrails to prevent improper payments of eAPTCs.

Prevent “Ghost Beneficiaries”: Requirements that ACA Marketplaces confirm recipient eligibility with the Death Master File.

Crack Down on Fraud: Establish a “preponderance of evidence” standard of proof to determine when an agent or broker should be allowed to continue operating in the ACA Marketplaces.

Enhance Delivery Clarity: Requirements that Marketplaces better notify recipients of the value of eAPTCs they are receiving from the federal government.

New Income Limits

One of the Republicans’ main concerns is that the eAPTC calculation removed the cap on credits going to individuals making above four times the FPL. Key Republicans, including Reps. Kiggans and Fitzpatrick have indicated an openness to imposing new income caps. Furthermore, several members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus have floated a $200,000 income cap. Key Democratic leaders have not outright rejected the proposal and have acknowledged that most beneficiaries already earn less than $200,000. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) has signaled she would be open to potential income caps, suggesting the idea is gaining bipartisan support.

Minimum Out-of-Pocket Premiums

Another idea floated by Republicans is mandating a minimum out-of-pocket payment to unlock eligibility for the eAPTCs. Certain Republicans have alleged that millions of ACA enrollees may not even know they are enrolled in certain plans because the premiums are fully subsidized. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) has highlighted that the minimum out-of-pocket premium could be very small, citing something like $5, to make people stop and think about what they are signing up for. This policy idea could help target “phantom” ACA enrollees, a concern that House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) said would need to be addressed in any extension.

Cutting Off eAPTCs for New Enrollees and Implementing Fraud Prevention

Some Republicans are calling for allowing current eAPTC enrollees continued access but cutting off access to the enhanced tax credits for new enrollees. The creation of a “grandfathering” clause would likely be accompanied by initiatives to root out waste, fraud and abuse in such health care plans.

New Abortion Restrictions

Some conservative activists argue that the tax credits indirectly subsidize plans to cover abortion. Republican lawmakers have echoed these concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has made clear that Republicans will insist on stronger Hyde Amendment protections, which prohibit federal funding for abortion. He is joined by Sens. Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mike Rounds (R-SD), who warned Democrats, “you won’t get any Republican votes” without tighter restrictions.

Democrats, however, remain firmly opposed to such restrictions. Sen. Shaheen called the proposal a “nonstarter,” emphasizing that the ACA already includes guardrails to comply with the Hyde Amendment. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and other Democratic leaders have similarly rejected reopening the abortion debate. This standoff could present a major hurdle to reaching a bipartisan agreement, as Republicans view abortion restrictions as essential while Democrats insist the issue was settled when the ACA was enacted.

Alternatives to eAPTCs

Some Republicans, including President Donald Trump and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy (R-LA), have proposed redirecting federal subsidy dollars from insurers to individuals through pre-funded Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs). Instead of receiving the eAPTCs that lower monthly premiums, eligible exchange enrollees would receive cash-like deposits into an account that could be used for qualified health expenses such as deductibles, co-pays, prescriptions, dental and vision services or out-of-network care. The plan has also been promoted by prominent conservative think tanks, including Paragon Health Institute.

Considering this activity, the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the eAPTCs, held a hearing on Nov. 19 to examine rising health care costs, the pending expiration of the eAPTCs and potential reforms or alternatives. Much of the discussion centered on alternative approaches rather than adjustments to the credits themselves. Republicans argued that temporary subsidies mask structural problems and promoted HSA-based and other models, while Democrats called for an immediate extension of the eAPTCs to prevent sharp premium increases for millions of enrollees.

During the hearing, Sen. Cassidy raised his HSA-based proposal again, framing it as a consumer-driven alternative that would redirect federal dollars from insurers to patient accounts to cover out-of-pocket costs. However, Democrats, like Sen. Shaheen, have stressed that the proposal would do little to help consumers facing sharply higher premiums in 2026, since HSA funds cannot be used to pay premiums and most ACA enrollees are not in bronze plans that qualify for HSAs. As a result, they argue that this approach would not offset the large premium increases expected when the eAPTCs expire.

On the House side, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee are beginning to circulate legislation that aligns with President Trump’s recent calls to redirect federal subsidy dollars away from insurers and directly to ACA enrollees. The Affordable Care and Comprehensive Economic Support through Savings (ACCESS) Act, led by Reps. Kat Cammack (R-FL) and Greg Steube (R-FL), would allow individuals to elect to receive part of their cost-sharing assistance as contributions to an HSA rather than through insurer-applied reductions in out-of-pocket costs.

Supporters argue this approach gives consumers greater control over their health spending and shifts power away from insurers. Additionally, some Republicans suggest it could lower premiums and federal deficits and allow lower-income enrollees to access more money for their health expenses. Critics, however, caution that redirecting subsidies could reduce ACA Marketplace enrollment by making comprehensive coverage less attractive, especially for younger and healthier individuals who may instead choose cheaper, less comprehensive plans or remain uninsured. While proponents view HSAs as a patient-centered alternative that increases flexibility, opponents see the option as a potential step toward weakening the ACA subsidy structure rather than a substitute for extending eAPTCs.

President Trump has started to contemplate this potential alternative to eAPTCs as part of his broader push towards health care affordability, as he says he wants a health care system where “we pay the money to people instead of the insurance companies.” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) is separately working on a bill related to HSAs alongside Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS), who has stated that Republicans will have a health care plan laid out by December that will lower costs. Ways and Means Committee staff are preparing presentations to walk members through the proposals, which signals that House Republicans may move ahead with Trump-aligned alternatives even as the Senate prepares for a December vote on extending the eAPTCs.

Regardless of the final approach, HSAs could be an attractive option for GOP members as they try to coalesce around a proposal in the next few weeks. Democrats largely see HSAs as a tactic to undermine the ACA and derail an extension of the tax credits.

On the Horizon

Open enrollment for ACA marketplace plans started on Nov. 1, and enrollees have received notices of planned premium increases. If Congress does not extend the eAPTCs before the end of the year, households will see a significant premium increase in their insurance plans. The Senate will have to hold a vote on the eAPTCs by mid-December, but there is no guarantee of action in the House. Over the next few weeks, lawmakers will need to coalesce around a strategy as they sort through dozens of potential options.

The new rule comes after the Supreme Court sided with a North Idaho couple who were told they would need to obtain a costly federal permit to build a new home on the shores of Priest Lake.
The court found that wetlands are protected by the Clean Water Act only if they have a “significant nexus” to regulated waters.
Environmental groups have argued the new rule would roll back decades of progress in reducing pollutants in the environment.
“The draft rule proposed Monday by the Trump Administration removes federal protections for many wetlands and streams, but it does not minimize these state protections,” Hart said.","The federal Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a new rule that would drastically reduce the number of wetlands protected by federal environmental regulations.

State officials in Idaho and Washington, meanwhile, say while they continue to review the potential impact of the rule if fully implemented, they remain committed to protecting their land from pollution.

The new rule comes after the Supreme Court sided with a North Idaho couple who were told they would need to obtain a costly federal permit to build a new home on the shores of Priest Lake. In its 2023 ruling, the court found the EPA had overstepped its regulatory authority over the “waters of the United States,” which are protected from pollution by the Clean Water Act of 1972.

The court found that wetlands are protected by the Clean Water Act only if they have a “significant nexus” to regulated waters.

The EPA says the new rule complies with this finding. If finalized, the rule would limit federal regulation to “relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water,” including streams, oceans, rivers, lakes, and wetlands that are “connected and indistinguishable” from such bodies of water.

“When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement Monday.

Zeldin added that Democrats have “weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families” for decades.

If approved, Zeldin said the rule would protect navigable waters from pollution while advancing “cooperative federalism by empowering states.”

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, if finalized, the change may strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85% of wetlands in the country.

Environmental groups have argued the new rule would roll back decades of progress in reducing pollutants in the environment.

Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance, said in a statement that the rule “continues to prioritize corporate interests by compromising the already weakened protections for thousands of water bodies across the country.”

Manufacturing groups, meanwhile, contend the rule would provide clarity on which waterways are protected.

“Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability,” said National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons in a statement.

However, it remains unclear what impact the change could have on state regulations.

Nick Schofield, a spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, said Wednesday that the agency is in the “preliminary stages of reviewing the proposal and assessing how it aligns” with the state’s existing programs and rules.

“At this point, it’s too early to determine what the potential implications may be for wetlands in the state or for state-managed lands,” Schofield said. “Once we have a clearer understanding of the proposal and its practical effects, we’ll be able to provide more information.”

Schofield added the agency takes “its mission to protect human health and the quality of Idaho’s air, land, and water very seriously and believes fully in our vision where the quality of our environment enhances healthy living and supports thriving communities.”

Curt Hart, a spokesperson for the Washington Department of Ecology, said Tuesday that state law has provided protections over wetlands and streams for decades, laws that would not be impacted by the new rule.

“The draft rule proposed Monday by the Trump Administration removes federal protections for many wetlands and streams, but it does not minimize these state protections,” Hart said.

While the agency continues to review the proposed rule and its potential impact, Hart said wetlands are protected by a collection of state laws, including the 1945 Water Pollution Control Act, the 1972 Shoreline Management Act and the 1990 Growth Management Act.

“Wetlands are critical for reducing flooding, recharging drinking water aquifers, protecting water quality, and providing habitat necessary for the survival of salmon, migratory birds and other species,” Hart said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/T9jTcLfj0ZcFbHK7-y38UAYLFO4=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/11/19/633b4dc6aa2db.hires.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 21:58:53.270288

Susie Lee says this one drought measure must survive federal spending purges: water recycling.
“The states that surround the Colorado River — they’re red and blue,” Lee said in a Thursday interview.
In addition to Pure Water, the Bureau of Reclamation has committed to funding other water recycling projects in California, and one in Utah.
The grant program is a big help in getting water recycling projects off the ground, Pellegrino said.
“Help build resiliency, help build new supplies, reduce the reliance on the Colorado River or whatever other system it is that might be strapped.","For Las Vegas to keep its taps flowing, Rep. Susie Lee says this one drought measure must survive federal spending purges: water recycling.

Lee, D-Nev., and Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., introduced the Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization Act in Congress on Thursday to reauthorize a federal grant program that will sunset in 2026. While it doesn’t currently add any more money to the program, Lee said it would allow the Bureau of Reclamation to dole out $125 million in unused funds, extending the program to 2031.

“The states that surround the Colorado River — they’re red and blue,” Lee said in a Thursday interview. “But it’s a crisis, and the reason this reauthorization is so important is to make sure we continue to have the authority to use the funding to support these programs.”

Previously, Congress folded Lee’s initial 2021 program proposal into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — a law creating a pool of funding that Republicans have tried to claw back. In 2024, a bill to nearly double the amount of funding for the program that Lee helped author stalled and did not get a hearing in committee.

To date, according to Lee’s office, the Bureau of Reclamation’s program has provided more than $125 million to Pure Water Southern California, a water recycling program in California that officials say will produce 150 million gallons of water per day that would have previously been dumped in the Pacific Ocean.

The Southern Nevada Water Authority’s board authorized the agency to give $750 million to the project in 2021. That will likely be in exchange for a transfer of water, where Nevada would be able to pull more water from Lake Mead, agency spokesman Bronson Mack said.

In addition to Pure Water, the Bureau of Reclamation has committed to funding other water recycling projects in California, and one in Utah.

Why recycle water?

Capturing, treating and sending wastewater back into Lake Mead is the single way that modern Las Vegas is able to use more than its small share of the Colorado River amid remarkable population growth.

A 2024 analysis of water recycling in the Colorado River Basin from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that Nevada outperforms on that metric, reusing about 85 percent of its wastewater.

Other states have yet to begin that journey, including Wyoming and Utah, which respectively only reuse about 3.3 and 1 percent of their wastewater, according to the study.

Colby Pellegrino, deputy general manager of resources at the water authority, said after a board meeting Thursday that water recycling projects, especially along the Colorado River Basin, are often costly and hard to pull off.

This year, a study backed that up: It can cost up to $2,000 of federal dollars per acre-foot (or about 326,000 gallons) of water saved when it comes to water recycling. That’s in contrast to far less expensive water savings from innovation in agriculture.

The grant program is a big help in getting water recycling projects off the ground, Pellegrino said.

“That was what it was aimed at: Let’s let the federal government have a way in to make a meaningful participation in these big projects,” she said. “Help build resiliency, help build new supplies, reduce the reliance on the Colorado River or whatever other system it is that might be strapped. I think that’s turned out to be a good investment.”

The 2023 Rule, which was authorized by the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), restricted the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in certain sectors. HFCs are potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) used in processes including refrigeration. Under the Proposed Rule, some refrigeration equipment would be exempt from the 2023 Rule’s restrictions, and some restrictions would be delayed. Our comments identify three legal flaws in the Proposed Rule:

EPA unlawfully favors deregulation over regulation by proposing to make the final rule effective 30 days after publication, in contravention of statutory requirements. The AIM Act requires one year between publication and the effective date of any rule promulgated under the statutory authority EPA invokes here. That timing requirement is plain in the statutory text, reflects the common understanding that a deregulation is still a “rule,” coheres with the statutory scheme, and is supported by legislative history. EPA’s contention that regulatory “relief,” such as the Proposed Rule, falls outside the AIM Act’s effective-date requirement is untenable.

EPA violates the AIM Act by failing to consider the “overall economic costs and environmental impacts” of the Proposed Rule using the “best available data.” When EPA promulgated the 2023 Rule, it anticipated substantial economic and environmental benefits. Now that EPA seeks to weaken the 2023 Rule, it almost entirely neglects the likely costs of the proposed rollback. Moreover, EPA declines to use its own previous estimate of the social cost of greenhouse gases, which represent the best available data. Finally, EPA fails to consider the potential reliance interests of some regulated entities in preserving the 2023 Rule.

The Proposed Rule is arbitrary and capricious. Much the same analytical flaws that render the Proposed Rule unlawful under the AIM Act also render it inadequately reasoned under bedrock administrative law.",https://policyintegrity.org/assets/img/thumbnail.png,N,,2025-11-20 23:00:10.290310

There are currently 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects awaiting state approval, according to the Department of Conservation and Energy.
“Eminent domain is designed for the public good … This is not for the public benefit,” Fleming said.
Some GOP state lawmakers with projects proposed in their districts have called for more restrictions on carbon capture and local approval for such projects.
“We don’t think the whole state really realizes what’s happening.” Opponents of carbon capture and CO2 transport have concerns over safety and environmental impacts.","A group of Louisiana residents is suing Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration over state laws that allow the acquisition of private property against landowners’ wishes for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide.

Save My Louisiana, composed mostly of resident and elected officials from Allen, Beauregard, Livingston, Rapides and Vernon parishes, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state Thursday morning in the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge. Group president Gray Musgrove joined six other local citizens in the case against the governor and state Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.

The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. A Conservation and Energy spokesman declined to comment, citing department policy on pending litigation.

The lawsuit argues statutes on the use of eminent domain for carbon capture and storage in Louisiana law are unconstitutional. The laws “provide special privileges and immunities to private Corporations,” deny citizens their right to own property and cede judicial authority to the executive branch of state government.

There are currently 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects awaiting state approval, according to the Department of Conservation and Energy. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana.

Only one well, operated by Hackberry Carbon Sequestration in Cameron Parish, has received approval so far, with its permit okayed on Sept. 5. The 101 total storage wells from these projects would cover 18 different parishes, mostly centered in Central and South Louisiana.

Various state laws on the use of eminent domain for carbon transport and storage are listed in the lawsuit. Developers and government agencies that have successfully argued in court for the use of eminent domain to obtain property lean on the argument that the acquisition is for a greater good that outweighs the interests of the property owner. In the case of CO2 pipelines, the reasoning is that removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere and storing it underground is in the interest of public health by mitigating the effects of climate change.

Supporters of the plaintiffs disagree. They include Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, a U.S. Senate candidate who joined the plaintiffs outside the courthouse for a news conference and shared his opposition to forced land acquisitions for carbon capture projects.

“Eminent domain is designed for the public good … This is not for the public benefit,” Fleming said. “This is for the benefit of a very, very small group of people who will end up making lots of money from this.”

The issue of carbon capture has divided a Republican Party in Louisiana that typically backs the fossil fuel industry, a sector that’s shown the greatest interest in developing the technology. Some GOP state lawmakers with projects proposed in their districts have called for more restrictions on carbon capture and local approval for such projects. Gov. Jeff Landry has said he would like to see Louisiana lead the way in putting the technology to use.

“Believe me, we all support the oil and gas industry in general,” said Fleming, a Republican. “But there’s a segment that wants to make even additional money by putting burden on the citizens, and that’s where we draw the line. This is not good for Louisiana.”

Mike Slocum, co-founder of Save My Louisiana and one of the plaintiffs, said that while his group staunchly backs fossil fuels, there’s a lack of transparency between the industry and state and residents of parishes where carbon capture projects are planned.

“As we started to have [Save My Louisiana] meetings, we found that the community didn’t really know what it was,” Slocum said. “We don’t think the whole state really realizes what’s happening.”

Opponents of carbon capture and CO2 transport have concerns over safety and environmental impacts. Most hold up the example of a ruptured CO2 pipeline in 2020 that forced the evacuation of the small town of Satartia, Mississippi, that resulted in 45 people being hospitalized. Other worries include possible groundwater contamination and the potential for leaks.

Beauregard Parish resident Mona DeFries, who owns land in Calcasieu Parish near a planned CO2 pipeline, said she feels the use of eminent domain for carbon capture is “a slap in the face” for property owners like her. Although she’s not a party in the lawsuit and hasn’t yet lost land to a project, DeFries said she supports its objectives and is concerned over environmental impacts and risk factors.

We are so excited to have them on our team — congratulations Lori Peters, Dave Wildemann, and Nicole Chandler!

All three of these new leaders went through the Sierra Club training, which culminates in a qualifying hike at a location of the leader’s choosing.

Lori chose Fort Harrison State Park (known locally as Fort Ben) in Marion County for her outing

Lori is a Sierra Club member who started joining our hikes last year, and recently became a volunteer with the Hoosier Chapter. I was excited to get to join her on the hike! Our group of eight had a wonderful time checking out the fall colors and beautiful tall trees on the trail.

“I chose Ft. Ben for my hike because it’s a beautiful state park close to home with several trails of varying difficulty levels. The Fall Creek Trail and Camp Creek Trails connect to make the perfect 3 mile loop through hills and winding paths where I’ve seen all kinds of wildlife during hikes with my husband.”

“There’s a massive, beautiful sycamore tree close to the start of the hike where we took a group photo. It’s a real show stopper and I think everyone enjoyed seeing it. Learning from others while on the hike was another highlight. Laurie, Dave, and Marilyn pointed out wildflowers, invasive plants, and unique trees helping me put a name to things I’ve seen so many times but didn’t know what they were.” - Lori

Dave led his hike at Laura Hare Nature Preserve at Downey Hill in Brown County

Dave joined the Winding Waters Group Executive Committee earlier this year after discovering the Group through their annual native plant sale. Eleven folks ventured out on a beautiful fall day in Brown County for his qualifying hike.

“I chose a trail at one of my favorite nature preserves, Laura Hare Nature Preserve at Downey Hill. I was very familiar with the location, trail, and terrain. I was able to highlight features along the trail. We had a wonderful sunny day and near peak fall colors. I could not have asked for a better day.” - Dave

Nicole chose Green's Bluff Nature Preserve in Owen County for her outing

Nicole is the Southwest Indiana Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer. She decided to follow in the footsteps of fellow Sierra Club staff member Robyn Skuya-Boss (our Chapter Director) who became an Outings Leader last year!

“I chose Green's Bluff Nature Preserve because it holds a special place in my heart. I hiked this trail many times while in graduate school at IU. Highlights from the hike were the beautiful fall colors from the trees and taking a water break by Racoon Creek.” - Nicole

Congratulations to all of our new Outings Leaders on completing their certification!

Hearing the experiences of my fellow Hoosiers’ journey to become Outings Leaders, I can really feel the urge to get outside and connect with nature and our communities.

That’s why I’ve decided to join the next Outings Leadership training cohort this winter. Would you like to join me?

Here is what our new leaders said about the training:

“I felt the process to become an Outings Leader was fairly straightforward and enjoyable. I would encourage anyone who is interested and capable to become an Outings Leader. We spend less and less time outside, so any opportunity to do so is a positive!” - Nicole

“It was easy and straightforward to complete the online training. It was convenient and self-paced which helped avoid conflicts that a fixed schedule training program could have. My biggest challenge was devoting the time to complete the training. If you enjoy hiking, becoming an Outings Leader is an opportunity to share that passion with others. The Outings Leader training provides you with information to plan and lead hikes in a structured manner.” - Dave

“As a new member I really enjoyed the training modules. I learned so much, not only about how to become an Outings Leader, but the history of the Sierra Club as well. Being an Outings Leader is definitely outside of my comfort zone, but the people in the Sierra Club are so supportive and kind in nature that it made it a real treat to host them on a hike on my local trails. If you’re apprehensive, just know that there’s really nothing more to it than taking some friends on a walk in the woods. You can cover important topics and issues - or not! Come as you are. Be respectful, and take a chance to put yourself out there!” - Lori

I’ll give the last word to our Chapter Director, Robyn: “Outings Leaders distinguish Sierra Club as a community that prioritizes the critical connections spending time outdoors together can build. Connections which sustain us as we advocate to protect our environment at this challenging moment in history for our environment. Becoming a certified outing leader expands the number of critical connections we can make that keep our community resilient and strong.”

BYD’s presence is also being felt at the ongoing COP30 climate summit in Brazil’s Belem, where it is a cosponsor alongside GWM, another Chinese electric carmaker.

The sponsorship is just one of many ways that China’s investments in green technology are being felt at the UN’s top climate meeting, where the Chinese official delegation of 789 people is second only to Brazil’s 3,805.

It is a stark contrast to the United States, whose federal government has not sent an official delegation. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has accused US President Donald Trump of “handing the future to China” and leaving states like California to pick up the slack, in a speech at the summit.

“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said. Trump has called concerns over climate change a “hoax” and a “con job”.

But the UN Climate Change Conference COP30 is not the only event where the diverging paths that China and the US are taking on addressing the climate crisis are being felt.

Back in the US, and in neighbouring Canada, trade barriers aimed at punishing Chinese electric vehicles have made them far costlier than what the manufacturers want to sell them for.

These tariffs are a legacy of former US President Joe Biden’s administration, and place North America as an outlier at a time when Chinese EVs otherwise dominate the global market.

How dominant is China in EVs?

Joel Jaeger, a senior research associate with the World Resources Institute, told Al Jazeera that Chinese EVs have “really upended the car market” in recent years.

China has gone “from basically not a major player five years ago” to becoming “the number one exporter of cars globally in terms of the units”, says Jaeger.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China manufactured 12.4 million electric cars in 2024, more than 70 percent of the 17.3 million electric cars manufactured globally last year.

Of these, China exported about 1.25 million cars, representing 40 percent of global exports, while the remaining Chinese-made cars — the vast majority — were sold domestically.

This dominance has been built on the back of “subsidies that China’s put in place to develop its industry, which I think is a very strategic thing that China has done, both for its own economic growth as well as decarbonisation”, Jaeger said.

But on the streets of the US or Canada, Chinese EVs are still relatively rare.

Why are Chinese EVs less affordable in the US and Canada?

According to Jaeger, “prohibitive” tariffs mean that Chinese EVs are almost impossible to buy in the US and Canada.

“In the last year, the US and Canada both put on basically completely prohibitive tariffs on EVs [of] over 100 percent in both places,” he added.

Notably, the steep import taxes on Chinese EVs in the US were introduced under Biden, a Democrat, who championed renewable energy, in contrast to Trump, who has pledged to fight it and “drill, baby, drill” for oil.

A month after the US introduced 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs in September 2024, Canada brought in identical tariffs of its own.

It means that a car that a Chinese EV manufacturer might be selling at $30,000 actually costs at least $60,000 in the US or Canada. This makes it hard for even cheaper Chinese models to compete with the higher-end US electric models, which on average retail for approximately $55,000.

These tariffs, along with other US policies, have meant that Chinese manufacturers have yet to set up shop in the US.

In Canada, Addisu Lashitew, an associate professor of business at McMaster University, told Al Jazeera that the steep tariffs conflict with targets set to transition fully to electric cars by 2035, but are also complicated due to Canada’s close trading ties with the US.

“The problem is that one, we are going through a very complex trade talk with the US now,” said Lashitew. “And two, our supply chain has also [been] very much integrated. Many of the American manufacturers are here, and Canadian firms are mainly suppliers.”

But while it is almost impossible to buy a cheap Chinese electric car in the US, Jaeger says this does not mean that North America is completely missing out on importing new Chinese technology.

“The US, for example, imports a lot of batteries from China. It’s actually the second-biggest importer of lithium-ion batteries behind Germany in the world, from China. So, they’re using them in US-made EVs,” he said.

Where can you buy cheap Chinese electric cars?

In contrast with the US and Canada, said Jaeger, many other countries have been more open to China’s EV market.

“You see different reactions from different countries, depending on their relationship with China, but mostly depending upon their domestic auto manufacturing presence,” he said.

Lashitew told Al Jazeera that Chinese exporters, including BYD as well as some smaller firms, are “targeting many emerging and developing countries”.

“Ironically, we’re in a situation where in the transportation sector, the energy transition is happening much faster in the Global South than in North America, at least.”

Chinese electric cars have also continued to sell well in many European countries, says Jaeger, despite those countries also imposing some tariffs, though lower than the US and Canada, “for what they see as unfair competitive practices in China”.

Still, while BYD has built factories in Japan, Hungary and India, as well as Brazil, its biggest presence remains in China, where the company was founded in Shenzhen in 1995. A majority of the 4.27 million electric cars that BYD sold in 2024 were bought by Chinese consumers. BYD also has a manufacturing presence in Lancaster, California, where it builds electric buses and batteries, but not cars.

In China, the local market has grown in part due to incentives from the government, which also saw electric cars as part of its strategy to bring down air pollution in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.

Customers in China have benefitted from the government’s approach, including through access to new technology. For example, a new battery, which BYD announced in March with the promise of charging for 400km (about 250 miles) of travel in just five minutes, is first being made available for preorder to customers in China only.

How expensive are EVs?

They used to be costlier than cars that run on petrol or diesel. But according to the IEA, the cost of owning an electric car over the vehicle’s entire lifetime is now less than fossil fuel-powered cars, due to the reduced costs of fuel and maintenance.

Buying an electric car is still often more expensive, though.

That is where China’s subsidies to manufacturers help. The IEA has found that prices for electric cars in China are similar to petrol and diesel cars, with half of all electric cars being sold for less than $30,000 and a wide range of lower-priced models available.

By contrast, in the US and Europe, “the range [of available EVs] was skewed towards higher-end models with higher prices”, according to the IEA.

Under Biden, the US tried to boost its domestic electric vehicle industry, while also trying to get the sector to reduce dependence on China.

Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced incentives for US manufacturers that did not use any Chinese parts. The IRA also introduced subsidies for consumers who bought EVs, though these have largely been overturned by Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which became law in July.

Nevertheless, even with the Biden-era incentives, only one in 10 cars sold in the US in 2024 was electric, while more than half of all new cars sold last year in China were electric.

Not just cars

While electric cars grab most headlines on sustainable transport, people are also increasingly turning to electric bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, buses and even trains in many parts of the world.

Even in the US, says Jaeger, there has been a significant growth in the number of electric scooters and two-wheelers imported from China.

According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), the US imported $1.5bn worth of electric two-wheelers from China in the 12 months up to September 2025, an increase of $275m — or more than 20 percent — from the previous year. Experts say that is because scooters are cheaper than cars, and because US tariffs on Chinese electric scooters are also lower than on electric cars.

Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the government has said it will ban petrol-powered motorbikes in the centre of its capital, Hanoi, from July next year, as part of a plan to tackle local air pollution.

According to the IEA, some 40 percent of bus sales are now electric in European countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway.

There have also been increases in electric bus sales in Central and South America. In Mexico, for example, “close to 18 percent of all bus sales were electric in 2024, up from just above 1 percent in 2023”, according to the IEA.

Still, the US continues to struggle here, too. Electric bus sales declined in 2024, according to the IEA, after the leading electric bus manufacturer went bankrupt and a second company stopped manufacturing in the US market after suffering sustained financial losses.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_691d86ed82e35-1763542765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-20 19:02:10.114409

Also gone is the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has played a major role in promoting technologies like solar power.
“The Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore common sense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” Chris Wright, the energy secretary, said in a statement announcing the reorganization.
The Trump administration has already frozen or canceled large amounts of Biden-era clean energy funding.
Over the past year, the Energy Department has lost roughly 20 percent of its work force — or 3,500 employees — amid a wave of firings, layoffs and incentives for retirement.","The Energy Department is breaking up or rebranding several offices that played key roles in the Biden administration’s push to develop clean energy technologies that could help address climate change.

A revised organizational chart posted by the agency on Tuesday no longer shows the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, or the Grid Deployment Office. Those offices had overseen billions of dollars in funding for batteries, hydrogen fuels and electrical grids, among other projects.

Also gone is the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has played a major role in promoting technologies like solar power. That office has been rebranded as the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation.

It is not yet clear how much of the work in these offices may be preserved or transferred elsewhere. But the overhaul reflects the priorities of the Trump administration, which has sought to dismantle Biden-era efforts to tackle global warming and encourage renewable energy and has instead focused on expanding fossil fuel production and prioritizing technologies like nuclear power.

“The Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore common sense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” Chris Wright, the energy secretary, said in a statement announcing the reorganization.

The Trump administration has already frozen or canceled large amounts of Biden-era clean energy funding. In May, the Energy Department announced it was terminating $3.7 billion in awards to companies trying to demonstrate technologies that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That included natural gas and cement companies trying to capture and bury the carbon dioxide put out by their smokestacks.

In October, Mr. Wright announced he was canceling an additional $7.5 billion for hundreds of energy projects, mostly in states run by Democrats. That included funding for large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels as well as efforts to upgrade electrical grids and reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations.

An internal document has also been circulating among lawmakers suggesting that the agency is considering terminating $12 billion more, including funding for two large projects in Louisiana and Texas that aimed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Mr. Wright has said that he does not consider climate change one of the nation’s most pressing problems, as the Biden administration did. Instead, he has said he wants to prioritize energy sources that can run around the clock and help power data centers for artificial intelligence. That includes technologies like coal, natural gas, nuclear power and geothermal energy, as well as nascent fusion technology.

The reorganization reflects that shift.

For the first time in decades, the agency will no longer have an Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which was established in its current form in the 1990s and had overseen efforts to increase the energy efficiency of appliances and drive down the cost of solar panels.

The office will instead be renamed the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, which is expected to absorb some of the functions of the now-disbanded clean energy offices, according to two people familiar with the plans who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The reorganization also eliminates the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which was established by Congress as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law in 2021 and focused on scaling up emerging technologies, such as advanced nuclear reactors or hydrogen fuels. That office had already lost the vast majority of its staff under the Trump administration.

Other Biden-era offices that were disbanded include: the Grid Deployment Office, which worked on upgrading the nation’s network of power lines; the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which had been working to establish a domestic battery industry; and the Office of State and Community Energy Programs, which helped support state efforts to improve energy efficiency.

The Trump administration is creating several new offices instead, including the Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office as well as the Office of Fusion.

The agency’s high-profile Loan Programs Office, which provides billions of dollars in loans for promising technologies, will be renamed the Office of Energy Dominance Financing. Mr. Wright has said he mainly wants that office to bankroll new nuclear plants.

It is unclear whether the reorganization will lead to additional layoffs. Over the past year, the Energy Department has lost roughly 20 percent of its work force — or 3,500 employees — amid a wave of firings, layoffs and incentives for retirement.

As part of a deal to end the government shutdown this month, congressional Democrats secured a provision that barred further work force reductions at federal agencies until Jan. 30.

Kathleen Hogan, a former senior agency official who had served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, warned that reorganizations can be disruptive.

“Given the recent talent drain and other challenges, let’s hope for the sake of U.S. energy security, competitiveness and business certainty that this is a positive,” Ms. Hogan said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/20/multimedia/20cli-energy-cwjb/20cli-energy-cwjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:01:37.431341

The groups are represented by Troposphere Legal and Earthjustice.

In the filing, the groups assert that DTE has failed to support numerous claims related to purported costs and benefits of the data center project, including assurances that the massive influx in energy demand related to the data center would not increase costs to ratepayers. DTE has also failed to detail its plans to comply with Michigan’s nation-leading renewable energy standards and energy efficiency standards. In addition, DTE has redacted significant portions of the proposed contracts with the data center, thereby hiding such information from public review.

The MPSC earlier this week announced plans to hold a public comment forum on DTE's ex parte application, responding to public pressure to provide more transparency. This rushed forum – planned just two days before a previously planned MPSC meeting where DTE is reportedly pushing for a final decision – does not provide the proper forum for review on a project that would massively impact our energy grid.

“DTE and the MPSC cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence,” said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan Campaign Organizer for the Sierra Club. “If the company believes these contracts won’t raise bills or accelerate fossil dependence, it should welcome a contested case where its claims can be tested. Asking Michiganders to rely on informal assurances made on behalf of massive tech corporations as data centers across the country destabilize grids, derail climate plans, and drive up costs is indefensible.”

A contested case hearing is needed in order for Sierra Club and other groups to effectively conduct discovery, evaluate DTE’s application, and advocate for Michiganders who will be directly impacted by this project.

Additional statements from Sierra Club, NRDC, and CUB:

""DTE is asking the Commission to approve one of the largest energy deals in our state without providing the evidence needed to show it will not raise bills or shift major risks onto Michigan families. A project of this scale deserves a full and open review,” said Derrell Slaughter, Michigan Policy Director for Climate and Energy at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “A contested case gives the public and independent experts the chance to verify the costs, assess the clean energy needs, and make sure the commitments being made add up. While economic growth is good, we owe it to Michiganders to get the details right and protect ratepayers every step of the way.”

“Transparency is not optional. Under Michigan law, the MPSC cannot approve utility requests that will result in increased costs for ratepayers without giving other interested parties an opportunity to fully participate in the proceeding,” said Elena Saxonhouse, a managing attorney with the Sierra Club's Environmental Law Program. “The MPSC risks setting a dangerous precedent allowing a rushed approval process for a data center proposal of this magnitude. With so many data center proposals on the way, and so many questions about how each project will impact already high utility bills for Michiganders, the MPSC cannot allow utilities to rush through contract approvals without scrutiny.”

""Too much is at stake in this data center case for it not to be fully contested,"" said Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan. ""DTE customers already pay some of the highest residential rates in the country, and this contract needs to be fully vetted to ensure it doesn't exacerbate the affordability problem.""",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-20 19:01:55.254895

BACKGROUND

Biotechnology will shape how the U.S. defends itself, secures its food supply, and cures life-threatening diseases. NSCEB warned that without rapid and significant investment, the U.S. will fall behind its global competitors, specifically China.

The Biomanufacturing Excellence Act would additionally establish a public-private center dedicated to advancing biopharmaceutical manufacturing – a key recommendation from the NSCEB report.

Specifically, the National Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Center of Excellence would:

Unite industry professionals with academic researchers to conduct collaborative research on new technology for scaling biopharmaceutical manufacturing

Host a facility that replicates industrial manufacturing conditions and complies with Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations, where innovators would develop and test new manufacturing processes

Identify challenges and opportunities for scaling biopharmaceutical manufacturing, especially for products important to U.S. national security, public health, and economic security

Train tomorrow’s biopharmaceutical manufacturing workforce by partnering with educational, industry, and community leaders to bolster biotechnology talent

“Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.” Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development.
More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act.","The Environmental Protection Agency wants to take away federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands in Louisiana and the rest of the country, allowing them to be polluted or developed without the need for permits under a new set of proposed regulations the agency unveiled Monday.

The EPA’s long-awaited proposed rules would change what counts as federally protected waters in the United States. They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded.

The draft regulations cover what are called the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS. They include new definitions for what counts as a wetland that falls under the protection of the Clean Water Act.

In short, the proposed updates require wetlands to touch permanent bodies of water — such as lakes, rivers or streams — and have visible surface water for at least part of the year in order for federal safeguards to apply.

Most at risk in Louisiana are the non-coastal, inland swamps that make up about 59% of the state’s wetlands area, according to an analysis from the Environmental Law Institute.

Environmental advocates argue the rules would put important ecosystems, flood control measures and pollution management at risk, while legal experts worry the definitions will only add more confusion to an already complex topic.

The public will have 45 days to submit a comment on the proposed WOTUS rules once they are officially published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The EPA will then consider whether any comment warrants revisions in the proposed regulations, which would be incorporated into the final version. The Trump administration has not laid out a timeline for putting the new rules into effect.

“I think it’s a big alarm for pretty much wherever you are, that federal oversight over wetlands is drastically limited, and there is not a backup plan to deal with this,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy.

“It’s going to create a lot of … problems for states and local communities going forward who have relied on federal oversight and the mitigation for wetlands and development,” she added. “There will be confusion.”

The removal of certain federal wetlands protections follows the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA, which pared back federal authority to enforce the Clean Water Act. An Idaho couple successfully challenged the agency when it stopped them from developing their property, with justices interpreting the definition of Waters of the United States to mean “’only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing.”

The proposed rule raises questions in Louisiana as to whether future construction could disqualify even more wetlands from Clean Water Act protection, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a Louisiana-based environmental advocacy group.

Central to whether or not a wetland is protected is whether or not it touches a lake, river or bayou on which a boat can navigate.

“In Louisiana, that can get a little squishy,” Rota said.

The Louisiana Legislature passed a law earlier this year that defines wetlands separated from surface water connections by manmade levees as “fastlands,” excluding them from state protections. With the newly proposed federal WOTUS definitions following the same deregulatory lines as Louisiana, certain wetlands here would no longer have any safeguards against development, advocates say.

Plus, Louisiana now allows future construction of levees and berms to disqualify wetlands from state protection. Even if an area has coverage under the law today, it could lose it if a levee is built around it in the future, Rota said.

State Sen.“Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, who authored the legislation, said this is an area in which revisions to the proposed WOTUS rule are necessary.

“In public comment, they can go through all of those and get some good answers for stuff like that,” said Fesi. “I don’t want to go fill up a swamp that’s full of cypress trees.”

Fesi added that he is “excited” about the proposed rules and believes current building codes are adequate to address concerns over building in flood-prone areas.

“I think there’s been a lot of rules put in place that protects against some of the problems” with flooding, he said. “Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.”

Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development. For example, any area that touches the navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico falls under the Clean Water Act, and the state’s coastal zone construction restrictions protect other areas.

More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act. These areas would need to meet the federal definition of having surface water at least during the wet season as well as continually touch a waterway like a lake, river, stream or bayou.

“Hopefully this will not have a huge impact on coastal restoration activities and protecting our coastal wetlands,” Rota said. “But our coastal wetlands are only as healthy as our internal wetlands and internal waterways that are feeding them.”

“Whenever you remove some of these more upland wetlands or ephemeral streams that supply either fresh water, nutrients … it could still have an impact,” he added.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/11/5.-Elise-Plunk-IMG_9859-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 18:02:22.124815

Research firm IDTechEx’s latest study “Li-ion Battery Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Applications, Outlooks and Forecasts” indicates that global annual battery production capacity will reach 5.4 TWh in the next decade, rising from 500 GWh reported in 2020.

According to the report, more than 50% of that capacity will be centralized in China. As of 2024, China controlled more than 75% of total global battery production capacity, due to fast development of gigafactories and subsidization by governmental bodies.

Major players in terms of lithium-ion cell suppliers include CATL, BYD and Gotion in China; LG Chem and Samsung SDI in Korea; Panasonic in Japan and more, with Panasonic and LG Chem generally focusing on the North American and European markets. The top six players account for more than 65% of the global total sales in 2025, and CATL alone accounted for 37% of global lithium-ion battery sales in 2024, according to IDTechEx.

In 2025, the global production capacity of lithium-Ion batteries was more than 2,500 GWh. However, development of a gigafactory is a multi-year project, requiring significant investment – in the order of $50-$100 million USD per GWh. Plans and timelines are often subject to delays and cancellations, especially outside of China, where generally slower growth in electric vehicles and energy storage system markets have led to less demand than initially forecast, resulting in more limited funds for gigafactory development.

Tensions with China have also led to delays and cancellations in gigafactory plans, especially in the United States. IDTechEx has tracked gigafactory development across the world, and notes several delays and cancellations related to geopolitical tensions.

Examples include LG’s Lansing facility, which was initially meant to be a joint venture with GM Motors that would start production in 2025. As the venture with GM fell through, LG is now looking for other partners to develop the facility. Gotion has also experienced difficulties in expanding a gigafactory in Michigan, due to conflict with locals. While the facility was initially green-lighted by a local mayor, suspicions regarding the company’s Chinese origins resulted in a legal and political battle in the town of Big Rapids, which have delayed Gotion’s plans significantly.

Northvolt is another player whose gigafactory plans have seen delays – the company has fallen into bankruptcy and many of its facilities have stopped production. While Lyten, a lithium-sulfur developer, has made moves to acquire Northvolt’s American and European facilities, this represents a delay to lithium-ion battery production rollout in both regions.

However, global production capacity is still set to almost double over the next decade, with gigafactories in the United States and Europe taking a larger percentage of the global total.

Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard.
The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule.
In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months.","On October 11, 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a final rule pursuant to section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) imposing a one-time reporting obligation on entities that manufactured (including imported) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at any time between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022, to the extent the information is “known or reasonably ascertainable.” “Manufacture” is defined to mean manufacture (including import) “for a commercial purpose.” Information required to be reported includes company and plant site information, chemical-specific information, categories of use, manufactured amounts, by-product reporting, environmental and health effects, worker exposure data, and disposal data; reporting is required on a chemical-specific basis and for each “site” where the chemical is manufactured/imported. This rule is the direct result of a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2020, which required EPA to require reporting by PFAS manufacturers. EPA therefore did not have flexibility with respect to whether to finalize the rule; they did, however, have discretion with respect to the scope of the rule, including whether to apply exemptions found in other TSCA contexts (for example, exemptions for article importers, the manufacture of by-products and impurities, and manufacture for research and development (R&D) purposes). Despite overwhelming public comment regarding the need for such exemptions, EPA declined to apply any of these exemptions in the 2023 final rule.

Application to “Chemical Substances”; Exclusion of FDA-Regulated Substances – The PFAS reporting rule applies to “chemical substances,” which is defined by TSCA § 3 to exclude “any food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device (as such terms are defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) when manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for use as a food, food additive, drug, cosmetic, or device.” As a general matter, the rule’s direct impact on companies working under FDA oversight, including those in the drug, biologics, food, medical device, and cosmetics sectors, may be relatively limited. Companies should consider what manufacturing activities (including import of any PFAS chemicals or import of PFAS-containing mixtures or articles) may fall outside of this exclusion and therefore be subject to reporting under the PFAS reporting rule. For example, applicability of the exemption is less clear when PFAS are produced (or PFAS/PFAS-containing articles are imported) for multiple end uses.

Companies evaluating potential reporting obligations under the PFAS reporting rule should evaluate their operations and records in light of the “known or reasonably ascertainable” standard. Data reported under the rule (unless covered by a valid and timely confidential business information (CBI) claim) will be publicly available and available to competitors, advocacy groups, and plaintiffs’ attorneys.

The November 2025 Proposal: Proposed Exemptions; Proposed Change to Reporting Window

EPA has now proposed significant changes to the scope of the TSCA PFAS reporting rule. Specifically, in a November 13, 2025 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA announced that it is proposing to exempt the following “manufacture” from the scope of reportable PFAS manufacturing activity under the rule:

Import of PFAS in articles

PFAS in mixtures or articles below 0.1% (a “de minimis” exemption)

Manufacture of PFAS as by-products, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates and

Manufacture (including import) of PFAS in small quantities for R&D purposes (specifically, in such “quantities of a chemical substance manufactured, imported, or processed or proposed to be manufactured, imported, or processed solely for research and development that are not greater than reasonably necessary for such purposes”)

EPA has also proposed changing the reporting window. Currently, the reporting window is currently set to open April 13, 2026; most reporting entities have 6 months to report, except that small manufacturers that are required to report only because of their import of PFAS-containing articles have a full year. In the current proposal, EPA proposes opening the reporting window 60 days after the effective date of a final rule; EPA also proposes shortening the window allowed for reporting from 6 months to 3 months. (Because, under the proposal, article importers would not be required to report, there would be no need for a longer reporting window for small manufacturer article importers.)

Next Steps and Looking Ahead

EPA will accept comments on the proposal through December 29, 2025. Companies should evaluate potential obligations under the existing rule and whether the proposed revisions align with operational and strategic priorities; consider submitting comments to individually or through industry associations to ensure relevant stakeholder perspectives are reflected in the administrative record.

The TSCA PFAS reporting rulemaking highlights the breadth of federal PFAS oversight, as well as the growing intersection between EPA’s PFAS-focused initiatives and the FDA’s ongoing oversight of chemicals and materials used in food and medical products. Parallel monitoring of both agencies’ regulatory initiatives is essential to effectively manage compliance, supply chain transparency, and associated liability considerations.",https://www.venable.com/assets/images/favicon.png,N,,2025-11-20 19:59:32.332074

Duke Energy (DUK) has submitted proposals to the North Carolina Utilities Commission seeking to adjust rates for its Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress utilities. The company aims for a $1 billion annual revenue increase, with Duke Energy Carolinas targeting $727 million in 2027 and $275 million in 2028, translating to a 15% revenue rise. Duke Energy Progress requests an increase of $729 million, broken down into $528 million for 2027 and $200 million for 2028, marking a 15.1% rise.

The basis for these requests is a 10.95% return on equity, alongside a 53% equity capital structure, pending regulatory approval. Duke Energy anticipates its nuclear operations will yield substantial tax credits through 2032, with the current rates facilitating a $150 million return in nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Carolinas customers for 2025-2026. Additionally, the company plans to expand these credits to Duke Energy Progress customers and incorporate solar and hydro tax credits for both utilities.

The proposed merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress is projected to result in customer savings exceeding $1 billion. Moreover, self-healing technology has minimized customer outages by over 1.1 million incidents in the first 10 months of 2025, saving nearly 2.6 million hours of downtime.

Duke Energy Corp, one of the largest US utilities, operates regulated utilities in the Carolinas, Indiana, Florida, Ohio, and Kentucky, delivering electricity to more than 8 million customers. Its natural gas utilities serve more than 1.6 million customers. With a market capitalization of approximately $95.3 billion, Duke Energy is a significant player in the Utilities sector, specifically within the Utilities - Regulated industry.

Financial Health Analysis

Duke Energy's financial health is underscored by its consistent revenue growth and robust profitability metrics:

Revenue growth over the past three years stands at 7.1%.

The company boasts a operating margin of 27.11% and a net margin of 15.76%.

Its EBITDA margin is an impressive 52.5%.

However, the balance sheet reveals some areas of concern:

The current ratio is 0.63, indicating potential liquidity issues.

A debt-to-equity ratio of 1.74 suggests a high level of leverage.

The Altman Z-Score of 0.72 places the company in the distress zone, implying a possibility of financial distress.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Duke Energy's valuation metrics provide insights into its market positioning:

The P/E ratio is 19.27, close to its 5-year low, suggesting potential undervaluation.

The P/S ratio of 3.02 is near its 3-year high, indicating a premium valuation.

The P/B ratio of 1.89 is close to its 10-year high, reflecting market confidence.

Analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $136.17 and a recommendation score of 2.5. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 41.13 suggest the stock is approaching oversold territory.

Risk Assessment

While Duke Energy demonstrates strong operational metrics, several risks warrant attention:

The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.41 is below the preferred threshold, indicating potential challenges in meeting interest obligations.

Sector-specific risks include regulatory changes and environmental concerns.

The beta of 0.25 suggests lower volatility compared to the market, providing some stability.

Overall, Duke Energy's strategic initiatives, including rate adjustments and tax credit utilization, position it for potential growth, albeit with financial and sector-specific risks that require careful monitoring.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000B1C.png?20,N,,2025-11-20 18:01:42.490630

She lingered near locked gates posted with warnings to keep out of the “hazardous substance area,” where long-shuttered chemical plants had dumped toxic waste on marshlands, and recounted the refinery explosion that changed her life.

Angulo was just 12 years old when a massive explosion rocked Chevron’s accident-prone Richmond refinery, four miles up the road. Towering clouds of black smoke darkened the skies for hours that summer day in 2012, forcing 15,000 residents to seek medical care for chest pain, headaches and asthma, among other ailments.

The catastrophic fire haunts the collective memory of this working-class town, where industrial accidents regularly plague largely Black and Latino neighborhoods surrounded by polluting railroads, deepwater ports and freeways. It also turned a generation of young people into climate activists.

“That fire was a big catalyst for a lot of us,” said Angulo, now 25, who co-founded the climate justice group led by gender-queer activists called Rich City Rays and organizes non-violent protests against Chevron, the second-largest greenhouse gas emitter in California.

Angulo, a first-generation Mexican-American, grew up with asthma. But she didn’t connect her breathing problems to Richmond’s rampant pollution until the refinery fire left so many gasping for air. Now she sees the oil-storage tanks blanketing the hills beyond her mother’s kitchen window as “symbols of harm along the hillside.”

And experts worry that the health costs of living in a heavily polluted city could reverberate for generations if little is done to curb heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. That’s because surging seas will increase flood risks for hazardous sites in Richmond and other overburdened cities along U.S. coasts, scientists at the University of California, China’s Nanjing University and Climate Central, a nonprofit science organization, warn in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Communications.

Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color face a disproportionate share of the risk, they found.

Rachel Morello-Frosch, an environmental-health disparities expert at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author on the study, has spent the past several years evaluating climate pollution’s likely impacts on low-lying industrial regions and vulnerable populations.

Burning fossil fuels makes flooding not only more destructive, by destabilizing the climate and supercharging waves, storms and high tides, but also more dangerous, by releasing toxic substances like petroleum and untreated sewage in the path of roiling floodwaters.

Morello-Frosch worries that toxic floodwaters are more likely to imperil low-income communities of color like Richmond because decades of discriminatory housing, lending and employment practices have left residents stuck living near polluting industries without the means to mitigate harm when disaster strikes.

To help communities and policymakers prepare for future threats, the research team conducted the first national assessment of unequal risks from flooded hazardous sites related to sea level rise. Of nearly 48,000 U.S. facilities that store, handle, produce or release harmful substances, they identified 5,500 that are likely to experience a 1-in-100-year flood event—that is, an uncommonly large flood that has a 1 percent chance of happening in any year—by 2100. Nearly 3,800 sites are likely to flood by 2050.

Curbing emissions would spare a few hundred sites by 2100, the team found. But past climate pollution has “locked in” projected flood risks over the short term.

“Over 5,000 facilities are projected to be at risk of a 1-in-100-year flooding event in 2100 if we don’t do anything, and we just learned that we’re failing to meet the 1.5 degree Celsius benchmark,” said Morello-Frosch, referring to the Paris Agreement target to avoid potentially irreversible effects of climate change.

About two dozen coastal states plus Puerto Rico are likely to see at least some hazardous facilities flood. But the vast majority of at-risk facilities are concentrated in just seven states. Topping the list is Louisiana, with its dense concentration of oil and gas wells, followed by Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York and Massachusetts.

Oil and gas wells and industrial facilities that emit toxic chemicals tracked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxics Release Inventory together make up nearly 70 percent of sites likely to flood by century’s end. Other facilities include sewage treatment plants; ports and terminals that import, export and store fossil fuels; former defense sites; and power plants.

Exposure to toxic substances like pathogen-laden raw sewage, industrial chemicals and hydrocarbons has been linked to numerous short- and long-term health conditions, including heart problems, cancer and respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin conditions, risks that can persist for residents and clean-up workers long after floodwaters recede.

Overburdened communities like Richmond, where poverty and other social stressors exacerbate environmental exposures, are 50 percent more likely to be within a kilometer (0.6 miles) of a hazardous site at risk of flooding by century’s end, the new study found. Hispanic residents, single parents, nonvoters, renters, people over 65, and those in poverty, without access to a vehicle or with limited English skills are up to 41 percent more likely to live near an at-risk site.

“Ideally we would have a federal government that was enabling communities to plan and respond and proactively address these risks,” Morello-Frosch said. “But right now, these states are left to their own devices,” she said, referring to the Trump administration’s massive cuts to federal disaster relief and related programs.

And as it becomes increasingly difficult to access federal resources and data, including datasets used in this study, she said, states are going to have a harder time addressing future threats.

“A Legacy of State-Sponsored Racism”

Angulo studied a map showing nearly two dozen hazardous sites likely to flood in her hometown: Superfund and cleanup sites like the one at the marsh, fossil fuel ports, chemical manufacturers, a sewage treatment plant and the Chevron refinery, which emitted most of the 812,000 pounds of toxic chemicals, heavy metals and carcinogens released last year by Richmond’s industrial facilities.

An elementary school, Peres K-8, where children play downwind of the refinery next to a major freeway, lies within a half mile of two chemical plants likely to flood.

“A petroleum pipeline runs right under the sidewalk in front of the school,” Angulo said.

The new study excludes pipelines despite their vulnerability during severe floods, the authors said, because national data on pipeline locations is limited.

Angulo was not surprised to see the concentration of at-risk industrial sites around the Iron Triangle, where less than 10 percent of residents are white, and North Richmond, a small unincorporated community where 96 percent of residents are people of color.

“It’s a legacy of state-sponsored racism and state-sponsored segregation,” Angulo said, referring to federal housing policies that, until passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, considered people of color threats to property values.

Around Richmond, Angulo said, “neighborhoods like North Richmond and the Iron Triangle were historically the only places Black and brown folks were allowed to own houses.”

Even though Black migrants fleeing the Jim Crow South helped Richmond build more warships than any other U.S. shipyard during World War II, they were denied access to government-insured loans and had to resort to makeshift construction materials. “That’s why Parchester Village was built,” she said.

Parchester Village, promoted as a “community for all Americans,” was surrounded by heavy industry and flanked by two railways.

Thomasina Horsley grew up in Parchester Village, where heavy rains inundated the housing tract soon after it was built in 1949. Her mother, Margaret, one of Parchester’s original residents, remembers floodwaters rushing from one end of the neighborhood to the other.

Engineers warned county officials in the 1950s that a “dangerous mixture of oil and water” would pass through Parchester if a storage tank up the hill in the “tank farm” run by Chevron’s predecessor, Standard Oil, were to burst during a storm.

Parchester’s flooding problems were compounded after developers removed a eucalyptus grove on a hill near the old tank farm about five years ago to build million-dollar homes, Horsley said. Without the trees to catch water during heavy rains, she said, “there’s water all over.”

The city is working to fix the problem, just one of many in a city of ever-present dangers.

“We’ve had so many bad things happen, people just go into survival mode,” said Horsley.

Like the time in 1993 when a railroad tank car at a now-defunct chemical company released a miles-long cloud of sulfuric acid over homes, sending 24,000 to local hospitals and leading to a $180 million class-action settlement.

“There’s always these tanks around with something leaking,” Horsley said. “Then we get the downwinds all the time with all these chemicals coming from Chevron. You smell them all the time.”

Living near some of California’s biggest pollution sources has created and exacerbated residents’ health problems.

People who have asthma are more sensitive to chemical emissions, but they’re living near some of the highest emissions while lacking access to healthcare, Angulo said. “It’s just like a triple whammy of harm.”

Both Angulo and her sister grew up with asthma, but their brother, who grew up in Mexico rather than Richmond, did not. Plus, there’s no history of asthma in their family. “It’s a clear signal that growing up here is what did it,” she said.

About 25 percent of Richmond residents have asthma, compared to 13 percent of California residents. Asthma emergency department visits in the Iron Triangle are higher than 99 percent of California census tracts, state data shows.

So many people are already suffering from industry’s noxious releases, Angulo said. How are they supposed to handle even more toxic threats from rising seas when they have nowhere else to go?

“Blatant Neglect”

Doria Robinson, a third-generation Richmond native who serves on the city council, runs a community food project called Urban Tilth in North Richmond. The farm, which hires and trains local residents to support a healthier community, sits half a mile from a sewage plant likely to flood.

Two creeks flank the farm, which regularly saw “massive flooding” until about a decade ago, when the county raised their levees, Robinson said, pointing beyond rows of leafy greens and flowers as roosters crowed behind her.

“But now we’re in a new regime with climate change and storm events that are just unheard of, like atmospheric rivers,” she said, referring to powerful storms that have become even stronger as the world warms. “How many record-breaking storm events can you have in a season that are supposed to come every 100 years?”

Robinson helped the city negotiate a deal in which Chevron agreed to pay Richmond $500 million over the next 10 years instead of tens of millions each year in a “polluters pay” refinery tax.

“For us to have a multinational, multibillion-dollar corporation right here in our backyard with the amount of disinvestment in the community, the amount of deferred investment in our infrastructure, the built environment that makes up this city is just,” Robinson said, pausing to find the right words, “just blatant neglect.”

Chevron is an essential part of Richmond’s and the region’s economy, contributing over $1 billion in economic activity annually, Caitlin Powell, a spokesperson for the Richmond refinery, said in a statement. “Our recent agreement with the city underscores the essential nature of our relationship with the city, and we hope the associated additional funding will be used responsibly and transparently to help our Richmond community flourish.”

Robinson wants the Chevron tax settlement funds to go toward reversing decades of lack of investment. “I strongly believe that we need to focus on these types of threats that are only going to be exacerbated by climate change, and put some resources toward trying to figure out how to get ahead of them,” she said.

She’s particularly worried about how rising seas will affect hazardous waste sites that were “cleaned up” by capping the soil with concrete and asphalt.

When Robinson thinks about sea level rise, she thinks about saltwater pushing groundwater up against those caps, inundating toxic soils and carrying contaminants into old, poorly maintained sewer pipes that run under houses, parks and schools.

“We’ve got an old DDT factory and all these other things where supposedly a cap was gonna save us,” she said. “Our grand plan to use these massive caps is totally undermined by intrusion of water underground.”

Threats From Below

Robinson first heard about the threat of rising coastal groundwater from researchers at UC Berkeley who were not involved in the new study.

Emma Lasky, a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley, and her Ph.D. advisor, Kristina Hill, study the likelihood that groundwater will rise along with sea level and dislodge contaminants at hazardous sites capped with materials like concrete.

“When we thought of the problem as rain spreading the contaminant through infiltration, it made sense and it sounded cost effective,” said Hill, referring to the concrete cap. “It was like putting an umbrella over the contaminant.”

But now, said Hill, associate professor of landscape architecture and environmental planning at UC Berkeley, “we see that it’s about water rising up from below and even changing flow directions.”

As dense saltwater moves inland, studies show, it slides under and pushes groundwater toward the surface, where it can mobilize contaminants once sequestered in groundwater and soil.

Lasky is looking at how seasonal variability in precipitation affects the concentration and movement of toxics like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the contaminated Richmond marsh. Lasky and Hill think VOCs, which can prove harmful even at low levels, may be moving through sewer pipes, which can ferry volatile chemicals thousands of feet, and entering homes through broken toilet seals, shower drains or cracks in home foundations.

To understand how rising waters might affect VOCs, Lasky placed sampling devices on sewer laterals, which connect main sewer lines to buildings, to compare the chemicals’ concentrations during the dry season and after atmospheric rivers, which served as a proxy for sea level rise.

So far Lasky has found a chlorinated VOC linked to several cancers at higher concentrations during the rainy season. The finding suggests that an influx of VOC-tainted water, whether from heavy rains or surging seas, could enter cracks in sewer systems and seep into buildings.

Lasky hasn’t tested for VOCs in homes served by the sewer that runs through the marsh yet. But she’s concerned that, if she finds them, people may not have the money to make repairs. She’s even more concerned that most people don’t even know about the problem.

Lasky and Hill are doing their best to sound the alarm.

Since high tides and heavy rains can raise groundwater enough to mobilize contaminants, Hill said, “the impact of sea level rise is really a game of inches, not of feet.”

And that’s a major concern for coastal sites as contaminated as the Richmond shoreline.

The marsh usually floods with heavy rains, Angulo said. “Baxter Creek runs right through all of this super-toxic land,” she said, pointing beyond the fence posted with “keep out” signs. “All of the rainwater, all the ocean water that flows back up, gets mixed in with all the chemicals in the dirt.”

The creek flows through people’s backyards on the other side of the freeway in a public housing complex. “It’s a majority Black, brown and low-income community, which as we know are the most at-risk when it comes to health impacts,” she said. And now, when bigger and bigger rains come and sea level continues to rise with climate change, she added, they’re sitting on a “ticking time bomb.”

Resilience Denied

As the rate of sea level rise continues to accelerate, scientists expect to see rapid increases in the frequency of flooding from high tides along U.S. coastlines as soon as the next decade.

Still, compared to an extreme weather event like a hurricane, sea level rise is relatively slow-moving, giving states and municipalities time to prepare, said Morello-Frosch.

She hopes agencies use the study results to prioritize resources for communities facing significant threats by doing more site-specific assessments, looking at other hazardous facilities like pipelines, accounting for rising groundwater and supporting more resilience planning.

The results can also help vulnerable communities advocate for incorporating sea level projections into cleanup plans for hazardous sites, she said.

Urban Tilth’s Robinson was trying to address how climate change might multiply the dangers of North Richmond’s industrial hazards when she helped secure a $19 million Community Change Grant from the Biden administration’s EPA.

“The grant was going to be a major investment in an area that has just taken the brunt and carried the burden of fossil fuel impacts for 100 years,” Robinson said.

The North Richmond Resilience Initiative was one of more than 400 grants funded by the Inflation Reduction Act that the Trump administration canceled in March. It would have created green space at the elementary school near the at-risk wastewater treatment plant to filter pollutants from a massive warehouse being built next door. It would have transformed an abandoned public housing project into affordable, energy-efficient homes. It would have created a community disaster response hub at Urban Tilth, among other projects.

When California Reps. John Garamendi and Mark DeSaulnier urged the EPA to reinstate the congressionally mandated appropriations, they were told the initiative funds programs that “promote or take part in DEI or environmental justice,” undercutting the agency’s priority “to eliminate discrimination” in its programs.

The EPA press office did not respond to a request to point out discriminatory programs in the grant.

Robinson was shocked when she saw the EPA’s reason for canceling the grant. The grant was trying to address a long history of compounding threats focusing on the geography of North Richmond, not on specific populations, Robinson said. “It’s literally the design of the grant to be geographic.”

That geography supported the growth of heavy industry that still dominates Richmond long after its industrial heyday and continues to take a toll on residents’ health.

Back at the contaminated marsh, Angulo recalled that she and her friends didn’t think about the long-term impacts of living in an industrial town when they were younger. As if on cue, a siren blared in the distance.

A siren goes off every Wednesday to make sure the community warning system is working in case a disaster strikes. For Angulo, it’s a constant reminder of that clear blue day in 2012 when massive clouds of black smoke blotted out the sun and stole her innocence.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P1140741-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:59:22.348220

From hurricanes to economic challenges, our state has faced adversity time and again, proving that we can rise, adapt and rebuild.

But the next chapter of resilience isn’t just about recovery; it’s about readiness. True resilience means anticipating challenges before they happen. At Entergy Louisiana, we believe that by planning ahead, strengthening grid infrastructure and investing in innovation, we can deliver reliable power to our communities no matter what.

Entergy Louisiana is investing an average of $380 million per year from 2024 through 2028 to upgrade approximately 3,240 miles of distribution and transmission lines and an estimated 62,000 structures. These upgrades reinforce our system to better withstand high winds, floods, ice storms, fires and other extreme events, ensuring reliable service when Louisiana needs it most.

Investing in grid hardening ahead of storms is not just about reliability—it’s also the most cost-effective approach. Upfront resilience investments reduce long-term costs for customers by preventing widespread damage, shortening outages, and avoiding the much higher expense of emergency restoration after a major storm. Every dollar spent proactively helps keep future costs down and protects the communities we serve.

By combining strong infrastructure with cutting-edge technology, Entergy is not only strengthening reliability today but preparing Louisiana’s grid for tomorrow. As industries, businesses and households demand more consistent, high-quality power, our modernization efforts ensure the grid can support that growth and keep Louisiana competitive.

These grid enhancements also support the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, key components of building a more sustainable energy network for the state. The ability to balance traditional energy sources with renewables is what will enable Louisiana to meet its energy needs in a sustainable way.

For generations, Louisianians have understood resilience as the ability to recover quickly from difficulties. But it is also the capacity to withstand, to remain steady and unaffected when tested.

We’re being proactive by designing systems that can operate through natural disasters, economic shifts and other challenges without disruption. Every investment we make in grid modernization, every upgrade to our infrastructure and every partnership we pursue is part of a shared commitment to keep the lights on.

Across Wisconsin, between 43 percent and 90 percent of the state’s 3.7 million acres of wetlands are at risk of losing protections.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

On Monday, the U.S. EPA and Army Corps of Engineers proposed a set of new rules that would leave millions of acres of wetlands, small waterbodies, and ephemeral streams across the country unprotected — threatening the drinking water of millions of Americans and leaving crucial habitat and floodplains susceptible to filling.

These proposed changes were anticipated by many. Their groundwork was laid in 2022, when the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark decision that the Clean Water Act’s protections only applied to bodies of water that maintained a continuous surface connection to traditional, navigable waters — a rigid order that is incompatible with the naturally fluctuating connectivity of many crucial watersheds.

Under the Trump Administration’s push for a new era of energy dominance, it was only a matter of time before the Supreme Court’s precedent was adopted into federal code.

“When finalized, the rule will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act,” a statement from the EPA reads.

In March, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) analyzed the potential impacts of this very scenario.

The non-profit estimated that between 38 million and 70 million acres of wetlands across the country — up to 90 percent of its total wetlands — would become exposed to filling, dredging, and pollution under federal actions similar to those proposed on Monday.

No states stand to potentially lose more than Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Even in the least damaging of the three regulatory scenarios NRDC modeled — categorized as “Damaging,” “More Damaging,” and “Most Damaging” — they were the only states to lose protections for more than 1 million acres of wetlands.

By one token, the vulnerability of wetlands in these three states is a simple function of existence — the more habitat they have, the more they stand to lose.

In Context: The Next Deluge May Go Differently

Compared to the rest of the Great Lakes basin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have retained the greatest share of their historic wetlands: roughly 50 percent each. By contrast, Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana have each already lost between 85 percent and 90 percent of these ecosystems since pre-colonization.

Regionally, these risks are concentrated to three specific areas: shoreline along Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, woodland bogs in northern Minnesota, and the agricultural communities of the Wisconsin River watershed.

In each, the potential erosion of wetlands — often called “nature’s kidneys” for their ability to filter pollutants and absorb excess water — means the impacts of existing and looming climate changes are likely to worsen.

Wetter Winters In Delta County, Michigan

According to NRDC data, between 31 percent (Damaging) and 95 percent (Most Damaging) of Michigan’s 3.8 million acres of wetlands are vulnerable to lost protections.

The largest share of these at-risk wetlands, nearly 210,000 acres, is in Delta County, which hugs the northern shore of Lake Michigan in the state’s Upper Peninsula. One-fifth of the county’s properties are at risk of flooding over the next 30 years, a figure that will likely increase if floodplains — nature’s best buffer against extreme storm and river surges — are lost.

The area is home to parts of the Hiawatha National Forest and Escanaba River State Forest.

According to Delta County’s 2023 Hazard Mitigation Plan, the county’s 211 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline are most vulnerable to flooding as a result of fluctuating water levels, snowmelt, and seiches. By the latter half of the century, winter and spring rains are expected to intensify by at least 20 percent.

“The Escanaba and Gladstone municipal harbors are at lower elevations than nearby residential structures; future lakeshore flooding damage may also be localized in these areas,” the report reads.

Exacerbating the loss of protections is how much the area has to gain from dedicated conservation. Maps created by the Michigan Department of Environment, Energy, and Great Lakes forecast that much of Delta County’s shoreline, especially along the Bays De Noc, have the potential to reap the highest measurable benefits from wetland restoration.

Wildfire Risks In Koochiching and St. Louis Counties, Minnesota

No state in the Lower-48 has more regulatory wetlands than Minnesota, with nearly 11 million acres. Between 59 percent and 83 percent of these would be left unprotected by the Clean Water Act, according to NRDC data.

The largest swaths lay just west of Lake Superior’s shores, in Koochiching and St. Louis counties, where under the “Most Damaging” NRDC scenario more than 2 million acres of wetlands, primarily forest bogs, would be left exposed.

These vulnerabilities coincide with the region — home to several state forests, Superior National Forest, and Voyageurs National Park — experiencing more intense wildfire seasons. This May, the Brimson Complex wildfires burned more than 29,000 acres in and around St. Louis County as moderate drought conditions set in across the northern half of the state.

“We are trending toward hotter, drier weather, and that is going to change the fire situation,” Sarah Strommen, head of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told the New York Times this summer. “It is hard to compare what has been historically the normal fire season pattern in the state of Minnesota and what we’re seeing now and going forward.”

For up to five years after wildfire, the risk of flooding is significantly higher. Vegetation loss, charred ground, and dry soils allow for rainwater to flow rapidly across the landscape — surges that wetlands, which naturally absorb excess water, do well to mitigate.

Warming temperatures also mean that the number of days in northeastern Minnesota with snow cover is expected to fall by between 14 and 19 days, resulting in a wildfire season that will begin earlier and stretch later.

By 2040, according to state data, at least one-third of the region’s population is expected to be 65 years-old or older, leaving communities especially vulnerable to the impacts of flooding, wildfire, and heat and precipitation changes.

Agricultural Pollution In Marathon County, Wisconsin

Home to the Wisconsin River watershed in the state’s interior, agricultural Marathon County faces acute threats to its groundwater quality — a challenge now doubly threatened by the county’s potential to lose protections for up to 167,365 acres of its wetlands, making it Wisconsin’s most vulnerable region.

Home to more than 2,000 farms, the county’s water quality is in dire straits. A draft of its 2026 Comprehensive Plan identifies nonpoint runoff pollution as one of its most pressing concerns, and its Farmland Preservation Plan plainly states that “the area’s biggest challenge is surface water quality issues.”

Multiple waterways across the county — spanning the Rib River, Big Eau Pleine River, and Little Eau Pleine River watersheds — remain listed as phosphorus-impaired by the state’s Department of Natural Resources. The county’s wells were also hotspots for nitrate contamination, as analyzed by an Alliance for the Great Lakes report published this September.

In Wausau, the county’s most populated city, PFAS contamination also remains an ongoing concern. Between 2019 and 2022, all water samples measured from the city’s six wells contained levels of forever chemicals that exceeded local health service standards.

In recent studies, constructed wetlands and fungi have shown promise as nature-based solutions to filtering PFAS from running waterways.

Overall, Duke Energy reported record annual revenue of $30 billion in 2024 for its six-state region.
Duke Energy is shooting for annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% over the next few years, CEO Harry Sideris said in November.","Duke Energy is asking state regulators to approve an increase of more than 13% in its rates in 2027 for residential customers, with business customers likely to see smaller increases.

The requests continue a trend of sharply higher electricity costs over the past decade. Residential rates in the U.S. climbed 32% in the last decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, outpacing the overall inflation rate.

The utility says customers in the Charlotte and Triad areas using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would pay about $17 more per month starting Jan. 1, 2027, an increase to about $162 per month. It is also proposing a nearly 4% increase in 2028, putting the monthly bill at about $168.50.

Across 2027-2028, commercial customers would see an average increase of 8.7% and 3.9% while industrial customers would see hikes of 6.3% and 3.4%.

In Duke’s eastern North Carolina region, the average residential customer would see a $23 increase to about $187 a month, then another $6.59 a month in 2028. In those two years, commercial customers would see an average increase of 9.2% and 4.6%, while industrial customers would see an average increase of around 7.4% and 4.3%.

The N.C. Utilities Commission will study the rate increases, which Duke says would boost revenue by about $1.78 billion over the two years in its Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress divisions. The company is planning to merge the units, which have remained distinct from a regulatory basis since Duke Energy and Progress Energy merged in 2012. Overall, Duke Energy reported record annual revenue of $30 billion in 2024 for its six-state region.

Regulators require the utility to balance the needs of ratepayers and investors while maintaining a reliable energy grid. “It’s important to strike the right balance of prioritizing investments that enhance the energy grid for current and future needs while also maximizing cost-saving measures for our customers,” Kendal Bowman, Duke’s North Carolina president, said in a release.

Duke and other utilities are planning record capital investments over the next decade to boost generation capacity because of demand for power from manufacturers, electric vehicles and data centers that enable AI computing.

“The cost of electricity is skyrocketing,” says Kevin Martin of the Carolinas Utility Customers Association, a Raleigh group representing businesses. “Load growth is coming on and not just data centers. There’s also population growth and utilities have to build infrastructure and increase transmission and distribution systems.”

It’s typical for the Utilities Commission to reduce Duke’s rate request following testimony by his and other groups, Martin notes. That debate often centers on the amount of profit sought by the utility.

If approved, the rates would enable Duke to earn a return on equity of 10.95%, the company said. The average return on equity in 2024 for electricity and natural gas utilities was 9.7%, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Nationally, policymakers and regulators appear supportive of utilities, “creating a favorable backdrop for the strongest rate base and earnings growth outlook the sector has seen in decades,” analyst Timothy Winter of New York-based Gabelli Funds said in a July research report. “Notably, rising electric demand enables utilities to spread infrastructure costs over a larger customer base, helping to mitigate affordability concerns.”

But utilities have to execute effectively by raising funds, building infrastructure and managing costs to hit their profit goals, Winter noted.

Duke Energy is shooting for annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% over the next few years, CEO Harry Sideris said in November. Duke’s shares have returned an average 11.6% over the past three years, including dividends. That compares with a 20.3% return by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF over the same period.

Over the last decade, Duke said rates have increased more for residential customers than business ones because the utility has invested heavily in upgrading its distribution grid. Moreover, shifting weather trends mean Duke plans its generation needs around the winter peak, versus a summer peak historically, and residential heating needs account for a significant part of the winter peak. Regulators require the company to charge customer classes based on its costs, spokesman Bill Norton said.

Duke faces inflationary pressures like all businesses. “From transformers to poles to power lines, material costs have increased dramatically over the last few years,” Norton says. He notes prices for essential grid items such as transmission crossarms, distribution transformers and voltage regulators have more than doubled over the past five years. Duke’s size enables it to negotiate better prices than smaller utilities, but material prices have climbed substantially, he adds.",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Duke-Energy-Transmission-lines.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 17:01:52.270596

11/20/2025 - 04:29 PM

Targeted investments will harden the grid against storms and upgrade existing power plants to maximize efficiency, saving customers money

New energy infrastructure will support rapid growth from increasing population, advanced manufacturing and data centers – with customer protections built in

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed requests with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) for revised rates at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, its two utilities in the state.

By the numbers: The company's filing with the NCUC requests an annual revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas ($727 million in 2027, $275 million in 2028), which represents a 15% increase over current revenues, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress ($528 million in 2027, $200 million in 2028), a 15.1% increase over current revenues. The company's requests are based on a 10.95% return on equity and 53% equity capital structure and are subject to NCUC approval.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical Duke Energy Carolinas residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $17.22 a month – from $144.98 to $162.20 – starting Jan. 1, 2027, followed by a $6.34 increase on Jan. 1, 2028. Across 2027-2028, commercial customers would see an average increase of 8.7% and 3.9% while industrial customers would see an average increase of around 6.3% and 3.4%.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical Duke Energy Progress residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $23.11 a month – from $163.84 to $186.95 – starting Jan. 1, 2027, followed by a $6.59 increase on Jan. 1, 2028. Across 2027-2028, commercial customers would see an average increase of 9.2% and 4.6% while industrial customers would see an average increase of around 7.4% and 4.3%.

Our view:

""Our goal is to deliver reliable power at the lowest possible cost for customers,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""It's important to strike the right balance of prioritizing investments that enhance the energy grid for current and future needs while also maximizing cost-saving measures for our customers.""

In addition to reducing operation and maintenance expenses since the last base rate case, other examples of cost-saving measures include:

The storm bonds Duke Energy issued following Hurricane Helene and other major storms are saving North Carolina customers $422 million.

Duke Energy's highly efficient nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits through 2032. Current rates return $150 million in nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Carolinas customers in 2025-2026; the new rate request proposes extending nuclear production tax credits to Duke Energy Progress customers and adding solar and hydro tax credits for both utilities.

Falling fuel price savings were passed along to customers last winter, reducing Duke Energy Carolinas rates by 6.2% and Duke Energy Progress rates by 4.5%.

The proposed combination of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress would save customers more than $1 billion in future costs.

Driving improved reliability: As part of its ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has tripled the number of North Carolina customers served by self-healing technology since 2022, significantly reducing outages. Today, 75% of customers are served by this technology, and it's making a difference: In the first 10 months of 2025, self-healing technology helped avoid more than 1.1 million customer outages in North Carolina and saved nearly 2.6 million hours of total outage time.

Other investments over the last five years have been more traditional: 43,500 miles of vegetation trimmed, 116,430 distribution poles replaced and 13,403 wood transmission poles upgraded to steel or concrete. Notably, zero non-wood poles across the Carolinas required replacement after Hurricane Helene, significantly accelerating power restoration following the most destructive storm in state history.

Powering economic growth: Duke Energy serves 3.6 million retail customers across the state and added about 150,000 customers in North Carolina over the last two years – primarily residences and small businesses. Driven by the state's economic success, electricity demand is rising at an unprecedented pace; in 2025 alone, companies have announced new projects bringing more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments to North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

The company is making cost-effective investments to reliably power this growth by:

Maximizing the value of existing generation , making it more efficient and able to generate more electricity to meet near-term growth needs at the lowest possible cost. For example, Duke Energy is adding nearly 300 megawatts (MW) of clean capacity through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations by 2031 – part of a nuclear fleet that achieved the nation's lowest total operating cost per megawatt-hour in four of the past six years.

Adding new generation , such as the clean, highly efficient natural gas facilities the NCUC approved last year in Person and Catawba counties. The 2027-2028 Multiyear Rate Plan component of the rate request calls for investing $1.7 billion in battery storage projects across the region, complemented by nearly $400 million in solar and solar paired with storage projects – 276 MW of solar and 31 MW of paired storage.

Helping customers manage costs: ""Customers count on us to manage our costs on their behalf, but they also want options to manage their own bills now,"" Bowman said. ""That's why we're helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.""

To help customers with rising costs, Duke Energy deploys a coordinated strategy that integrates energy efficiency programs, bill management tools, financial assistance and agency partnerships – details can be found at duke-energy.com/help for income-qualified programs and duke-energy.com/BillHelp for conventional programs. Options include:

Weatherization : Helps income-qualified customers save energy and reduce expenses by installing energy conservation measures in their homes.

Neighborhood Energy Saver : Offers free home energy assessments designed to help customers in income-qualifying neighborhoods learn how their homes use energy and how to lower electric bills. Qualified customers can receive up to 17 free products, even an HVAC unit, installed at no cost.

High Energy Use Pilot : Provides income-qualified customers free assistance for energy improvements – including heating and cooling system replacements, duct sealing, lighting and heat pump water heaters.

Home Energy House Call : Offers all customers a free home energy assessment and personalized recommendations on how to improve energy efficiency.

Smart $aver : Offers home improvement rebates for energy efficiency upgrades such as heating and cooling systems, water heaters, insulation and sealing ductwork, and pool pumps.

Power Manager : Rewards customers with bill credits for shifting energy use away from peak periods for qualified home appliances (e.g., smart thermostat, HVAC/water heater).

PowerPair : Provides financial incentives for customers who install solar and/or battery systems to help manage system load.

For North Carolina residential customers, last year, these programs delivered the following average annual bill savings:

Home Energy House Call: $46.68 per home

Smart $aver: $125.22 per home

Weatherization: $150.34 per home

Across the Carolinas, the company's aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. And improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system.

Duke Energy Carolinas serves about 2 million households and businesses in Central and Western North Carolina, including Charlotte, Durham and the Triad, while Duke Energy Progress serves about 1.6 million customers in Central and Eastern North Carolina and in the Asheville region.

The two utilities last initiated base rate reviews in North Carolina in January 2023 and September 2022, respectively. If Duke Energy's request to combine the entities is approved by state and federal regulators next year, this would be the final base rate review conducted as separate utilities.

What's next: The NCUC is expected to issue an order calling for public hearings across the state in the spring followed by an evidentiary hearing next summer, then issue a final order on new rates in late 2026. Details on Duke Energy's proposal, the rate review process and the variety of assistance programs and billing options offered by the company can be found at duke-energy.com/NorthCarolinaRates.

The revised WOTUS definition aims to bring both the EPA and Corps regulations in line with the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA and provide clarity on the CWA’s regulatory scope.

Key elements of the proposed rule include:

Defining terms such as “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary.”

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow.

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year.

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

Adding a new exclusion for groundwater.

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

The EPA also announced it will hold two hybrid public meetings on the proposed rule. Information about these meetings is forthcoming.

Advocacy previously filed comments with the EPA in April when the agency was seeking input on this proposal. Advocacy specifically noted that small businesses “want WOTUS regulations that do not require them to hire attorneys or consultants to understand.”",https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/agency_US_Army_Corps_of_Engineers-1024x679.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:01:43.004779

This funding allows the CPIE team to support eligible facilities in North Carolina with technical assistance and application support.","The NC Clean Energy Technology Center (NCCETC) houses a team of experienced engineers that help identify practical solutions to reduce energy spending, while supporting sustainability or resilience. The Clean Power and Industrial Efficiency (CPIE) team has assisted large energy users, manufacturers, rural small businesses, agricultural producers, communities, and others with services tailored to their goals. The team primarily serves entities within North Carolina, however certain programs allow them to collaborate in areas throughout the Southeast United States.

Currently, the team is part of several programs that provide support to organizational professionals seeking assistance in preparing for their future energy use.

The CPIE team is committed to providing fact-based, technically accurate work to support various energy projects. The table below gives an overview of the services the team can offer through their many programs.

NCCETC is a member of the North Carolina Department of Commerce led project, Smart Manufacturing Adoption to Realize Transformative Energy Reductions for North Carolina (SMARTER NC), funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Both NC State University’s Industry Expansion Solutions (IES), an extension and outreach department, and NCCETC are on the team. Through the SMARTER NC project, small-to-medium manufacturers can receive assistance to offset costs and integrate “smart” manufacturing technologies. These technologies include practices like additive manufacturing, 3D printing, and any process where products are built in a way that reduces waste.

The CPIE team’s role in SMARTER NC is to provide energy assessments for facilities that are exploring opportunities in smart technology implementation. The energy assessments typically focus on the energy savings that will result from the smart technology of interest. If the technology relates to electricity, gas, or wastewater and does not have substantial energy savings, the team can perform a targeted assessment. A targeted energy assessment can look at a particular system such as instrument air, chillers, or boilers. If there is no system of interest, the team can do a general site walk-through assessment where they will observe all of the facility’s equipment to identify potential energy savings opportunities.

NCCETC Associate Director Isaac Panzarella is the head of the CPIE team, and also is the lead for the Southeast Onsite Energy Technical Assistance Partnership (TAP). This program is funded by the DOE and includes two partner universities: the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez (UPRM) and Tennessee Tech University. The Southeast Onsite Energy TAP is part of a network of 10 regional Onsite Energy TAPs, which help industrial facilities and large energy users transition to onsite energy practices that lower costs, reduce emissions, and contribute to the economy.

Onsite energy technologies include battery storage, district energy, fuel cells, geothermal systems, CHP, industrial heat pumps, renewable fuels, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal, thermal storage, wind power, and other distributed energy solutions. These technologies generate or store electric and thermal energy directly at the location where it is consumed, which gives it the term “onsite energy”. The Onsite Energy TAPs offer specialized, regionally specific services that include technical assistance, end user engagement, and stakeholder engagement.

The CPIE team can evaluate facilities for onsite energy opportunities and deliver advanced services to optimize economic impact while mitigating risks throughout the process. They also focus on education and outreach by actively engaging with policymakers, utilities, and other key stakeholders to identify pathways that make onsite energy integration more accessible.

Another project the CPIE team focuses on is the Pollution Prevention (P2) Program, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiative that supports businesses interested in adopting source reduction practices. Source reduction is any practice that reduces, eliminates, or prevents pollution at its source – before it gets recycled, treated, or disposed of. These practices help businesses save money and provide environmental benefits. East Carolina University is the primary grant recipient of the P2 Program with NCCETC as a sub awardee. Through this program, the CPIE team provides technical assistance to businesses in six national emphasis areas (NEAs). The EPA has identified six industrial sector NEAs that have many opportunities for pollution prevention, economic, and environmental impacts.

The six industrial NEAs are:

Food and Beverage Manufacturing and Processing

Chemical Manufacturing, Processing, and Formulation

Automotive Manufacturing and Maintenance

Aerospace Product and Parts Manufacturing and Maintenance

Metal Manufacturing and Fabrication

Pollution Prevention in Native American Communities and for Alaska Native Villages

NCCETC can assist these industries by conducting onsite energy assessments and providing training for site personnel.

The team has also been focused on a project that will help characterize resiliency when it comes to clean energy technologies. The Resilient Renewable Energy to Diminish Disaster Impacts on Communities (Resilient REDDI Communities) project is intended to develop a set of resiliency metrics and create a playbook that will guide communities interested in integrating energy resilience strategies. The CPIE team supports communities across North Carolina through this project, and has most recently been involved in efforts to implement microgrids throughout Asheville. The team has engaged with a network of emergency managers, utilities, community organizations, and other interested parties to learn which practices would be most beneficial when it comes to providing reliable energy in the event of a disaster.

Although many of the team’s projects focus on large-scale energy operations, the CPIE team also provides technical assistance through a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiative that reduces the cost burden for small business and agricultural producers who are looking to implement energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides funding for rural small business and agricultural producers that submit applications for the implementation of specific renewable energy technologies. The USDA has provided funding to NCCETC through the Renewable Energy Development Assistance (REDA) program and the USDA REAP Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) program. This funding allows the CPIE team to support eligible facilities in North Carolina with technical assistance and application support. The team can identify appropriate renewable technologies and conduct energy assessments to determine generation potential, project cost, projected savings, and technology viability.",https://nccleantech.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cropped-NCCETC-logo-No-Text-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-20 18:01:23.522185

Critics are disturbed by the route of the two proposed pipelines, now under review amid a surge of applications to build massive data centers in the region. Among their concerns: the lines, and compressor stations related to gas distribution, will be laid within hundreds of feet of each other in some locations in a North Carolina county and potentially disrupt rural lifestyles and landscapes.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Virginia environmental regulators are reviewing long-running requests from Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC and the Williams Companies Inc. for billion-dollar extensions that would link to pivotal and existing crosscountry networks.

Mountain Valley Pipeline is seeking to build 31 miles of pipeline from Virginia into North Carolina, extending a 303-mile network that now cuts from the Marcellus and Utica shale along the Pennsylvania border through West Virginia to southern Virginia. MVP’s proposal, called the Southgate Extension, has been reviewed and revised since 2020. Mountain Valley is also requesting to add compressor stations along its main line: three in West Virginia and one in Montgomery County, Virginia, about 70 miles near where Southgate would begin.

The Williams Companies is requesting approval to build 55 new miles of pipeline to bolster its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, better known as Transco, that transports fracked gas from the Texas Gulf Coast across about a dozen states. The Williams Companies calls its proposal the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, or the SSEP, a pipeline that will expand capacity for Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and other states.

A FERC decision is expected for Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is operated by EQT Corp., by the end of the year. FERC is expected to review the proposal by The Williams Companies, based in Oklahoma, by February.

The Williams Companies also recently submitted a separate proposal for a pipeline expansion in Virginia, a plan that emerged in May during a quarterly earnings call. The Williams Companies said it was aiming to run pipe from Southern Virginia to “serve the power-hungry Virginia market” with a northern extension, dubbed the Power Express, and later told the Cardinal News website that the project was “in the early development stage.”

The rush for more reliance on gas is likely to gain pace.

The Virginia Department of Energy announced just weeks ago a partnership with the Williams Companies as well as Red Post Energy LLC, whose parent company is based in Australia, and Enbridge Inc., headquartered in Canada. The initiative will study new natural gas infrastructure proposals for “locations between Roanoke and Bristol,” according to a department release on Oct. 9.

The study “will evaluate site suitability, environmental considerations, interconnection requirements, and economic benefits including job creation, tax revenue, and regional development opportunities,” the department said. The release offered no deadline for the study’s completion.

All these proposals would thread miles more natural gas pipeline in a state that is seen as a hot property for companies seeking data centers as part of their growth strategy.

Those proposals are being considered as Virginia oversees other new operations coming on line. TC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, is set this month to launch a pipeline, nearly 49 miles in length, near the Tidewater region. The Virginia Natural Gas local distribution company is also seeking by October 2027 to expand a compressor station in the city of Chesapeake, in southeastern Virginia, to boost smaller intrastate pipelines.

But some communities are raising concerns about the speed and breadth of many of these proposals—and they are complaining that towns and residents are having a difficult time sorting through the construction requests and possible risks.

Community advocates, in both states, said they want to know how regulators and towns are supposed to assess cumulative impacts and allow for proper public involvement in the process.

“How confusing and complicated,” Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator with Appalachian Voices, an environmental nonprofit advocacy group based in North Carolina, said about the pipeline proposals and FERC’s analysis of the projects.

Data center proposals, tied to artificial intelligence work sought by technology and financial companies, are changing the landscape of some swaths of rural America. Virginia alone could see electricity demands triple by 2040 because of data center growth. The state, home to several federal agencies, has been keen to accommodate business interests tied to AI.

The Virginia General Assembly’s policy research unit has estimated that a new 1.5 gigawatt gas plant, enough to power about 375,000 homes, would need to be built every 18 months for 15 consecutive years as part of the energy mix needed if all the data center proposals become reality.

The expansion of natural gas is among the priorities of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump is a proponent of fossil fuels and early in his second term he issued an executive order “Unleashing American Energy.” Trump declared a widely disputed national energy emergency, which some companies such as Mountain Valley Pipeline have used to support pipeline expansion proposals.

Mountain Valley spokesperson Shawn Day said the company’s main line, a 303-mile project running from Northwest West Virginia into Pittsylvania County completed in 2024, ensured reliability. Day pointed to an April 2025 report by FERC and the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability Corporation, another regulatory group, that “credited MVP with helping to avoid” gas shortages “during extreme weather and periods of record demand early this year.”

“Opponents of the MVP Mainline claimed for years that the (main line) project wasn’t needed, and yet barely six months after it entered operation, the project was operating at its full capacity, providing a critical supply of natural gas for residential and business use and electricity generation,” Day said in an email. The Southgate extension will prove to be as useful if not critical for the region, MVP contends in its proposal.

The Williams Companies also focused on rising needs in its application for expansion. In an email to Inside Climate News, it described the SSEP as a “$1.2 billion investment that will strengthen energy reliability and deliver meaningful economic benefits across the region.”

SSEP “will meet or exceed all safety and environmental standards, while supporting climate and energy goals,” the Williams Companies statement said. “Assertions to the contrary misrepresent both the facts and our record of responsible development.”

That is not how some community groups—critical of coal mining in the region and fearful of the rapid demand of pipelines across the countryside—view the energy companies’ ambitions and regard for local residents. They fear that the development will harm their way of life.

“It all comes down to there has not been any transparency, any real data showing a need for all of this coming through here,” said Tiffany Haworth, executive director of the nonprofit Dan River Basin Association, who also questioned whether all the data centers will be built. There is a risk that energy companies are predicting and producing for a market that may not exist—and communities may suffer, she said.

“People want to turn their lights on. … We get that. But we already have a pipeline going through there,” Haworth said. “We as an organization don’t feel that the harm that it is going to cause to our waterways and our recreational outdoor recreational economy—over a million people get their drinking water from these rivers—makes sense.”

Kasey Kinsella, associate director of 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous advocacy group that opposes the pipelines, said the companies’ plans, if completed, would destroy any chance of natural harmony.

“All of this is just so absurd,” Kinsella said.

Southgate in Virginia

Big energy companies and their related businesses have been eager to provide services in some of the fastest-growing states. Mountain Valley Pipeline and the Williams Companies have both focused on a North Carolina location—Rockingham County, population 91,000—as the choice for their expansion ambitions.

Mountain Valley Pipeline, operating in Virginia since 2014, first proposed the Southgate Extension in 2018 as a pipeline to extend from its main line, starting in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and running 31 miles deep into north central North Carolina. That extension was approved in 2020 by FERC—but on the condition that the main line received its necessary approvals.

The main line construction faced several legal disputes for nearly a decade. In 2023, MVP benefited from congressional pressure orchestrated by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin pushed its permit through during the federal budget process then. By June 2024, the main line was operating.

The Southgate proposal, too, has faced some trouble from regulators. The Virginia Air Pollution Control Board in 2021 reviewed and rejected MVP’s permit request for Southgate based on health concerns. The board found the pipeline path would cause potentially disproportionate harm to Black residential areas.

In late 2023, months after the main line approval, MVP revised its Southgate plan with some major changes.

MVP’s proposed new Southgate would traverse 31 miles rather than 75 miles–and ends at a different place. MVP’s previous Southgate proposal had terminated in Alamance County in North Carolina; the new plan will end in nearby Rockingham County.

FERC in 2024 released an environmental assessment, that the amended project “would result in fewer environmental effects than the” original MVP plan. It “would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” although there would be some impacts to prime farmland, forested areas and wetlands, FERC said.

FERC notably found that the Southgate proposal would not be likely to “adversely affect” federally endangered animals in the area, including the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat. The project, FERC also said, would “not result in significant effects,” on state-listed species, including the bigeye jumprock, which the Virginia Department of Wildlife has designated as having “high conservation need.”

FERC also found that MVP’s proposed method of horizontal directional drilling, or boring that goes under streams instead of digging ditches across them, would avoid environmental harm. Horizontal drilling “greatly reduces potential effects on surface waterbodies, particularly compared to open-cut crossings. In general, typical pipeline effects on waterbodies are avoided with trenchless methods,” FERC said in its 2024 assessment.

Williams Companies’s Plan

The Williams Companies’s SSEP is also proposed to run from Pittsylvania County in Virginia and end in Rockingham County. The Williams Companies aims to build two loops of pipeline–a 31-mile section crossing the Virginia and North Carolina border is called the “Eden Loop” and a 24.2-mile stretch in North Carolina is dubbed the “Salem Loop.” Both would link to its pipeline running from Texas.

In an environmental assessment report in 2024, FERC reviewed Williams Companies’s plan and found no “significant impact” to the “quality of human environment. The effect on “vegetation would be minor and mostly temporary to short term,” and “effects on wildlife from construction and operation of the Project would not be significant,” according to the FERC report.

FERC also assessed the cumulative impacts of both MVP’s Southgate and The Williams Companies’s SSEP proposal based on a myriad of aspects, including wetlands. MVP’s proposal would affect 18.2 acres of wetlands during construction, it said, and the Williams Companies’ Eden Loop would affect 27.5 acres of wetlands.

Because of the overlapping construction area and timetable of the projects, “cumulative effects on surface water quality may occur,” FERC said. It noted that “The magnitude of effects would depend on the specific timeframe of crossing the same waterbodies.”

Sims of Appalachian Voices said FERC did not go far enough in looking at the double whammy of two pipeline projects—with trucks, traffic and construction—converging on Rockingham County. “I’m not sure how anyone could look at that much information and come to that conclusion,” Sims said of FERC’s report.

Sims said having the two projects, which could be as close as within 200 feet of each other in some areas of the criss-crossing routes, could be problematic if there were structural failures in either network. She questioned how regulators would track which company was responsible for erosion and sediment problems that could choke flora and fauna.

“If you have projects that are so closely routed with construction at the same time, the blame–if there are sedimentation problems–it’s even more complicated,” Sims said.

Broader Community Concerns

Haworth of The Dan River Basin Association, based in North Carolina, said she and others are concerned that MVP’s and the Williams Companies’s projects will upend years of work to protect the environment and the river that flows through eight counties in Virginia and North Carolina.

The river basin, a 3,300 square mile watershed, is fed by the Smith, Mayo, Banister, Hayco and Sandy rivers. The waterways have weathered troubling industrial demands before, she said, and residents across state borders have some vivid memories of a time when textiles dominated the economic and environmental landscape.

The dye from a factory in Martinsville, Virginia, would flow into the Smith River and change the color of the stream ”running down all the way down into North Carolina,” Haworth said. In 2014, one of Duke Energy Corp.’s steam stations in Eden, North Carolina, sprung a leak, leading the U.S. Department of Interior to find that approximately 39,000 tons of ash and 27 million gallons of ash pond water” were released and resulted in a threat to endangered species and migratory birds.

“We’ve worked really hard for two decades, working with municipalities and state government, to make sure that these natural resources remain protected, preserved for future generations, and pipelines do not quite fit into that,” Haworth said.

Haworth wondered how FERC could find “no significant impact” on the quality of life for people who will live near miles of heavy construction. “When they say minimal impact, no amount of impact is worth hurting people. A million people’s drinking water,” she said.

Kinsella of the advocacy group 7 Directions of Service said she is concerned about every part of the expansion. No one should overlook, she said, the impact of compressors along the pipeline trail. They too will add noise and stress, she said, particularly so to neighborhoods that have historically been burdened with industrial pressures.

The energy companies may try to monetarily compensate the residents with onetime financial checks but that won’t really address how their lives will be changed, she said.

“What will the cost be when there are health impacts from an expanded compressor station?” Kinsella said. “My heart goes out to these working class folks along the main line route who, their land, their water, their livelihood, psychologically, has been just so beat up over the past 10 years in this fight.”

FERC is expected to make a decision on Southgate by the end of the year. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) also is undergoing a water protection permit process that will assess streams and wetland impacts. A public hearing for the permit is scheduled Thursday night and a decision is expected Dec. 8.

Melanie Davenport, director of DEQ’s cross-media programs, said the agency has requested erosion and sediment stormwater protection plans, which would prevent loose dirt from washing into waterways.

FERC is expected to decide SSEP by February. Virginia DEQ’s also is reviewing and will have to approve two water quality permits for the project.

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, which is also reviewing the proposals, recently approved a permit for Mountain Valley Pipeline for the Southgate Extension but the project cannot move forward without FERC approval.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1514932691-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 17:01:48.285577

“Robust investment in renewables and storage will be required to meet US demand growth in this timeframe.","With the US preparing for approximately 90 gigawatts (GW) of peak demand growth through 2030, gas and coal generation will only be able to meet about 37 GW of this growth, according to a new report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report, “Power Hungry: Why Gas and Coal Alone Won’t Keep Up with US Power Demand Growth” from Wood Mackenzie, meeting this demand growth through 2030 is the largest challenge faced by the US power sector.

“If more plant retirements are delayed, the value could rise to 67 GW, but significant uncertainty surrounds how many more retirements will be deferred,” Patrick Huang, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “90 GW of demand growth is well below the 160 GW of US utilities’ large load commitments tracked by Wood Mackenzie, as supply dictates how much demand growth can materialize.”

Huang added that if coal and gas plants ramp up utilization, the existing thermal fleet could meet up to 47 GW of peak demand growth. This is less than 30% of the large load commitments made by US utilities and will be offset by 98 GW of planned coal and gas retirements (59 GW of peak load contribution lost) through 2030. Further retirement deferrals could keep 50 GW (30 GW of peak load contribution) online past 2030, but even in this scenario coal and gas generation falls short of meeting total demand growth. Since keeping old coal and gas units online for longer is expensive and can run against state priorities, delaying retirements for a large portion of the existing fleet will be challenging.

The report notes that manufacturing bottlenecks are a key constraint on new thermal capacity. Gas turbine orders currently face extended lead times, with new gas plant additions limited to 58 GW (49 GW of peak load contribution) between 2025 and the end of 2030. Furthermore, the rising cost of gas turbines will make these additions very expensive in comparison to current wholesale electricity prices. Our analysis shows that renewables need to play a key role in making demand growth in the US more affordable.

“While gas and coal generation will play a large role in enabling strong load growth, it’s clear that the existing thermal fleet cannot meet this new demand alone,” said Huang. “Robust investment in renewables and storage will be required to meet US demand growth in this timeframe. Also, given that solar only shines during the day and economic long-duration energy storage is not widely available, wind generation needs to be a key part of meeting demand growth.”","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/gas/macro-gas/macro_gas_gettyimages-724285883.jpg?width=800&height=480&rmode=crop&rxy=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-11-20 17:01:15.411449

The NC State Agrivoltaics Training Site is the first of its kind in the Southeast, where students and solar professionals can learn practices in agrivoltaics and the installation of solar technology that enables installation on steep terrain through Nevados’ proprietary tracker technology. Agrivoltaics is the co-location of solar panels and agricultural activities — including food and livestock production — on the same land.

“This new solar training site is a testament to the power of partnership,” said Chris Frey, associate dean for research & infrastructure at the College of Engineering. “It is an amazing interdisciplinary collaboration between NC State’s Clean Energy Technology Center, the Department of Animal Science and Nevados, a manufacturer of solar tracking systems. And it positions NC State as a continuing leader in energy and agricultural education for students and professionals throughout their careers.”

Yesterday’s launch included a preview of the university’s new agrivoltaics training, Agrivoltaics in Action: Enhancing Operations and Maintenance in Livestock-Integrated Solar Sites. This course, which will launch in Spring 2026, equips solar professionals with essential skills for navigating grazed solar sites, including working with electric fencing, guardian animals and sheep-based vegetation management, while offering strategies to streamline operations and maintenance and foster collaboration between solar operators and grazing professionals.

“Grazing sheep on solar farms offers a multitude of benefits for the solar and sheep industry,” said Dr. Andrew Weaver, Assistant Professor of Animal Science. “These benefits include reduced mowing needs and more cost effective vegetation management, farmland preservation, improved public perception, and career opportunities for local sheep producers. The NC State Agrivoltaics Training Site will provide an invaluable opportunity to train our students and farmers in the best management practices for solar grazing. This training site isn’t just about solar energy; it’s about pioneering the future of sheep production – a future that is more resilient, productive, and profitable for North Carolina and the world.”

The training site, including three rows of Nevados’ TRACE All Terrain Tracker system and three types of solar modules, will be used for agrivoltaics education, especially solar grazing, and solar technician training through the NC Clean Energy Technology Center, Nevados and the Department of Animal Science

When electricity users match their usage with new, near, and now clean electricity, the energy grid becomes more efficient, and savings can be passed along to consumers.","WASHINGTON – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-9) today introduced the Clean Cloud Act, legislation to establish emission standards for electricity used by high-demand energy users such as cryptominers and data centers. The measure has seven original cosponsors. The companion bill was introduced by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), and Senator John Fetterman (D-PA).

Congressman Cohen made the following statement:

“The rapid growth of cryptominers and data centers is straining our energy grid and outpacing the growth of carbon-free electricity. Utilities are raising consumer electricity rates and relying increasingly on gas and coal generation to meet this load growth. In some instances, retired coal plants have even been brought back online to power cryptomining facilities. Even in markets with solar or wind, data centers often run 24/7 and require either long-duration storage or clean firm generation to be truly carbon neutral.

“Memphis already hosts significant data-center and data-processing operations, and more companies are looking to the Mid-South because of our strategic location. But Memphis is one of the most energy-burdened cities in America where families spend a larger share of their income on utilities than almost anywhere in the country. We cannot allow high-demand industries to increase pressure on the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) system or lead to higher bills for Memphis households.

“The Clean Cloud Act ensures that as data-center development inevitably grows, it’s powered responsibly, supported by new zero-carbon generation, and doesn’t leave communities like ours footing the bill.”

The bill also:

• Requires an annual, published survey of cryptominers and data centers

• Establishes an emissions intensity baseline

• Incentivizes new clean power development

• Supports energy affordability programs for residential consumers

• Invests in zero-carbon electricity and battery storage

The Clean Cloud Act is endorsed by the following organizations: EnergyTag, Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA), Public Citizen, Southern Environmental Law Center, and Center for Biological Diversity

Endorsement statements:

“The US is experiencing significant demand growth driven, in part, by data center buildout and rapidly increasing electricity consumption. The Clean Cloud Act asks the largest energy users to take responsibility for their impacts by matching their electricity consumption with new clean electricity matched to the hour when and the location where they operate. When electricity users match their usage with new, near, and now clean electricity, the energy grid becomes more efficient, and savings can be passed along to consumers. The solutions outlined in this bill will help ensure that industrial growth does not exacerbate the affordability crisis we see today and drives around the clock clean energy forward,” said Alex Piper, Head of US Policy and Markets at EnergyTag. “EnergyTag applauds Congressman Cohen for his leadership here. Clean, affordable growth is necessary and possible, and this bill sets the foundation.”

“This is a meaningful step toward finally reining in pollution from the high-emitting AI and cryptomining industries. The commonsense measures in the Clean Cloud Act will cut carbon emissions and prevent these sectors from deepening the climate crisis and putting communities at risk,” said Camden Weber, climate and energy policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Rep. Cohen’s bill is a smart, much-needed move to bring oversight to these industries, which have operated without safeguards.”

“We fully support the goals behind the Clean Cloud Act, especially the opportunity to build additional power generation, increase electric grid stability and grow energy industry jobs,” said Utility Workers Union of America President James Slevin. “We anticipate electricity demand on the grid continuing to grow exponentially over the coming years and we appreciate Congressman Cohen’s continued advocacy on this important issue.”

The findings are from a new report by Environmental Defense Fund and Atlas Public Policy.

“These cancelled clean energy manufacturing projects will cause financial hardships for communities across the country, many of which saw investment for the first time in a generation,” said Ellen Robo, Senior Manager for Clean Air Policy and Analytics at Environmental Defense Fund. “Turning away from clean, affordable, made-in-America technologies will mean our country has fewer manufacturing jobs, dirtier and more expensive energy systems, and reduced competitiveness. Our economy and our planet cannot afford for us to make this mistake.”

U.S. clean energy manufacturing saw historic growth from 2021 through 2024 but crashed this year in the face of hostile policies from the Trump administration. According to the report, in spite of billions in announced new investments and some months of positive growth, clean energy manufacturing investments overall are still significantly lower this year compared to this point in 2024.

From 2021 to 2024, companies announced more than $220 billion in investments in clean energy manufacturing projects across the U.S. However, policy shifts and funding cuts under the Trump administration have led to cancellations of almost $25 billion of those investments so far in 2025, with a loss of more than 34,000 anticipated jobs. In October, $3.9 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects were canceled and 6,700 anticipated jobs were lost. Those numbers are slightly offset by some new investments, but overall investment are still down by billions.

Six of the last 10 months have seen negative overall investment, meaning new investments were overwhelmed by cancellations.

By clarifying which waters are jurisdictional, this rule offers a more predictable permitting process, reducing administrative burdens and supporting housing production and affordability.","In a move championed by NAHB, the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have announced a proposed updated definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) that would provide builders much-needed clarity by defining which waters are subject to federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act while continuing to protect our nation’s vital waterways. The proposed rule was published on Nov. 20 in the Federal Register for a 45-day comment period.

The proposed rule:

Limits federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act to traditional navigable waters and the relatively permanent waters that flow from them, such as year-round or seasonally flowing lakes, streams and rivers, and wetlands that directly abut those waters,

Defines key terms including “relatively permanent” and “continuous surface connection,”

Removes interstate waters as a separate jurisdictional category, and

Reaffirms exclusions for most ditches, prior-converted cropland and waste treatment systems.

This rule corrects the overreach of the 2023 conforming rule, which had broadly interpreted “relatively permanent” and allowed wetlands connected by swales, pipes or man-made drainage to be considered jurisdictional.

A March 2025 EPA and Corps guidance clarified that only wetlands physically abutting a jurisdictional water, without intervening upland, berm or dike, meet the continuous surface connection test. This change aligns federal jurisdiction more closely with the Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA and Rapanos v. United States decisions.

For home builders, the proposed rule provides greater regulatory certainty. Unclear jurisdictional boundaries have long caused project delays, added costs, and unpredictable permitting. Further, in states that regulate beyond the federal definition of WOTUS, vague federal requirements have caused confusion regarding the permitting authority for dredge and fill projects.

Massachusetts isn’t going to gut its landmark climate law—yet.

The state House of Representatives appeared this week to be speeding toward passage of H4744, a bill that would revise some of the programs and policies behind the state’s requirement to halve its emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels.

But on Tuesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz, a Democrat, said members needed more time to review the bill’s many moving parts. This likely kicks any action into 2026 because lawmakers were to conclude their regular business for the year on Wednesday.

Climate and clean energy advocates expressed relief. They had organized in the few days since the legislation surfaced on Nov. 13 and were lobbying to either kill the bill or add amendments to weaken it.

If the bill had passed in anything resembling its current form, Massachusetts—a national leader on climate policy—would have strengthened the idea that 2025 is a year of fading climate ambitions in the states. Arizona, Connecticut, New York and North Carolina are among the states that have reduced their climate goals or taken other actions that make achieving emissions reductions harder. (I’ll get to specifics in the other states in a moment.)

“We will survive the Trump administration, but we can’t survive having states like Massachusetts bail,” said Larry Chretien, executive director at Green Energy Consumers Alliance, an advocacy group that covers Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

Chretien viewed many parts of the bill as harmful, including a provision that would reduce funding for the Mass Save energy efficiency program by $500 million. He is hopeful that Gov. Maura Healey and the leaders of the House and Senate, all Democrats, can work together in the coming months to find ways to make energy more affordable while maintaining the state’s climate and clean energy policy trajectory.

But the political and economic factors that led to the bill remain. The main sponsor, Rep. Mark Cusack, a Democrat and chair of the committee that oversees energy policy, said the bill was a response to concerns about energy affordability.

Democrats in Massachusetts and across the country want to run in next year’s mid-term elections as the party of affordability and they want to tie Republicans to soaring electricity rates and rising costs of other essentials.

It’s easy for Republicans to blame high electricity costs on the transition away from fossil fuels. This is even though some of the cost concerns are tied to the Trump administration’s budget cuts and the cancellation of grants that helped fund state-level programs.

The complexity of the subject doesn’t lend itself to campaign messages. Power bills are surging due to rising electricity demand from data centers and other large users, increasing natural gas prices and other factors, including spending to support climate and clean energy policies. The significance of each factor varies by state and utility.

Here’s some of what’s happened in other states:

Arizona: The Arizona Corporation Commission is in the process of repealing the state’s requirement, adopted in 2006, that utilities get 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. On Aug. 14, the commission voted unanimously to direct its staff to continue with the repeal. Commission Chair Kevin Thompson, a Republican, said in a statement that renewable energy technology “should be able to prevail on its own without the need for mandates that have added millions of dollars in extra costs for ratepayers each year.” One wrinkle in this discussion is that Arizona utilities already have met the standard. The debate is mostly about whether it makes sense to have a standard at all, with environmental advocates arguing that a repeal sends the wrong message about the state’s long-term direction.

Connecticut: On July 1, Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, signed Senate Bill 4, which reduces the state’s targets for its renewable portfolio standard and also allows for wood-burning and other biomass to count toward meeting the standard. The new renewable standard for 2030 requires utilities to get 29 percent of their electricity from renewable sources, down from 40 percent before this change. Lamont said in a statement that “electric bills are too damn high” and described the bill as a first step in addressing a complex issue.

New York: Unlike other states that are backsliding on climate, New York’s shift has been through a series of small actions rather than a single bill or regulatory order. These actions have left climate and clean energy advocates feeling that Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, is willing to undermine prior laws and rules that have made the state a leader in climate policy. One example is the Northeast Supply Enhancement gas pipeline, which had been stalled but now appears to be proceeding toward construction, as my colleague Lauren Dalban reported.

North Carolina: In July, the Republican-controlled legislature overrode the veto of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, of a bill that cancels Duke Energy’s carbon reduction target of 70 percent by 2030 compared to 2005. The bill, which sponsors called “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” has now become law, undoing a key part of a state climate law adopted in 2021, as my colleague Lisa Sorg reported.

Reviewing these examples from states underscores how important Massachusetts is for shaping the national narrative. States tend to follow one another, and certain states, including Massachusetts, play an outsize role because of their history of leadership.

If Massachusetts joins the other states in backsliding, it’s easy to imagine someone in a committee room in, say, Michigan, pointing to Massachusetts and saying it’s long past time for Michigan to follow suit.

Note that I didn’t list Pennsylvania among the states retreating. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, reached a budget deal with Republicans in the legislature that says the state will not join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But, as ICN’s Pennsylvania reporter, Kiley Bense, reminded me this week, the budget deal isn’t exactly backsliding: The state has never participated in the regional coalition and is not a leader on climate policy.

I don’t want to focus exclusively on states moving backward.

Illinois is an example of a state moving forward with the passage this month of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, which expands energy conservation and seeks to increase development of battery energy storage, among many other provisions.

But Illinois is the exception, according to Autumn Proudlove, managing director for policy and markets for the NC Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University.

“We’ve definitely seen a new trend of states considering legislation that would delay clean energy targets and commitments or remove interim targets,” she said.

Interim targets are important. If a state says it’s going to reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050, that goal is much more meaningful if there are requirements to meet benchmarks along the way. Failure to meet interim targets can be a wake-up call that policies aren’t working and that lawmakers need to do more.

Or, in this political moment, failure or impending failure to meet interim targets can be an excuse to get rid of them or weaken them. So, Massachusetts, what’s it going to be?",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/american-public-power-association-XGAZzyLzn18-unsplash-scaled-2-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 16:02:21.300991

Today’s agreement between the EPA, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Environmental Health was approved in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
The agreement and the 2025 lawsuit it resolves are part of an ongoing effort to compel the EPA to protect people and the environment from air pollution, including ozone pollution, in compliance with the Clean Air Act.","OAKLAND, Calif.— A federal judge approved a legal agreement today requiring the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to act on smog pollution in the Phoenix-Mesa metro area by Feb. 3, 2026.

But the agency has proposed excusing Phoenix from taking any action to clean up the dangerous pollution under a rarely used provision of the Clean Air Act that allows exemptions based on emissions from abroad.

The EPA must now give the public an opportunity to comment on the proposal.

“It’s outrageous that the Trump EPA wants to use international emissions as an excuse to do nothing instead of reducing the dangerous smog Phoenix residents are forced to breathe every day,” said Benjamin Rankin, an associate attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “People in the Phoenix metro area can push back and demand that the Trump administration act aggressively and urgently to reduce unhealthy pollution rather than pander to the polluters causing it.”

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set “national ambient air quality standards” for pollutants such as ozone, commonly known as smog. The EPA set air standards for ozone in 2015, but a decade later it is failing to ensure that Phoenix is reducing ozone pollution to healthy levels.

People exposed to excess ozone are at risk of reduced lung function and increased respiratory problems like asthma, suffering more emergency room visits and premature deaths. Around 4 million people in the Phoenix area are being chronically exposed to ozone pollution caused by industrial and vehicle emissions and extreme heat.

Ozone also causes widespread environmental harms by stunting tree growth, damaging leaves and increasing plants’ susceptibility to disease, insect damage and harsh weather.

“It’s high time that the Trump administration took action to protect people from disease-causing ozone pollution, especially children and the elderly, who are most vulnerable,” said Shakoora Azimi-Gaylon, senior director of toxic exposures and pollution prevention at the Center for Environmental Health. “It’d be a shame if the EPA only stops sitting on its hands just to let Phoenix off the hook for its ozone problem. We must continue to fight for clean air for the millions of people living in Phoenix.”

An EPA study found that Clean Air Act programs to reduce fine particle and ozone pollution prevented more than 230,000 deaths, 200,000 heart attacks, and 2.4 million asthma attacks in 2020 alone. For each dollar spent, Americans have received more than $30 of health benefits in return.

While protecting the health of Americans, the Clean Air Act has also helped to keep the U.S. economy healthy by creating jobs, with an estimated 1.6 million Americans employed in the environmental technology industry helping to keep our air clean.

“This pollution harms people in the worst ways possible,” said Tom Fox, senior legislative counsel at the Center for Environmental Health.","OAKLAND, Calif.— The Center for Biological Diversity and Center for Environmental Health filed a lawsuit today challenging the Trump Environmental Protection Agency’s failure to protect millions of California and Colorado residents from dangerous smog pollution.

“Trump’s EPA is forcing millions of people to breathe extremely harmful levels of smog, day after day,” said Ryan Maher, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “As this administration gives handout after handout to the fossil fuel industry and other polluters, we’re counting on the courts to step in and protect public health.”

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards to protect people and the environment from pollutants like smog. When those standards are violated, the agency must ensure that states have valid plans in place to clean up the pollution.

The Denver metro area and the West Mojave Desert regions at issue in the lawsuit are home to more than 4 million people. Both regions suffer from air quality that does not meet federal standards for dangerous ozone pollution, commonly referred to as smog.

Ozone exposure has severe impacts on people, plants, and animals. Ozone pollution is particularly harmful to children and the elderly, causing asthma and reduced lung function. In the Denver metro area alone, more than 750,000 children and nearly 550,000 elderly people are put at risk by unsafe ozone levels, according to the American Lung Association.

Ozone also stunts the growth of trees and increases their susceptibility to disease, insect damage, and harsh weather. Unchecked levels of harmful air pollution threaten many much-loved spaces in the Western Mojave Desert, including Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and the Mojave Trails National Monument.

“This pollution harms people in the worst ways possible,” said Tom Fox, senior legislative counsel at the Center for Environmental Health. “It’s imperative that Trump’s EPA uphold its duty to protect the public’s health by acting immediately, as the law requires.”

A variety of sources contribute to smog, including the fossil fuel industry and vehicle emissions. In the Denver metro area, for example, nearly half of the emissions causing smog arise from the production of dirty fossil fuels.

In the Western Mojave, the EPA’s failure to regulate local air quality is part of the Trump administration’s broader push to prioritize corporate profit over its lawful conservation duties. Earlier this year the president unlawfully approved mining in the Mojave National Preserve and, during the government shutdown, the Department of the Interior targeted Joshua Tree National Park for cuts to conservation and education resources.

In fact, in many states like North Dakota, it’s part of our identity - and a vital part of keeping the lights on.
It happened not because anyone “targeted” coal - it’s because markets evolve, technologies advance, and consumers benefit when energy stays affordable.
I understand the frustration - coal communities deserve support and respect, and we all want American energy to stay strong.
Heidi Heitkamp is a Former North Dakota Senator (2013-2019).","In 2019, the United States became a net energy exporter for the first time in over 60 years – a position our country has maintained since. This milestone wasn’t accidental; it was the result of hard work, innovation, and an energy strategy that let all sources, including oil, gas, coal, and renewables, compete on a fair playing field.

During my time in the Senate, I supported efforts to prevent government mandates that tip the scales effectively, picking winners and losers. I believe markets, not mandates, do the best job of delivering affordable, reliable energy to American families. Free markets are the most capable tool for driving solutions that benefit consumers and tackle our country’s biggest challenges – not Washington bureaucrats. Whether it’s coal in North Dakota or solar in Arizona, every energy source deserves a fair chance to compete and succeed on its merit, and I opposed regulatory frameworks that sought to tip the scales against fossil fuels, instead favoring subsidized “green” alternatives.

My work in energy policy and willingness to cross party lines caught the attention of President Trump, who asked me to switch parties and even considered me for a Cabinet position. I appreciated President Trump’s focus on American energy independence, and we shared a belief that our nation should use every tool in the toolbox to power our economy and create good jobs.

That’s why I was surprised to see the administration lend its support to an antitrust lawsuit that seems at odds with that same market-driven approach we’ve both championed.

Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with eleven other states, filed an antitrust lawsuit against three large asset managers: BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard. In May, the Trump Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case.

The lawsuit alleges that these firms conspired to influence coal companies by using their investments to promote environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, ultimately reducing production and raising costs. It’s fair to ask how large investors are shaping corporate priorities - but from what I’ve seen, the evidence doesn’t back up the idea of a coordinated effort to limit coal production.

The asset managers held relatively modest stakes in these coal companies and often voted in line with management, including efforts to expand production. In fact, coal output actually rose during the period in question - another reminder that markets, not backroom deals, tend to drive energy outcomes.

We should be careful that efforts to hold Wall Street accountable don’t cross into territory that chills investment or injects politics into the marketplace. Many of the actions cited, such as joining climate-related investor coalitions, are common among firms seeking to respond to shifting market trends and regulatory landscapes. That doesn’t necessarily imply bad faith or collusion.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent, bipartisan body, looked at these same issues and found no undue influence. FERC ultimately concluded there was no evidence these firms exerted undue control over corporate decision-making. That should give us pause before turning normal market activity into a federal case.

The broader concern is the potential chilling effect on energy investment. This case, if successful, could lead to divestment from coal companies amounting to nearly $18 billion. The last thing we need is uncertainty that scares off investors or limits capital for the very industries we want to strengthen.

Coal has always played a significant role in America’s energy mix. In fact, in many states like North Dakota, it’s part of our identity - and a vital part of keeping the lights on. But the unfortunate reality is that shift occurred in the marketplace. It happened not because anyone “targeted” coal - it’s because markets evolve, technologies advance, and consumers benefit when energy stays affordable. Litigation isn’t likely to reverse that trend and may only introduce more uncertainty into an already volatile sector.

I understand the frustration - coal communities deserve support and respect, and we all want American energy to stay strong. But the best way to do that is by keeping our approach grounded in competition, innovation, and common sense. That’s how we keep energy made in America - and make sure every community, from coal country to the coasts, shares that success.

Stay Grounded in Your Health – and Your Finances Rising health care costs can feel overwhelming, but knowledge and planning go a long way.","(Family Features) Homeowners still have time to take advantage of a federal tax credit of up to 30% of the cost of eligible energy-efficient home improvements. The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (also known as the 25C tax credit) can help offset the expense of updating or upgrading major home systems while also lowering energy consumption.

Understanding the 25C Tax Credit

Homeowners in the United States may be eligible when they install qualifying energy-efficient equipment in their primary residence such as all-climate electric heat pumps, insulation, windows and other improvements. The credit is subject to some limitations; for example, a homeowner can only claim up to $2,000 per year for a heat pump. The installation must be an addition or improvement to an existing home, not a new home, and can be used in combination with other tax credits or incentives such as local, utility and federal incentives and IRA programs.

The current version of this tax credit was implemented Jan. 1, 2023, and expires Dec. 31, 2025. In addition, rising energy costs and potential regulatory changes in 2026, such as updated guidelines on refrigerant, make late 2025 a strategic time to upgrade systems.

Smart Ways to Use the Tax Credit

Generally, energy-saving upgrades are some of the most common home improvement projects because they enhance the home’s overall function while increasing the potential for cost savings on energy bills.

Some qualifying upgrades do double-duty by enhancing the home’s curb appeal while reducing energy requirements. Common examples include windows, skylights and exterior doors.

Insulation and air sealing materials such as caulk and weatherstripping are also common choices, especially in older homes where insulation may be below current standards and settling has created gaps for air leaks.

Another common selection for homeowners looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit is climate control systems, and an increasing number are turning to all-climate, all-electric heat pumps. One major reason is their high performance when it comes to energy efficiency. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, today’s heat pumps can reduce electricity use for heating by 65% compared to electric resistance heating. In fact, Mitsubishi Electric all-climate, all-electric heat pumps have an efficiency rating at 260-490% compared to traditional systems at or below 100%.

In addition to their proven track record, contrary to a popular misconception that all-climate heat pumps are only for milder regions, the systems can operate quite effectively in both high heat and extreme cold. As a result, they provide homeowners with greater comfort and control of their indoor climate.

Take Steps to Beat the Deadline

If you’re a homeowner planning to make upgrades and claim 25C tax credits, now is the ideal time to get your project underway.

Choose qualifying equipment. While some brands’ complete product lines meet the qualification criteria, others do not. Do your homework to ensure the model you’re installing is eligible for the credit. Your salesperson may be able to provide information, or you can visit the manufacturer website or contact the manufacturer directly for details.

Work with a certified contractor. Many reputable brands, including Mitsubishi Electric, offer a contractor network with highly skilled, knowledgeable and reputable installers.

Save your receipts to file. When you prepare your 2025 tax forms, you’ll need to complete IRS Form 5695. Specifically, you will need to provide the manufacturer’s pin number and other details about your purchase, including proof of purchase.

(Family Features) Heart health is about more than just the heart itself. It’s a two-way street between the heart and the rest of the body. However, many U.S. adults aren’t aware of the connection between organs.

According to a survey conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Heart Association, 42% of U.S. adults do not understand how the heart can be impacted by other organ systems.

Health issues in other organ systems, like the kidneys or metabolic system – which includes how the body manages weight and blood glucose – can lead to heart trouble.

The close relationship between heart health, kidney health and metabolic health is known as cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health, or CKM health, and it is the focus of an American Heart Association initiative to raise awareness of how the systems function together. When one system is affected, it can make the others worse – creating a condition called CKM syndrome.

Close to 9 in 10 U.S. adults have at least one component of CKM syndrome, according to a study in the “Journal of the American Medical Association.” Components include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol or other lipids, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function. The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone.

The survey also found that while only 12% of U.S. adults have heard of CKM health or CKM syndrome, 72% said they’re interested in learning more and 79% agreed that it is important that they understand more about CKM health.

“What we want people to know is it’s really common to have heart disease, diabetes or metabolic disease and reduced kidney function at the same time,” said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association’s chief medical officer for prevention. “It’s reassuring to hear that once the CKM connection was defined around three-quarters of respondents understood that it was important and wanted to learn more.”

Highlighting the two-way street of the heart-body connection, the “2 Truths and No Lie” video offers a simplified visual:

The heart pumps blood to the body.

The metabolic system turns glucose (sugar) in the blood into energy.

The process of metabolism dumps waste back into the blood.

The kidneys filter waste from the blood and balance fluids, which helps with blood pressure.

Blood pressure affects how the heart pumps blood to the body.

While providing resources to help people understand how heart, kidney and metabolic health are connected, the American Heart Association’s CKM Health Initiative is also working with health care teams across the country to improve collaboration among health care professionals who care for patients living with multiple health conditions. Better awareness and improved screening can help people take action early to prevent a heart attack, heart failure or stroke.

The initiative is made possible by founding sponsors Novo Nordisk and Boehringer Ingelheim, supporting sponsors Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Bayer, and champion sponsor DaVita.

A health care insider shares tips for staying well and financially grounded, even in a tough economy

(Family Features) As the cost of living continues to rise, many Americans are being forced to make difficult financial decisions – weighing whether to pay rent, get groceries or fill prescriptions. Skipping medications might seem like a quick way to save money, but this can lead to serious health risks and even higher costs down the road.

In fact, research shows 27% of Americans skip prescriptions each month due to cost. More than half of Americans who filled a prescription this year said the cost felt like a financial burden, with 1 in 3 people cutting back on essentials like food or clothing to afford their medications.

These trade-offs highlight just how important it is to find practical, affordable ways to stay on treatment. Fortunately, there are proven strategies to help individuals stay current with their medications without breaking the bank. Cindy George, MPH, a senior personal finance editor at GoodRx and nationally recognized health journalist, shared expert advice to help consumers and their families improve their health care cost literacy, reduce expenses and stay healthy without overspending.

Understand the True Cost of Medications

Many people assume the pharmacy counter price is non-negotiable, but in reality, the cost of the same medication can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy or use of available savings tools.

“Many people don’t realize there is no single price for a prescription,” George said. “Costs can vary by upwards of $100 from one pharmacy to the next, even in the same ZIP code. Understanding how to compare prices and find the most affordable option is incredibly valuable. Just like travel sites show you different options for airlines or hotels and their associated expenses, prescription price comparison sites show how much your medication costs at each pharmacy and provide you with available savings.”

By entering the medication name, along with dosage and ZIP code, individuals can quickly compare prices in their area using GoodRx. Using the website or app, you can explore alternative forms of a medication and get suggestions to help you talk with your doctor or pharmacist about more affordable options.

When Insurance Falls Short, You Still Have Options

Today, only about half of all prescriptions are fully covered by insurance without restrictions. Many have conditions, such as step therapy, quantity limits or prior authorizations, that can lead to delays or higher costs at the pharmacy counter.

“Even insured individuals are struggling to keep up with health care costs,” George said. “More and more are finding themselves underinsured, and that’s making basic health care harder to afford – and harder to access – for millions of families.”

That’s why comparison shopping is increasingly important for people in the U.S. Even those with Medicare or Medicaid may benefit from cost comparisons. For that reason, George said it’s smart to look at all your options, including price comparisons at different pharmacies.

“Cost comparison tools can help people find lower prices on both generic and brand-name medications, regardless of their coverage status,” she said.

While these resources are not a full replacement for health insurance, they can be a helpful way to reduce medication costs and avoid unexpected surprises at the pharmacy.

Build Confidence Through Cost Literacy

Cost literacy is about more than just looking up prices. It involves understanding how insurance works, what’s included in a plan’s formulary, how to interpret billing documents and how to challenge costs that seem too high. According to George, “health care cost literacy” is one of the best investments you can make in your overall financial well-being.

“Improving your health care cost literacy starts with being aware of your options and asking the right questions,” she said. “Learn the basics, like what a premium, deductible or copay means, and review your insurance plan’s benefits and covered medications.”

George recommends starting with trusted tools that break down health care costs and terminology.

“Tools like the GoodRx Guide to Drug Costs, Coverage and Savings, cost estimators from hospitals and insurance plans and State Health Insurance Assistance Programs – known as SHIPs – for Medicare can help you better understand and manage costs,” she said. “If something is unclear, don’t hesitate to ask your provider, pharmacist or insurance representative to walk you through your bills or Explanation of Benefits.”

Simple Strategies Can Add Up

Small adjustments in how medications are filled can make a major difference over time. George recommends a few consistent strategies that can reduce out-of-pocket costs:

Always compare prices, including your insurance copay. “People assume their insurance copay is the best deal for accessing a medication at the lowest cost, but that’s not always true,” George said. “It’s important to compare prices upfront to ensure you’re taking the most affordable option.”

Uncover brand-name savings programs. Many pharmaceutical companies offer copay cards or patient assistance programs that can dramatically reduce your costs for brand-name or specialty medications.

Explore generic medications, if available. Generic medications typically cost less than their brand-name counterparts. Check with a health care professional before opting for a generic, because there might be specific reasons the brand-name version was prescribed.

Consider a 90-day supply. For chronic conditions, ask a health care professional whether you can switch from a 30-day supply of medication to a 90-day supply, since this is often cheaper per dose.

Try delivery. Ordering through a mail-order pharmacy can add convenience and, in many cases, offer lower prices, particularly for ongoing prescriptions.

Stay Grounded in Your Health – and Your Finances

Rising health care costs can feel overwhelming, but knowledge and planning go a long way. By building confidence through cost literacy, comparing prices and using tools to explore savings opportunities, consumers can remain in control of both their care and their budgets.

The Los Angeles Times reported national EV sales in July jumped 19% compared with a year earlier.
In addition, she noted that the used EV market will be getting a boost from cars coming off short-term leases of past couple years.
More than 50% of EVs are leased; historically, EVs coming off lease have substantially reduced prices.
In addition, 74% of current EV owners said they intended to buy an EV for their next vehicle.","From the headlines you might think the EV era was over. The early withdrawals of the $7,500 federal tax credit has been painted as the demise of the battery electric car industry. Sales are predicted to plummet, models are being delayed or canceled and auto companies are reviving internal combustion engine models and hybrids.

But those headlines don’t tell the whole story.

First, there was an incredible rush to buy EVs prior to the end of the $7,500 tax credit, which illustrates the appeal of electric cars. Cox Automotive said 438,000 EVs were sold in the third quarter of the year, taking 10.4% of the automotive market for the first time. EVs also have been cited as the main reason for a boost of overall car sales over the past several months. The Los Angeles Times reported national EV sales in July jumped 19% compared with a year earlier. In Southern California’s conservative Orange County, 32% of all new vehicles sold were electric. The market leader in EVs, Tesla, set an all-time sales record in the third quarter of 2025.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, told me there are several reasons to believe any drop-off in EV sales may be short-lived for several reasons.

More affordable EVs coming

Electric cars are more expensive than gasoline-powered models, averaging more than $9,000 than comparable gas models. Stephanie said new models coming online shortly may help close that gap, including the reduced price Tesla Model 3 and Model Y and the new Chevy Bolt, which will sell for less than $30,000.

The redesigned Nissan Leaf also just hit the market at $30,000. Other low-cost models are coming. In addition, she noted that the used EV market will be getting a boost from cars coming off short-term leases of past couple years. More than 50% of EVs are leased; historically, EVs coming off lease have substantially reduced prices. Those models could provide an additional incentive-free boost.

Stephanie also said market research by Cox showed 65% of buyers interested in EVs still planned to buy even without the federal tax credit. In addition, 74% of current EV owners said they intended to buy an EV for their next vehicle.

For current models and new ones coming, Stephanie added that advances in batteries could enhance performance while reducing costs.

More market incentives

Along with new, lower-cost models, automakers are reacting as they would to any market shift. Hyundai dropped the price of its best-selling EV, the Ioniq 5, by up to $10,000. Lucid said it would continue to honor a $7,500 discount for its new Gravity SUV. GM and Ford have suggested they may have a workaround to maintain low-cost leases for EVs.

Even as automakers shift their immediate market strategies, anyone playing in the world market (which is all of them) will need to keep active in EVs. China and Europe are both continuing to move toward full electrification, so long-term competitiveness dictates that the EVs will keep getting better.

The EV future still looks quite bright.

“The domestic market is hungry for sustainable, high-quality recycled aluminum,” said Michael Siemer, Sortera’s CEO.
“For them to be green, they each are going to need an additional billion pounds of scrap aluminum,” Siemer estimated.
Magnets can easily pull out pieces of steel from scrap piles, but aluminum alloys are tricky to sort.
That leaves behind roughly 18 billion pounds of mixed-metal material per year, about 10 billion of which include aluminum alloys, according to Sortera.","The startup Sortera Technologies has raised fresh funding to expand its tech-driven recycling operations — with an eye toward meeting rising U.S. demand for low-carbon aluminum.

Sortera uses advanced sensors and artificial intelligence to sort different types of aluminum found in old car parts and appliances. On Thursday, the company said it raised $45 million to fuel its next phase of growth, including from global investment firm T. Rowe Price Associates, venture capital fund VXI Capital, and Yamaha Motor Ventures, an arm of the Japanese manufacturer.

Sortera’s flagship facility in Markle, Indiana, currently processes about 100 million pounds of shredded metal per year to recover specific alloys — blends of aluminum that contain other elements to make them stronger and more durable. With the new investment, the startup plans to build a second plant next year, in Lebanon, Tennessee, to double its capacity to pick through gleaming scrap heaps.

The expansion comes as the United States is racing to shore up supplies of aluminum.

Part of that is driven by the Trump administration’s increased tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel, which have put pressure on U.S. manufacturers to produce more metal. Automakers are also using more lightweight aluminum instead of steel, including in battery-powered cars and hulking Ford F-150 pickup trucks. Data-center developers need more of the metal for their buildings and the technology inside, while some buyers are looking specifically for lower-carbon aluminum to meet decarbonization goals.

The U.S. is now playing catch-up. America’s production of new, primary aluminum has declined significantly in recent decades, and while plans are underway to build two new smelters, neither is expected to be fully on line this decade. Both projects will also need to secure huge amounts of cheap — and ideally clean — electricity at a time when that’s hard to come by.

Recycling aluminum, on the other hand, requires only about 5% of the energy that’s needed to produce the metal in power-hungry smelters. As a result, it’s generally a faster, cheaper, and lower-carbon way of making aluminum products.

“The domestic market is hungry for sustainable, high-quality recycled aluminum,” said Michael Siemer, Sortera’s CEO.

The country’s use of scrap will climb even higher once two new rolling facilities — which shape aluminum into plates, sheets, and coils — ramp up production. Steel Dynamics rolled its first hot coils at a $1.9 billion plant in Mississippi this summer. Novelis, which is partnering with Sortera to use the startup’s rescued aluminum, is slated to bring its $2.5 billion facility on line in Alabama later next year.

“For them to be green, they each are going to need an additional billion pounds of scrap aluminum,” Siemer estimated.

Despite the growing domestic appetite for aluminum, much of what the country recycles still gets exported overseas, particularly when it’s lumped together with other metals like copper, brass, and titanium. Magnets can easily pull out pieces of steel from scrap piles, but aluminum alloys are tricky to sort. That leaves behind roughly 18 billion pounds of mixed-metal material per year, about 10 billion of which include aluminum alloys, according to Sortera.

“We generally scoop it up, put it into ships, and send it to Southeast Asia,” where the metals are sorted by hand, Siemer said of the industry’s approach. ​“Or it’s made into low-value products in America, where you can melt the aluminum down” with the other metals, he added, likening the process to melting a box of colorful crayons into a functional, but less desirable, brown soup.

Sortera’s founders, Nalin Kumar and Manual Garcia, launched the company in 2020 to introduce more precision and automation to this sorting process. After spinning out of an Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy program that focused on recycling metals for lightweight vehicles and aircraft, the startup raised money from firms including Chrysalix Venture Capital and the Bill Gates–affiliated Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Sortera said the funding announced this week brings its total investment to about $120 million.

Other early-stage companies are working on new ways to pluck recyclable materials out of the gobsmacking amounts of garbage we generate every day. Greyparrot, for example, has developed AI camera systems that recycling firms can install to track aluminum cans, glass bottles, and plastic packaging as they move down conveyor belts. The startup Amp uses software-driven robotic systems inside its own plants to automatically sort materials.

But Sortera handles only scrap metal, and it hunts for only specific types of high-quality aluminum alloys — ones that manufacturers like Novelis are typically willing to pay more for. The company’s Indiana facility can also process scrap at high enough volumes to justify handling it domestically, Siemer said.

“They’re getting into a really interesting niche,” said Parker Bovée, who leads waste and recycling research for the consulting firm Cleantech Group. ​“If you can get pure sorted alloys, then you know exactly what you’re dealing with,” which makes the metal more valuable to the companies turning it back into car frames, engine blocks, or complex metal parts.

Bovée said that from an investment standpoint, he considers Sortera’s approach to be higher risk than a software-only solution, since it involves spending more capital to build facilities and machinery. Waste management in general ​“is a difficult industry to break into and make substantial inroads,” he said. But Sortera’s ability to capture sought-after alloys ​“makes them very impressive.”

Siemer added that Sortera will eventually use its technology to sort the other metals found in shredded scrap piles. But for now, he said, ​“We’re building a business on the aluminum.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Sortera_Alloys.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c3fbf561e43b20cfab094d63e25d5a9d,N,,2025-11-20 16:03:20.051134

Since the Region D Water Board meeting, tensions over the proposed Grand Saline reservoir have escalated.","Smoke curled lazily from the kitchen, carrying the sweet weight of brown sugar and spice through the room. An elk and two whitetail deer stared down from the wall, their glass eyes fixed above a Texas flag and a scattering of wooden crosses. Around a circular laminate table, the group of locals bent over a printout titled “The City of Canton: Annual Water Usage vs. Availability Report.” Across from me, behind polarized Ray-Bans, a big beard, and a lattice of tattoos, sat a pitmaster named John Borgstedt. Known to locals by his Facebook username, “BBQ and a Prayer,” he was ready to explain how the fight for his livelihood had become inseparable from the fight against the reservoir and the leaders he believes are selling out their own people.

As John’s wife, Virginia Borgstedt, set plates of steaming barbecue chicken and paprika-dusted potato salad on the table, John began to talk. His story reaches back to a childhood scarred by abuse and years in and out of prison before he rebuilt his life through faith and grit. An oilfield explosion later shattered his body and ended his work in the industry. So he set up on Interstate 20 with a cooler and a cutting board on his tailgate, selling barbecue to whoever stopped.

Here in Van Zandt County, which is an hour east of Dallas and stretches across long fenceline miles of pasture and pine, the proposal to build a new reservoir on Grand Saline Creek ignited a fight over land rights, public trust, and the future of rural East Texas. City officials argue the project is necessary to secure Canton’s long-term water supply, but residents say it’s built on inflated population estimates, misleading data, and a failure to follow state transparency laws. Now, landowners, local organizers, and state lawmakers are pushing back, insisting the reservoir threatens generational homes and livelihoods.

The fight over government transparency in Van Zandt County began February 2025 when local realtor Christy Beckham questioned claims that the county jail was overcrowded, leading her to connect with Borgstedt and another local Laurie Wilson, as officials simultaneously pushed for a costly new courthouse while declining a nearly $10 million state restoration grant. The group—suspecting officials may have been manufacturing crises to justify major spending—began to pull public records, attend town meetings, and share their findings online.

The turning point came in March 2025 when a Texas Historical Commission preservation coordinator publicly corrected county officials’ misleading statements—portions of which were later removed from an official meeting video—galvanizing the trio to expose the incident on Facebook. What began as a modest barbecue-and-scripture page evolved into a watchdog platform as Borgstedt posted documents, meeting clips, and maps that brought widespread attention to concerns of local mismanagement and eroding public trust.

The same summer afternoon in August as my visit with Borgstedt, I wound my way through the backroads of Grand Saline, a small town of just over 3,000, the pastures lush and the kudzu heavy with the late summer rains. Along a fenceline, an American flag snapped in the breeze above a cardboard sign, half-swallowed by wildflowers, that read: “Protect Your Land: Stop Canton’s Dam on Saline Creek.”

I pulled into the parking lot of the New Testament Holiness Apostolic Church. Meeting me outside were Cody and Chain Swain, brothers who grew up along the bends and muddy banks of the Grand Saline Creek Basin. Inside the fellowship hall of the small country church, we sat beneath humming fluorescent lights and they told me about the fight Borgstedt had set in motion.

To understand the fight over the water reservoir, one must take the time to understand Van Zandt County’s geography. Canton lies at its hub, with places like Grand Saline, Wills Point, and Ben Wheeler radiating outward, each a small world tied together by county roads and pastureland. Grand Saline, true to its name, rests over the largest and purest salt dome in the United States, where brine-rich earth has shaped both the economy and identity. Morton Salt owns and continues to operate the vast underground rock-salt mine beneath the Grand Saline Salt Dome in the county.

The populations in these towns number only in the hundreds or a few thousand, places where families have lived on the same plots of land for generations. However, there is a force in Canton that has shaped the county’s fate for decades: First Monday, a monthly flea market billed as the “world’s largest flea market.” Once the lifeblood of Canton, First Monday’s decline—ushered in by online marketplaces and commercialization—has fueled suspicions that city leaders began looking to the reservoir as the town’s next salvation, a lake that could lure outsiders, their wallets, and keep Canton afloat.

This all began in 2004. As Canton officials looked ahead to the city’s projected growth, the question of long-term water security came sharply into focus. At a city meeting that year, the mayor and a hired consultant reviewed the Citizen Advisory Committee’s draft comprehensive plan, noting that Van Zandt County’s growth rate was outpacing the city’s and that water would become harder to secure. With just 5.5 square miles within its boundaries, the city discussed a strategy to manage future water demand. This urgency propelled Canton into a series of evaluations and studies, each step tightening the focus on one truth: The city’s future would hinge on a stark choice between just three imperfect options.

The first path was to buy potable and non-potable water from the nearby city of Tyler, a deal dressed in security but bound by an expiration date with no promise of renewal. The second was to raise or dredge Mill Creek Lake, a shallow 237-acre reservoir for which Canton already had water rights. The third path reached the farthest, presenting the Sabine River—which winds for hundreds of miles through pine and prairie before spilling into the Gulf—as the choice to be dammed, a plan that would erase homes and land, submerging family legacies under the banner of “water rights” for a need that remains unproven.

In 2008, a survey was conducted by Gary Burton Engineering at the City of Canton’s request. The firm evaluated five potential reservoir locations. Two were quickly dismissed as unsuitable, while three—the Grand Saline site included—were examined in more detail. Of these, the Grand Saline site was determined to be the worst option: “Three optional dam sites on Grand Saline Creek were investigated and eliminated from further consideration based on excessive relocation costs for gas wells and pipelines,” the report stated.

The City of Canton based its reservoir plans on the assumption that its population would grow to 34,000 residents by 2065, filling every available space within the city limits and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. (The current population stands at 4,229.) Under that projection, officials claimed the city would face a daily water shortage of 5.78 million gallons. However, Burton’s survey directly contradicted this. Following his survey, Burton pointed out that he reached out to the City of Tyler, a city with a population above 100,000, about 40 miles from Canton, which had agreed to supply Canton with that exact amount. He also contacted the Neches River Authority, which confirmed that at the time there were 25,000 acre-feet of unallocated water rights on Lake Palestine, an existing large freshwater reservoir. With these options on the table, Burton’s survey proved, the idea that Canton would run out of water simply wasn’t true.

While this pursuit to build a new reservoir seems harmless at first glance, Chad Swain pulled up a text message from a neighbor sharing with him a newspaper article that ran in 2009 after the survey was discussed. The article published on March 27th, 2009, read, “A 237-acre reservoir named Mill Creek Lake already exists southeast of Canton, but it is not considered a major draw for fishing or other recreational pursuits. And while the main focus of the new reservoir is water storage, the lake could be tailored to help draw more water enthusiasts to the area already known for its First Monday Trade Days.” This introduced the suspicion that the reservoir project was not solely for the sake of water needs; there were ulterior motives present in the construction of the lake.

In 2017, the City of Canton commissioned an engineering firm to revisit the idea of a reservoir, this time focusing exclusively on the Grand Saline Creek site, despite Burton’s survey finding evidence that this site was not the most advantageous for the community. They acknowledged the earlier engineering concerns but pressed forward with a more detailed evaluation. The report reiterated the high costs tied to moving pipelines, gas wells, and roadways, while also noting the impact on surrounding farmland and existing utilities. Despite these red flags being confirmed again, the Grand Saline site remained under discussion, its viability framed less by technical promise than by the persistence of officials determined to keep the project alive.

On April 22, 2025, Canton quietly filed its water rights permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), but buried in the paperwork was a telling detail: The city wasn’t claiming its own rights to the Sabine. Instead, it invoked a Certificate of Adjudication held by the Sabine River Authority (SRA), meaning any reservoir built would be under SRA’s control, not Canton’s. For residents who were told the project would secure the city’s independence, the revelation stung. The filing, signed by Mayor Lou Ann Berry on April 15, 2025, also included letters from City Manager Lonny Cluck dated February 25, formally notifying Van Zandt County’s four commissioners and setting the stage for the next phase of the reservoir project.

Per TCEQ regulations, Canton’s Grand Saline Reservoir application should have triggered strict public notice requirements: a notice in the local paper, a plain-language summary posted online, and direct communication so residents could understand the project and weigh in. If the rules had been followed, neighbors should have seen clear notices in paper and online, with a summary of the permit’s purpose and impacts. But in this case, neither the Swain brothers, nor any of their neighbors recall receiving a letter, reading a notice in the paper, or otherwise being alerted to the project.

Some landowners around the creek had seen their property appraisals drop significantly in the year or two before the plan for the reservoir was announced. Wilson pulled up a picture of a map composed of pieces of printer paper taped together with a map of the Grand Saline Creek region pieced together. This map that she had prepared was colored pink and yellow, each region representing a different parcel of land painstakingly pulled from the Van Zandt County Appraisal District. The colors told the story plainly: This was not an isolated case, but a widespread reduction in property values. In some areas, families saw their land devalued by over 30 percent, while others faced cuts as steep as 40 percent—tens of thousands of dollars in lost value, suddenly erased from their most important asset. One parcel, long held in the same family, saw its appraisal fall from nearly $1.2 million to just over $600,000, a 46 percent decrease.

Wilson pointed out a telling pattern: While the value of properties all across the county increased, the Van Zandt County Appraisal District lowered the values of the tracts that sit on the footprint of the proposed reservoir. The contrast deepens the suspicion that these devaluations are not isolated adjustments but a coordinated reshaping of the land market in anticipation of Canton’s project.

In a statement provided by Canton City Manager Lonny Cluck, the city emphasized that the Grand Saline Reservoir project had been publicly discussed and documented since its inception around 2009. “The city has always been transparent and has made all required notifications and filings at the local, regional, and state level in connection with the project,” he said in an email. Cluck stated that notices were mailed to affected landowners at the time and that each stage of planning occurred in compliance with the Texas Open Meetings Act, with filings made at the local, regional, and state levels. He rejected the idea that economic development was a motivation behind the project, saying the city viewed the reservoir solely as a long-term water supply option for Canton and neighboring communities.

Mayor Berry emphasized in a statement to the Observer that the city does not currently face an immediate water shortage and stated that the Grand Saline Reservoir had been considered only as a long-term planning option encouraged by the Texas Water Development Board. Berry expressed personal concern about the declining aquifer levels in the region and the possibility that large-scale water projects in neighboring counties could alter groundwater flow, adding that some wells in the area have already become unstable due to manganese concentrations. She also cited rapid residential development from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex as an unpredictable factor. “We can control growth but we can’t stop it. Drill Baby Drill seems to be everyone’s motto including us,” Berry said.

City pumpage records filed with TCEQ show that Canton has no water shortage, only a surplus. The city is permitted to draw over a billion gallons annually, yet from 2017 through 2024, it never once used more than 252 million gallons in a year, averaging less than 20 percent of its available capacity. In fact, 2024 marked the lowest usage in nearly a decade at just 192.8 million gallons, and 2025 is on track to fall even lower. Far from running out of water, Canton currently has the ability to supply five times its present population without adding a single new source, records show.

This fight for the community members was often centered in the fellowship hall of the Swain family church, where Chad and Cody sat shoulder to shoulder. They told me how they called a community meeting at their church in late June; the hall overflowed with neighbors angry at the thought of losing their land to the reservoir. Many of those in attendance signed on to a letter that listed the facts, citing the surveys, the population estimates, and detailing what they saw as the immoral nature of the project. At the back of the room sat Borgstedt, silent and watchful behind his sunglasses. He slipped out the door without a word once the meeting was done, later sending a message to the Swain brothers that read: “I’ve seen enough.”

Following the meeting at the Swain family church on June 29, Borgstedt stepped into the role of public chronicler, especially considering the local papers had failed to cover this issue. His Facebook page became a running ledger of what he was uncovering and what officials would not say. He drew on permits, pumpage totals, and charts to show how the city’s claims about a shortage didn’t add up. By July 30, as notice of a commissioners court meeting went out, Borgstedt was posting documents and analysis for residents to see for themselves. As the county held workshops and townhalls, Borgstedt had primed the community with plain-spoken posts that stripped the technical veneer off city documents.

On August 13, the Texas Water Development Board Region D Water Planning Group was scheduled to hold a meeting, with the Grand Saline Reservoir on the agenda, a couple counties over in the town of Pittsburg. The fight over Canton’s reservoir proposal gained some traction. The day before, state Representative Brent Money—a first-term right-wing Republican—sent a formal letter urging the group to remove all mention of the Grand Saline Creek Reservoir from its 2026 Regional Water Management Plan, citing Canton’s surplus water supply projections through 2060, the availability of lower-impact alternatives like groundwater wells and reuse, and the collapse of regional support for the project.

At the meeting, Borgstedt leaned toward the camera he and Beckham had set up in the conference room in Pittsburg. His voice carried as he ensured the people logging onto the livestream could hear him: “Thank you, everybody, for coming into the live. This is such an important message and this is a very big vote. This is something that is definitely going to change, if not influence, the outcome.” Wilson and other local opponents were there as well, carrying eight years’ worth of water reports compiled into spreadsheets and graphs.

The board meeting that morning drew an unusually large and fervent crowd, filling the board’s biggest room despite the stormy weather and it being a midweek workday. Dozens of residents and landowners rose to speak in defense of their homes, some having traveled over an hour to stand with their neighbors. Representative Money showed up and delivered his own remarks in opposition, as did a staffer from Senator Bob Hall’s office. Their presence underscored the gravity of the moment, signaling that opposition to the project had reached a new level of visibility.

Richard Garza, the Van Zandt County representative to the Region D Water Board, took the floor as the livestream showed Mayor Berry waving to the camera and leaning in to whisper to the man beside him. Garza began plainly: “This situation has turned into a bit of a fiasco, and I don’t feel it was my doing, so I will blame it on the City of Canton.” As he spoke, Berry rose from her chair, moving to the back of the room. Garza then walked the board through the project history—referencing the 2004 meeting, the water studies of 2008 and 2017, and laying out in detail the City of Canton’s misrepresentation of data. What began as a measured presentation of evidence gradually swelled with emotion, Garza’s calm voice giving way to urgency as he spoke of the people around Grand Saline Creek whose homes and land were caught in the balance.

Garza finished with a blistering critique of Canton’s reservoir push, as exclamations of “Amen” and “She’s going to jail” can be heard in the background of the livestream. He argued the city had repeatedly misrepresented data, cycling through engineering firms until they found one that gave them answers they wanted, even though every study referenced the 2008 recommendations. Garza urged the board to take an unprecedented step of opposing Canton’s water rights request, reminding them that while Region D held no legal authority, TCEQ often heeded its recommendations. His voice sharpened as he described the city’s tactics: “This is the lengths the elected officials of the City of Canton will go to in order to get their way. … They cannot justify their population. The data and the math are not on their side.” Then, in one of the meeting’s most searing moments, he declared: “I’m tired of them—the City of Canton—molesting the citizens of Van Zandt County.”

At the end of the nearly 4-hour meeting, the people of Van Zandt County secured what many described as a major victory for their land, water, and community. In a unanimous vote, the board members removed the Grand Saline Creek Reservoir from the list of alternative water sources for Canton and issued formal opposition to the TCEQ. For those who had packed the meeting hall, it was a validation of their voices. For John Borgstedt and his team, who had spent the last few months gathering documents, speaking with neighbors, and pressing the board for transparency, the decision marked victory.

Since the Region D Water Board meeting, tensions over the proposed Grand Saline reservoir have escalated. On August 15, Borgstedt issued a call to the Van Zandt County attorneys to help pursue the legal removal of Mayor Berry via a state statute that allows a district judge to remove a mayor for official misconduct. Organizers allege city leaders failed to uphold their legal duties and have pledged to provide documents and evidence to support their case. On August 20, Governor Greg Abbott added a proposal to protect East Texas aquifers to this year’s second special legislative session agenda, marking a significant development in the ongoing fight over water rights. In the same session, Representative Money filed House Bill 162, aimed at limiting eminent domain abuse by prohibiting cities and counties from seizing land outside their jurisdictions and closing loopholes that enable cross-boundary acquisitions. Money’s bill didn’t pass.

On October 31, after months of advocacy and meetings, the Canton City Council voted unanimously to withdraw its application for the Grand Saline Reservoir, formally ending the city’s pursuit of the project after more than a decade of planning. In a media release, Berry stated that shifting political support, renewed public opposition, and changing regional conditions contributed to the council’s decision to let the project “go to the wayside.” Cluck, the city manager, noted that the project initially carried broad municipal and county support, and expressed disappointment that, in the city’s view, the support eroded under political pressure rather than changing water-resource needs.

The city’s withdrawal of the reservoir application may mark a turning point, but no one here is calling the fight finished. The Swain brothers have heard the story of Marvin Nichols, a North Texas aquifer that was similarly contested. They remember stories of men their age, who stood in their town halls, voices thin with age, warning their children to hold the line long after they were gone. That is the inheritance of Cody and Chad Swain, and of Van Zandt County. And though the permit has been pulled, the cardboard signs stay staked in tall grass. Because there, the fight is not a burden but a birthright, passed down like the land from one generation to the next, and the land remains with those who love it long enough to remain.",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stopthedam4.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 17:01:29.896603

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday announced the availability of $6.5 billion in new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act funding for water systems, along with an additional $550 million for states, and approved five new federal loans supporting major water projects in Texas, Illinois, Oregon, and Florida.

The funding is available through a rolling application process. EPA officials said the WIFIA program continues to serve as a critical financing tool to help communities modernize water systems, protect public health, and reduce long-term costs.

“Modernizing and maintaining water infrastructure is essential to ensuring clean and safe water for all Americans and advancing EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative,” said Jessica Kramer, EPA’s assistant administrator for water. “Communities use these competitive loans to upgrade water infrastructure to benefit residents and businesses while loan payments reimburse the U.S. Treasury.”

The agency’s 2025 Notice of Funding Availability marks the ninth round of WIFIA financing since the program’s launch during the first Trump administration. This year’s round designates $6.5 billion for WIFIA loans and $550 million for state infrastructure financing authorities through the State WIFIA program. EPA is currently accepting letters of interest for both programs.

EPA said priority will be given to projects that support safe drinking water, reduce pollution in U.S. waterways, bolster energy development, advance state and local water priorities, spur innovation, and promote economic growth.

Newly Approved WIFIA Loans

EPA also announced approval of five loans for projects aimed at improving wastewater treatment, drinking water resilience, and system reliability:

Fort Worth, Texas — A $347 million loan to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment systems and build a new water reclamation facility to support future growth and expand water reuse for industrial and irrigation purposes.

Pflugerville, Texas — A $176 million loan for a series of drinking water and wastewater improvements, including a new wastewater treatment plant, expansion of collection systems and water main rehabilitation. This is the city’s second WIFIA loan.

Joliet, Illinois — An $87 million loan to help the city shift from a stressed aquifer to a Lake Michigan water supply and modernize its distribution system to reduce water loss. The city has received three WIFIA loans totaling $395 million.

Ashland, Oregon — A $73 million loan to build a new drinking water treatment plant that will provide a safer and more resilient supply for the rural community.

Wilton Manors, Florida — A $28 million loan to replace aging water mains, rehabilitate wastewater lift stations and force mains, and upgrade stormwater drainage to reduce failure risks, particularly during severe weather.

About WIFIA

Created by Congress in 2014, the WIFIA program provides long-term, low-cost loans for nationally and regionally significant water infrastructure projects. The program leverages federal financing with state, local and private investment to accelerate upgrades and reduce overall project costs.

EPA says its rolling selection process allows a broad range of borrowers — including small communities and private entities — to participate. To date, the agency has announced $22 billion in WIFIA financing for 141 projects, supporting more than 160,000 jobs nationwide.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/1120EPDam.jpeg,N,,2025-11-20 16:02:00.160781

This interagency guidance, known as “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions,” represented a three-way pact among the FDIC, Fed Board, and the OCC. The guidance imposed burdensome climate-related financial risk principles that bank managers were expected to implement. Specifically, it required large financial institutions – namely banks and asset managers – with more than $100 billion in assets to adopt a set of government-prescribed climate risk management principles.

These principles establish how bank leaders should manage risks associated with climate change threats. They include protocols for securing financial assets against physical risks from severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. Large institutions were also expected to establish standards for mitigating risks tied to organizational transitions from climate change, such as shifting from fossil fuel reliance to renewable energy via wind and solar power.

These guidance principles generated fierce pushback from Republicans in Congress. In April 2024, House Republicans advanced a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval against each regulator’s principles. Members of the House Financial Services Committee successfully adopted the resolutions to nullify the Fed Board’s, FDIC’s, and OCC’s principles.

Unfortunately, the CRAs only advanced out of committee and were never voted on by the full House. They were very unlikely to be signed into law by President Joe Biden at the time. With Trump back in office, this new change in executive branch policy represents a major turn away from the previous ESG-aligned regulatory regime.

For context, administrative guidance is not the same as actual rules and regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act, § 553 sec (A), enables guidance manuals such as these principles to bypass the notice-and-comment process. Guidance represents sub-regulatory content that allows regulators to issue interpretations of their policy positions and signal what they expect from regulated parties.

Agency guidance, including the above principles, is not legally binding. The trio of agencies claimed that they adopted the guidance within the boundaries of their enabling statues. To this end, “the agencies did not incorporate suggestions for changes to the draft principles that extend beyond the agencies’ statutory mandates relating to safety and soundness,” according to the principles.

The principles are non-legislative rules meant to encourage large financial institutions to adopt risk-adjusted protocols. They effectively projected the Biden administration’s environmental policy position on the perceived threats of climate change.

However, earlier this year, I made the case that the three agencies exceeded their statutory missions by imposing these principles. In my public policy memo for State Policy Network (SPN), I explain how the interagency guidance intrudes on large financial institutions’ internal risk management protocols.

Though nominally voluntary, this guidance was crafted to shift the behavior of the largest financial institutions toward treating climate change as a serious systemic threat to their financial interests. The guidance directs the boards of large banks to “allocate appropriate resources to support climate-related financial risk management.” Such behavior would trigger a domino effect, prompting smaller and mid-sized institutions to mimic the big banks under these principles.

Contrary to the agencies’ claims, these principles exceed their statutory authority to ensure safety and soundness. As I explain in my SPN memo, it’s not the role of financial regulators to equate external climate change risks with traditional risks facing financial deposits.

In fact, these regulatory bodies oversee how banks manage internal financial risks facing depositors. Such risks are concrete, grounded in detectable issues that customers may encounter when preserving their savings and assets.

For example, the FDIC’s risk management manual only addresses the threat of real environmental risks, rather than hypothetical climate threats. It suggests banks should consider these instructions to avoid noncompliance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980.

Similarly, the OCC’s supervisory authority for banks begins and ends with mitigating risks to consumer interests and access to reputable services. Hypothetical climate change risks fall well outside the agency’s mandate. And the Fed Board requires bank holding companies to maintain a risk management framework. It does not adopt its own set of risk management principles to combat climate change or anything else.

We should encourage more deregulatory efforts across the federal government to eliminate mandatory ESG policies. While such rules and regulations are a primary focus of regulatory reformers in the current administration, many low-profile guidance documents flying under the radar require attention. If not for the congressional uproar against these climate risk principles, the current leadership at the FDIC, OCC, and Fed Board may have still been enforcing this problematic guidance. Bank regulators must focus only on concrete, demonstrable financial risks and allow banks to manage those risks as they deem fit.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ESG-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 16:01:40.544996

This move marks a major reduction of a program established over 15 years ago. The Proposal drew over 53,000 comments from diverse stakeholders, including industry, environmental groups, state officials, tribes, and the public. Environmental organizations opposed the rollback, emphasizing the GHGRP’s role in climate policy, transparency, and federal incentives.[5] They argued EPA’s authority under section 114(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) supports maintaining the program, warning that its removal could hinder climate risk assessment and disproportionately harm vulnerable communities.[6]

Industry feedback was mixed. Many acknowledged the GHGRP’s benefits for emissions management, investor disclosures, and global market compliance, while criticizing EPA claims of cost savings.[7] Industry groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argued that the costs of rescinding—such as disruption of ongoing projects and investments—far outweigh the purported savings.[8] Some supported EPA’s narrower interpretation of its Clean Air Act authority and suggested a targeted[9] or voluntary[10] approach instead.

If finalized, the rule would take effect 60 days after publication. Given the significant public concern, legal challenges are likely, especially in light of recent court rulings emphasizing independent interpretation of EPA’s authority under the CAA.[11] The outcome remains uncertain, with potential implications for federal and state climate programs that rely on GHGRP data.[12]

Nov. 19 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is considering delaying for one or two years its proposed cuts in incentives for imported biofuels amid pressure from U.S. refiners who argue the move could raise costs and tighten fuel supplies, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The delay now under discussion could please domestic oil refiners that have invested in the bio-based diesel sector but would risk frustrating U.S. farmers and biofuel producers.

The proposal for the Environmental Protection Agency to slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels was initially pitched this year as part of Trump's ""America First"" energy agenda, aimed at boosting domestic production and reducing reliance on foreign supply, and was meant to take effect Jan. 1.

The Environmental Protection Agency is now weighing a plan to delay implementation of that proposal until 2027 or 2028, the sources told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The EPA said it is reviewing public comments ahead of issuing final rules in the coming months. The agency declined to comment on whether it is considering a delay. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher - an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into next year's congressional elections.

Under the proposed cuts in credits for imports, the EPA would allocate only half as many tradable renewable fuel credits to imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks as to domestic ones. The shift has significant implications for bio-based diesel, which relies on imports to meet federal mandates.

The decision on a possible delay is one of several high-profile regulatory moves by the administration that the fuel industry is closely watching.

Others include finalizing 2026 biofuel blending mandates, determining whether to allow year-round sales of gasoline blended with 15% ethanol, or E15, and deciding how or whether to require larger refiners to compensate for exempted gallons under the small refinery waiver program.

The protracted U.S. government shutdown and efforts to resolve a logjam of small refiner requests for exemptions from U.S. biofuel laws have also contributed to delays in resolving regulatory moves related to biofuels, the sources said.

Plastipak, Katoen Natie Expand Capital Region Facilities

In the Capital Region, east of Lafayette, Plastipak Packaging Inc. is expanding its Rapides Parish manufacturing facility — a $53.8 million, 200,000-square-foot expansion to add warehouse space and up to five new production lines. The warehouse expansion will provide Plastipak with additional space to store both raw materials and finished goods. The new production lines will include conveyor and compression systems, molds, labeling and printing systems, while planned upgrades to existing lines will increase the use of recycled plastic, enhancing efficiency and sustainability.

“Since Plastipak began construction of its Pineville plant in 2003, our team has been extremely impressed with and appreciative of the collaboration and support from local and state government officials and local organizations,” said Plastipak Holdings President and CEO Ed Morgan. “The long-term support and business-friendly environment in Louisiana has allowed Plastipak to expand the facility several times over the past 20-plus years, and allows us to announce the current investment. We look forward to increasing our manufacturing and recycling capabilities in Pineville and supporting our customers in Louisiana.”

The company is expected to create 15 direct new jobs while retaining 340 current positions. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 25 indirect new jobs, for a total of 40 potential new jobs in the Central Region. The state of Louisiana has offered Plastipak Packaging an incentives package that includes the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart and participation in the state’s Retention and Modernization Program. In addition, Plastipak is expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and Quality Jobs programs.

Plastipak last expanded its Pineville facility in 2017 with a $15 million investment. The current project is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2026.

Plastipak Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Plastipak Holdings Inc., is a global designer, manufacturer and recycler of plastic packaging containers and performs for some of the world’s largest consumer products companies. Plastipak operates 38 manufacturing and five recycling sites in the United States, South America and Europe, with a total of over 5,400 employees. Plastipak was founded in 1967 and is headquartered in Plymouth, Michigan.

Also this week, in the capital city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a groundbreaking was held for the $25 million expansion of Katoen Natie Baton Rouge, LLC. Located at the company’s Baton Rouge Polymers Terminal, this project adds a logistics facility to support the growing specialty chemicals and advanced materials industries, strengthening the Capital Region’s position as a hub for industrial distribution and manufacturing.

Katoen Natie is expected to create 13 direct new jobs, while retaining 29 current positions in East Baton Rouge Parish. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional nine indirect new jobs, for a total of 22 potential new job opportunities in the Capital Region.

“With this project Katoen Natie reconfirms that Baton Rouge is key within its global network of high end logistics and added value platforms for the chemical industry,” said Katoen Natie’s President of Specialty Chemicals Sam Dhollander. “Louisiana continues to be a region where chemicals and petrochemicals continue to have and find a home in an ever more challenging global economy.”

The project includes a new 300,000-square-foot warehouse for the storage and repackaging of titanium dioxide (TiO₂), amongst other products, which is produced in Lake Charles and used in coatings, plastics and other industrial applications. The expansion reflects Katoen Natie’s continued investment in Louisiana. Construction is expected to be completed by October 2026, with operations beginning the following month.

“Since 1972 Americans have struggled to understand what Congress meant when it included the term ‘waters of the United States’ in the Clean Water Act.
Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer said he was confident that the rule will prioritize clean water while protecting farmers, ranchers, landowners and businesses alike.
They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon,” Foote continued.
Environmental Defense Fund Associate Vice President Will McDow stated Monday that the new proposed WOTUS rule from the Trump administration that will redefine which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act Protections.","Updated at 8 a.m. Thursday to include the link to the Federal Register, which published the proposed rules Thursday after the story posted, and public comment information.

The two federal agencies with jurisdiction over navigable waterways have published amendments to the existing “waters of the United States” rule that they say will “establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition” of the term, and a public comment period has opened.

The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Army’s changes have heightened worry among conservation groups that federal protections for isolated wetlands might be weakened further than they were soon after the 2023 Supreme Court decision that found wetlands must be connected by surface water to a navigable body of water to fall under the 1972 Clean Water Act.

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers said in a release Monday that the newly proposed changes were to “fully implement the court’s direction by focusing on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes—and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies.”

As part of the announcement, leadership posted the prepublication notice they planned to submit to the Federal Register, which was published Thursday, starting a 45-day public comment period.

Comments must be submitted by Jan. 5, 2026, and identified by Docket ID No. EPA–HQ– OW–2025–0322, through www.regulations.gov, by email to OW-Docket@epa.gov, or mail to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA Docket Center, Water Docket, Mail Code 28221T, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460.

Language in the Clean Water Act states that the “term ‘navigable waters’ means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” However, the act doesn’t define what “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, actually are, leaving the EPA and Corps to determine the geographic scope of the rule.

Over the last five decades, pushback and litigation have forced the two agencies to revise the definition several times.

The current regulatory definition, according to the EPA, was put in place in September 2023 to align with the May 2023 Supreme Court ruling on the Sackett v EPA lawsuit.

The Sacketts filed the lawsuit after the agency ordered the Idaho couple to restore where they had begun backfilling with dirt the section of their property that the EPA considered to be wetlands of a nearby navigable waterbody. The judges sided with the Sacketts that federally protected wetlands must have an obvious connection to waterbodies like streams, oceans, rivers and lakes.

To conform to the Sackett decision, the EPA and Army amended in September 2023 the latest final rule, which had been put in place that January.

EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle shared with Washington, D.C., lawmakers Monday afternoon an overview of the proposed rules.

“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief and happiness from farmers, ranchers, other landowners, governments that have been looking for a simple, prescriptive definition that the whole country can operate off of, and would allow individuals to know whether or not there’s a ‘water of the United States’ without having to go hire an attorney or a consultant, having to pay someone to Tell them,” Zeldin said Monday during the announcement livestreamed on the EPA’s YouTube.

The EPA secretary explained that the proposal “includes practical, common-sense revisions that will make a real difference,” and adds definitions for what he called “key terms” such as “’relatively permanent,’ ‘continuous surface connection’ and ‘tributary’ to appropriately limit the scope of what is consistent with” the Sackett case.

“We’re establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters, either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow. We’re adding a new exclusion for groundwater and revising exclusions for certain ditches prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems,” Zeldin continued. “We’re incorporating locally familiar terminology such as wet season to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS. And we’re strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources.”

He explained that the proposed rules were developed based on input from multiple sources, including preproposal recommendations, docket information from nine public listening sessions and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Telle addressed the audience after Zeldin.

“Since 1972 Americans have struggled to understand what Congress meant when it included the term ‘waters of the United States’ in the Clean Water Act. Did it apply to them? Did it not? The definition of that term has been often abused, sometimes stretched beyond recognition over time, and it’s left Americans uncertain about whether they were complying with the Clean Water Act or not,” he said Monday, adding that “under President Trump’s leadership, the EPA and army Civil Works, which oversees the Corps of Engineers, are kicking off the formal process that will give American certainty about their property once and for all.”

Several Republican officials thanked Zeldin from the podium for initiating the proposed amendments including West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey who said that “for too long there’s been great deal of uncertainty” about the WOTUS rule.

“Unfortunately, it left many people holding the bag. Farmers, contractors, small business owners guessing whether their ephemeral stream or a backyard ditch was going to be classified as a waters of the United States rule and potentially subject them to significant penalties,” he continued.

Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer said he was confident that the rule will prioritize clean water while protecting farmers, ranchers, landowners and businesses alike.

Conservation groups have been vocal about these revisions opening up isolated wetlands to development and degradation since the announcement was made.

“Wetlands are the lifeblood of our coast, and should be held to the highest standards of protection,” North Carolina Coastal Federation Coastal Advocate Kerri Allen explained. “The wetlands most impacted by these proposed rollbacks are the very wetlands that hold water during storms and help protect downstream waters. With the proposed changes, our coast will face irrevocable damage that impacts not only our wildlife and fisheries, but also our coastal economy and communities.” The Coastal Federation publishes Coastal Review.

Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Mark Sabath said Monday in a statement that this proposed rule, if adopted, “could have catastrophic ramifications for communities already plagued by flooding, water quality concerns, and drinking water shortages. After critical, longstanding protections for clean water and wetlands were drastically narrowed by the Sackett decision, we need stronger protections, not weaker, to safeguard our communities and environment.”

League of Conservation Voters Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote had a similar reaction.

“The Trump administration’s Polluted Water Rule is another blatant giveaway to big corporate polluters that will jeopardize the waters that our families and communities rely on for drinking, recreation, and fueling our local economies,” Foote said.

“In 2023, the Supreme Court’s devastating Sackett decision stripped federal protections from millions of miles of streams and tens of millions of acres of wetlands, and now corporate polluters are pushing their friends in the administration to go even further in decimating our clean water safeguards. They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon,” Foote continued.

On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request with the department arguing its justification for another extension was based on outdated assessments of the Midwestern grid operator, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, of its energy reserves heading into the winter.

The initial order, which extended operations at the J.H. Campbell coal plant from its planned closure on June 1 until August 21, initially argued the plant’s resources were needed to prevent blackouts at homes and businesses amid high demand over the summer, despite projections from the grid operator which determined it would have enough resources to meet demand from consumers.

The department’s latest order, issued Tuesday, extends operations until February 17, 2026. Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that while the North American Electric Reliability Corporation had yet to issue its reliability assessment for winter 2025-2026, assessments from the previous two years had presented concerns on whether Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s energy reserves would be sufficient in “above-normal conditions.”

However, the 2025-2026 assessment was released hours before the order was issued, with Nessel arguing its contents completely negate Wright’s arguments justifying an extension.

While the assessment found multiple regions in the U.S. could have insufficient energy to support its customers amid extreme weather, MISO was listed at a “normal risk,” meaning that its resources will be sufficient to meet operating reserves under normal and extreme peak demand and outage scenarios.

The assessment also notes that this year’s risk scenario for the grid operator should not be compared to last year’s as there have been changes to the assessment methods

“[The Department of Energy] is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a statement. “[The department] must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”

According to the plant’s owner Consumers Energy, keeping the plant operating has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day. The company was able to recoup $84 in separate costs by selling energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. He noted the costs for operating the plant are not solely borne by Consumers Energy customers, but by ratepayers across the grid.

California's EV adoption reached a new record in the third quarter.

The consortium's EV charging stations are located at sites with amenities such as restaurants and driver lounges.

Ionna, the public fast-charging consortium backed by eight major automakers including General Motors, Stellantis and Toyota, said Thursday it will increase its investment in California over the next three years to serve the state’s growing number of EV owners.

The joint venture plans to invest $250 million in California through 2029, and has now contracted more than 1,000 charging bays there. That means California will account for nearly a quarter of Ionna’s planned 4,000 chargers nationwide, which is unsurprising for the country’s largest EV market, where a record 29.1% of new cars sold in the third quarter were electric.

Reliable, high-speed charging stations with basic amenities like food, restrooms and a place to decompress or work are less common but growing in the U.S. Ionna’s whole business model focuses on placing stations where drivers already tend to stop, including chains like Wawa and Sheetz. In some locations, it’s also building its own flagship “rechargeries” with pet-friendly lounges, Wi-Fi, bathrooms and vending machines.

That said, “contracted” sites mean the actual deployment of the chargers could still be months or years away. These are locations where the company may have already signed agreements with site hosts like shopping centers or gas stations, but construction may not have started yet due to local permitting processes and coordination with utility companies.

Even so, Ionna’s pace suggests the rollout may move faster than expected. Despite the usual bottlenecks in permitting and utility hookups, the company has expanded quickly: less than a year after opening its first Rechargery in Apex, North Carolina, it now operates 40 stations with 384 charging ports nationwide, according to the Alternative Fuels Data Center.

I tested one of Ionna’s newer stations in Scranton, Pennsylvania, this summer, and it was the most seamless charging stop I’ve had this year. The 400-kilowatt chargers were located within a Sheetz gas station, with good lighting, clean restrooms and plenty of food options. Charging the 2026 BMW iX I was driving at the time was as simple as checking out at a shopping mall. I just tapped my card, plugged the cable in, and 15 minutes later, I had enough range added to get back on the road.

That experience is improving as five of the eight founding automakers now support plug and charge access at Ionna stations. Drivers of electric BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia and Mercedes models can simply plug in without handling payment or authentication. Ionna says Ford and Rivian vehicles now get plug-and-charge access as well.

Even though EV sales may continue to grow unevenly with the rollback of the tax credits and end of the fuel economy rules, rest assured that the infrastructure to support them is growing stronger. With more such stations coming online every week, even your grandparents can soon become bona fide EV roadtrippers.

While the assessment found multiple regions in the U.S. could have insufficient energy to support its customers amid extreme weather, MISO was listed at a “normal risk,” meaning that its resources will be sufficient to meet operating reserves under normal and extreme peak demand and outage scenarios.

The assessment also notes that this year’s risk scenario for the grid operator should not be compared to last year’s as there have been changes to the assessment methods

“[The Department of Energy] is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a statement. “[The department] must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”

According to the plant’s owner Consumers Energy, keeping the plant operating has cost the company $80 million, or more than $615,000 a day. The company was able to recoup $84 in separate costs by selling energy to Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Consumers Energy Media Relation Specialist Brian Wheeler said the company is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the Department of Energy. He noted the costs for operating the plant are not solely borne by Consumers Energy customers, but by ratepayers across the grid.

Nessel previously filed petitions for review to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for the past two extensions. The court has yet to issue a ruling.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 15:01:08.927806

Norwegian battery company to build $3.2 billion synthetic graphite plant in Ontario's 'automotive alley' Back to video

Article content

Article content

The Vianode AS plant is expected to initially create 300 jobs, and as many as 1,000 jobs once it ramps up to its full production capacity of 150,000 tonnes per year. A company spokesperson said the decision to build in St. Thomas was made well before the United States-Canada trade war started after a years-long due diligence process.

Vianode also has an offtake relationship with General Motors Co., which until last month was building electric delivery vans in Ingersoll, Ont., about a 40-minute drive east. GM recently ended production of the van due to poor sales and the company in recent weeks has held talks with workers and government officials to explore future options for the plant.

Project will create up to 1,000 jobs and support Ontario’s growing electric vehicle, energy and defence manufacturing sectors

ST. THOMAS — The Ontario government has secured an investment of $3.2 billion from Vianode, a leading global manufacturer of synthetic graphite, to establish a new, state-of-the-art facility in St. Thomas. The investment marks Vianode’s entrance into the North American market and is a major milestone in the government’s plan to build the most competitive, resilient and self-reliant economy in the G7, helping to protect Ontario’s economy and Ontario workers in the face of tariffs and economic uncertainty. Vianode’s investment will create nearly 300 new, good-paying jobs in its initial phase, with 1,000 jobs expected once the facility is at full operational capacity, generating broad economic benefits across southwestern Ontario.

“Today’s announcement is a historic milestone for southwestern Ontario and a major win for workers, creating good-paying manufacturing jobs today and for generations to come,” said Premier Doug Ford. “We’re proud to welcome Vianode to St. Thomas as we strengthen our province’s competitive advantage in a critical industry and build the most competitive, resilient, self-reliant economy in the G7.”

Synthetic graphite is essential to EV batteries, nuclear reactors, semiconductors, aerospace and defence systems, steelmaking and other strategic industries. By onshoring production, Ontario is not only creating positions at the St. Thomas facility but enabling tens of thousands of additional jobs across the supply chain, from mining and refining to battery manufacturing, research, transportation and advanced manufacturing. The government’s investment will anchor a domestic ecosystem that strengthens Ontario’s industrial capacity and long-term economic resilience.

As the first large-scale low-emission synthetic graphite facility in North America, this investment will also play a key role in displacing global reliance on China, which currently controls more than 80 per cent of the global production of this critical component.

“With economic uncertainty undermining global supply chains, Ontario continues to stand as the stable and reliable economic partner that our allies are looking for,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “As demand for synthetic graphite ramps up at home and abroad, Vianode’s investment will position the province as a leading supplier for strategic industries, ensuring that Ontario’s economy and workers benefit for years to come.”

The St. Thomas facility is being constructed in a multi-phased approach that will ultimately reach up to 150,000 tons of annual capacity — enough synthetic graphite to supply roughly two million EVs each year. To support Vianode’s commitment and the generational benefits of the project to the province’s manufacturing sector, the Ontario government is providing a loan of up to $670 million subject to a definitive agreement to support the site.

“Today marks an important step towards a resilient North American battery supply chain,” said Burkhard Straube, CEO of Vianode. “Ontario and the city of St. Thomas have been strong partners from day one, and Via TWO will bring industrial-scale, low-emission graphite to market through a phased build-out that supports customers, communities and the clean-energy transition.”

With U.S. tariffs impacting workers and businesses, the Ontario government is protecting the province by building the most resilient, self-reliant and competitive economy in the G7. Last year, Ontario attracted a historic $39 billion in investment from over 400 companies, creating nearly 25,000 good-paying jobs.

The Detroit Free Press reports that Avancez, an Oakland County-based assembler of components for GM’s BT1-based EVs, is indefinitely laying off 143 workers. The move comes as a direct result of production cuts at the GM Factory Zero in Michigan, also known as the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant.

The supplier pinned the decision squarely on its primary customer in a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) notice filed earlier this month. It stated the layoffs, impacting mostly UAW-represented assembly and sequencing workers in Hazel Park, stem from ""the sudden and unexpected cancellation of our primary customer’s second shift."" Greater advance notice proved impossible, the notice argued, due to these ""unforeseeable business circumstances."" The layoffs begin December 5th, leaving workers with little time to adjust. Following the terminations, the facility’s headcount will drop to roughly 230 employees.

Factory Zero builds the core of GM’s current electric lineup, including the GMC Hummer EV, Chevy Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

Compounding the situation for the Avancez workforce is their unresolved status with the UAW. Employees achieved union recognition in June, but they have not yet secured a first contract. This leaves them without critical protections, such as formal bumping rights. Labor expert Marick Masters of Wayne State University explained the precarious position. ""Without [a contract], the default is management has the right to set those terms and conditions,"" Masters said. The layoffs proceed in the absence of the job security a ratified agreement would typically provide, highlighting the real-world consequences of GM’s production recalibration as it navigates shifting EV demand.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Factory-Zero-GMC-Hummer-EV-Prooduction-Start-001.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 14:02:50.395442

Dive Brief:

San Antonio’s municipal electric utility, CPS Energy, on Tuesday issued a request for proposals to acquire 600 MW of solar generation through a power purchase agreement.

The utility said in a release that the procurement aligns with its Vision 2027 generation plan, “which aims to deliver affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the greater San Antonio area.”

CPS Energy has over 1 GW of solar capacity operating in the area. The utility said it plans to announce a battery storage RFP by the end of this year to add to the 470 MW of storage it has already contracted.

Dive Insight:

Mark Stover, executive director of the Texas Solar+Storage Association, noted that solar “has been the fastest growing power source in Texas for several years, with roughly 6,000 MW added to the grid over the past year alone.”

“This growth, especially when paired with the strong growth in battery storage, has increased grid reliability and helped to drive affordability,” Stover said.

While Texas remains a nationwide leader in renewable energy deployment, recent policy shifts by the Trump administration have made those assets – particularly solar and wind – more difficult to deploy.

Solar and storage projects in Texas account for nearly 40% of 116 GW of projects that the Solar Energy Industries Association said are “at risk of being targeted by the administration” because they have not received all necessary federal, state and local permits.

CPS Energy is within the territory overseen by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas, which has a nearly 100-GW interconnection queue of solar projects without a signed agreement, said Joshua Rhodes, an energy research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a City of Austin Electric Utility Commissioner.

Given that fact, plus “the coming rollback in federal tax support of renewables, it is probably an excellent time to be shopping for Black Friday deals on renewables in the ERCOT market right now,” Rhodes said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Fu0NllaOs5uq0dXpncQ4hrmGtrbXKfGxvRza6fv-dWE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01ODcyMTY3NTQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-20 14:03:30.692215

ST. THOMAS, Ontario, November 20, 2025 – Invest Ontario welcomes an anticipated investment of $3.2 billion from Vianode, a Norwegian producer of sustainable synthetic anode graphite, to establish its first North American facility in St. Thomas, Ontario.

As demand for graphite increases across strategic industries, Ontario has the opportunity to capture share in a market dominated by few players. This will diversify options for global manufacturers and help reduce the reliance on imports for Canadian companies.

Today marks an important step towards a resilient North American battery supply chain. Ontario and the city of St. Thomas have been strong partners from day one, and Via TWO will bring industrial-scale, low-emission graphite to market through a phased build-out that supports customers, communities and the clean-energy transition.

Burkhard Straube

CEO of Vianode

The St. Thomas facility would be North America’s first large-scale, low-emission synthetic graphite plant. Vianode expects that the plant would create around 300 new jobs in the initial phase, and up to 1,000 at full capacity. It would play a crucial role in securing domestic supply of a key commodity used in manufacturing, defence and energy, marking a major step towards building a resilient, sovereign critical mineral supply chain in Ontario.

Today’s announcement is a historic milestone for southwestern Ontario and a major win for workers, creating good-paying manufacturing jobs today and for generations to come. We’re proud to welcome Vianode to St. Thomas as we strengthen our province’s competitive advantage in a critical industry and build the most competitive, resilient, self-reliant economy in the G7.

Hon. Doug Ford

Synthetic graphite is a versatile critical resource increasingly in demand globally. The material forms the anode, one of the key components of lithium-ion batteries, and is essential to semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defence systems and steel production.

Through the use of proprietary technology, the company produces high-performance synthetic anode graphite with up to 90% lower CO2 emissions compared to conventional methods, contributing to a more sustainable value chain.

According to Vianode, ground preparation works are underway to enable start of production in 2028. Planned expansions would bring the Ontario plant’s total capacity to as many as 150,000 tons of synthetic graphite annually.

With economic uncertainty undermining global supply chains, Ontario continues to stand as the stable and reliable economic partner that our allies are looking for. As demand for synthetic graphite ramps up at home and abroad, Vianode’s investment will position the province as a leading supplier for strategic industries, ensuring that Ontario’s economy and workers benefit for years to come.

The Protect Martindale Brightwood Coalition (PMBC) gathered community leaders on Nov. 17 to continue speaking out against the proposal for a new data center in the neighborhood. Metrobloks, a data center developer, proposed a location at the intersection of 25th Street and Sherman Drive, but neighborhood advocates say the center will do more harm than good.

What about the environment?

Long-time resident Carrie Harris has strong ties to the neighborhood. Her husband and his parents grew up there, she raised her four children there and she recently moved back to the area.

“This project poses serious and long-term risks that far outweigh any potential benefits,” Harris said, citing the anticipated pollutants from the data center.

“A 24/7 industrial operation of this magnitude will inevitably bring noise, heat and light pollution,” Harris said.

Martindale Brightwood Environmental Justice Collaborative (EJC) Chair Elizabeth Gore said the neighborhood has made significant progress to correct environmental issues, and they do not want to go backward.

“Nothing that they’re going to bring is going to be helpful to our neighborhood,” Gore said. “We want clean air, water and soil – no data center.”

For 16 years, the Collaborative has worked to address issues such as contaminated soil and water, Gore added.

“We have lost a lot of neighbors already to contamination,” Gore said. “Our children are suffering from learning disabilities based on lead in the soil. Why would we want a humming noise all day? Why would we want any kind of negative problems in our neighborhood?”

In addition to the demand for electricity, data centers require large amounts of water to cool hardware which can put a strain on local water supply and “disrupt local ecosystems,” according to MIT News.

“We are working very hard to keep our environment safe. So, we at the Environmental Justice Collaborative, we say no to the data center,” Gore said. “We say no land use for Metrobloks.”

Metrobloks is promoting the Indianapolis location as a “Midwestern Digital hub” with access to metro areas such as Chicago, Toronto and Cleveland, according to their website. The company also claims a “low environmental risk profile” to the area.

Will the data center bring jobs?

One Voice board member Immanuel Ivey said the data center will not have lasting economic benefits for residents and it does not align with the goals of the city-certified Martindale Brightwood Quality of Life Plan.

“While the project may generate short-term construction jobs, these opportunities are temporary and there is no assurance or indication that local residents will be prioritized when hiring.”

Harris said developments should enhance the neighborhood and provide long-term economic improvement, but this project will not do that.

“We know from experience the local jobs promises almost never materialize,” said One Voice Vice President Cierra Johnson.

“The community stands firm that this project would derail years of community-led revitalization, undermine quality-of-life plans, while blocking plans for healthier, community-driven development,” according to a statement released by PMBC.

Do residents’ voices matter?

What has been most concerning to community members is their lack of inclusion in the development process. Ivey observed that here has been little community engagement thus far.

“We seek projects that align with our vision, build sustainable economic opportunity and truly support the future of our residents and neighborhood of Martindale Brightwood,” Ivey said.

Harris urge elected officials, planning boards and community leaders to reject the data center proposal, saying the community deserves better. She said many residents, like herself, have not been adequately informed about or invited to the decision-making process.

“Our community deserves development that aligns with our values, development that protects our environment, enhances our neighborhoods and offers real lasting economic opportunity for residents,” Harris said. “This project does none of these. We stand united and we ask that our concerns be taken serious right now and throughout every step of any future review process.”

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its latest outlook, providing a clear picture of how global and U.S. energy markets may shift through 2026. These updated projections highlight important changes in oil prices, gasoline and diesel costs, natural gas trends, and U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.

The chart below shows the notable forecast changes reported by EIA.

According to the EIA, global oil inventories are expected to keep rising through 2026, putting downward pressure on international oil prices. Brent crude oil is forecast to average $54 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and $55 per barrel for the full year. Although prices are projected to decrease, the 2026 forecast is still $3 higher than last month’s estimate, mainly because of updated expectations related to China’s inventory levels and global sanctions placed on Russia.

In the U.S. fuel market, retail gasoline and diesel prices are expected to fall in 2026, supported by lower crude oil prices. EIA forecasts that gasoline will average below $3.00 per gallon, marking a 10% decline from 2024. Diesel prices are expected to fall to $3.50 per gallon, which is 7% lower compared with 2024 averages. These declines may help reduce costs for transportation, agriculture, and daily consumers.

Natural gas is expected to follow a different trend. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price is projected to rise to nearly $3.90 per MMBtu this winter, driven by seasonal heating demand. For 2026, natural gas prices are expected to average $4.00 per MMBtu, a 16% increase from 2025. The rise is tied to higher LNG exports and limited production growth, which are tightening supply.

LNG exports remain one of the strongest areas of growth. The United States is expected to export 14.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG in 2025, which is 25% more than last year. Faster-than-expected expansion at Plaquemines LNG in Louisiana prompted an upward revision in export forecasts. By 2026, U.S. LNG exports are expected to grow an additional 10%, strengthening America’s role in global energy supply.

How to apply Applications for Indiana’s Energy Assistance Program opened on Oct. 1 and close at 5 p.m. April 20.","Despite a holdup in grant awards due to the federal government shutdown, a Southern Indiana agency is continuing its work connecting people to energy assistance.

Brad Wood, executive director of Ohio Valley Opportunities, said the agency served around 5,700 Southern Indiana households last season under the state’s Energy Assistance Program.

That’s a federally funded operation that provides annual payments to help people who meet certain criteria with heating and electric bills.

The EAP is aimed to help people bridge the gap. It doesn’t cover a whole season and maybe not even an entire bill.

But Wood said this and other programs Ohio Valley Opportunities offers can be critical in helping families facing financial hardship.

“Often they’re on the brink of disaster, and it enables them to achieve self sufficiency,"" he said.

And though the 43-day federal government shutdown caused delays in energy assistance in some areas, Wood said his organization is still working with a surplus from last season, and said other programs are ongoing.

“We are going to work as hard as we can to ensure that families are not in crisis and receive the services that they need,” he said.

How it works

Ohio Valley Opportunities serves five counties through the Energy Assistance Program, including Clark and Floyd.

Residents can apply online, by mail or in person for the annual energy assistance. The agency approves applicants, then the state pays the utility company directly, Wood said. Ohio Valley Opportunities pays directly for wood if someone heats their home that way.

As of last week, there weren’t new contracts this season for the EAP program or Head Start. They’ve fundraised to help keep that open until federal funds come in.

For the EAP program, they’re operating on carryover.

“I think everybody understands that during a federal shutdown, there can be funding disruptions,” Wood said last week. “But for us right now, it is business as usual, and all of our programs are currently in full operation.”

He said Wednesday federal agencies project grants to be awarded for both programs by the end of the month.

Wood said the agency is working with utility vendors to ensure they’ve received payment, and said many companies are also honoring an extension to the state moratorium on utility shutoffs in colder months.

Under Indiana law, companies that provide electric and natural gas are prohibited from cutting customers off between Dec. 1 and March 15 if they receive EAP funds or have applied and qualify.

Wood said he believes most or all companies are counting Nov. 1 as the start this season.

Overall, the need could be bigger this season.

As of last week, Ohio Valley Opportunities had gotten around 3,000 applications. Wood said that’s lower than this time last year, but they’re already seeing a lot of new clients, and he expects that to go up.

And new financial pressures this year, like the delay in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, could cause people to hold off on seeking help with utilities until food needs are met. Wood said, in talking with other service providers, it’s clear that more people are accessing food pantries.

“I think that once people figure out where their meals [are] coming from, the next is heat,” he said.

National and state concerns

The Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority reports that in fiscal year 2024, more than 120,000 households received energy assistance.

Nationwide, around 6 million households benefit from the national Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which costs around $4 billion per year. That’s according to Cassandra Lovejoy, policy and managing director at the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, or NEADA, an organization that represents the state implementers of the LIHEAP program.

She said last week they’re “very concerned” about the status of LIHEAP funding. In a normal year they would have already received funding and be providing benefits to households around the country “and that is not happening in most states right now.”

Lovejoy said the assistance only accounts for around 20% of eligible households — in some cases because people don’t know about the program or choose not to apply, or due to lack of funding.

“If we wanted to fully fund the program, we’d have to double the appropriation,” she said.

She also said the need for utility assistance can point to larger financial issues.

“If you're struggling with that bill, chances are that you're struggling with most of your other bills as well,” she said.

Danielle Drew, housing stability manager at Prosperity Indiana, said in an email that even though there is a moratorium preventing utility shutoffs in colder months, that money is still due. Families can fall behind, which can mean they face high utility costs and shutoffs after March 15.

Lovejoy expects the need for energy assistance to increase — due to inflation, rising grocery prices, delayed SNAP benefits and rising energy costs.

Information from NEADA shows that the average electric bill in Indiana rose 25% from July 2024 compared with July 2025 — the second largest increase in the country, behind Illinois. That means Hoosiers paid on average $42 more a year later.

In October, NEADA executive director Mark Wolfe called on utility companies across the United States to “maintain continuous service for all customers until federal LIHEAP funds are released and households regain access to vital financial assistance.”

CenterPoint Energy and Duke Energy, two companies that serve Southern Indiana, told LPM News they have existing programs to help customers.

At CenterPoint, that includes a partnership with the Salvation Army and balanced billing, which averages a customer’s annual payments divided by 12, so they pay the same amount every month.

Duke Energy’s offerings include interest-free payments and the company’s Share the Light Fund, which can provide up to $300 in payment help.

How to apply

Applications for Indiana’s Energy Assistance Program opened on Oct. 1 and close at 5 p.m. April 20. Residents can apply online via the state portal. Southern Indiana residents can also get information about mail or in-person applications by contacting Ohio Valley Opportunities.

To aid the process of state aid approval and allow countries to support companies in international competition in their efforts to move away from fossil fuels, the European Commission in June introduced specific conditions. Among these are guardrails for support for electricity costs for energy-intensive users, for example limiting it to at most half of a company's annual electricity consumption. It also prescribes that companies must invest at least 50 percent of the aid in new clean assets, such as renewable energy generation capacity or energy efficiency improvements.

Lawmakers say government rules may be making cars increasingly unaffordable for ordinary Americans

Automakers expected to argue that EV mandates, material prices and regulatory burdens are driving the price surge

The CEOs of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — along with a senior Tesla executive — have been asked to appear before Congress early next year to explain why the price of a new vehicle has surged to record highs. The Senate Commerce Committee scheduled the hearing for January 14, 2026, marking the most significant public showdown between lawmakers and auto industry leaders since the 2008 bailout era.

At the center of the inquiry is a straightforward but politically loaded question: Why are U.S. consumers paying so much more for a car today than they were just a decade ago? According to Senate staff, the average price of a new vehicle has more than doubled during that period, putting even entry-level models out of reach for many families. Committee Chair Ted Cruz (R-TX) says federal policies — especially emissions rules and electric-vehicle (EV) mandates — may be “making cars expensive and out of reach for American customers.”

Whether new-car prices actually doubled is debatable. Statistics from Kelley Blue Book show that average new-car prices increased significantly from about $34,428 in late 2015 to about $50,080 in 2025, not double but dramatic nonetheless. The price surge was most dramatic in the early 2020s, driven by supply chain issues.

Congress questions regulatory role in rising costs

Lawmakers plan to press the automakers on how government rules factor into sticker prices. They argue that complying with tougher emissions standards, meeting EV-transition requirements, and redesigning factories around battery-driven platforms all carry enormous costs. And while some of those costs reflect long-term climate goals, senators want to know how much of the immediate price burden is being shifted to consumers.

Automakers, for their part, have long maintained that the transition to EVs is capital-intensive, requiring new facilities, new supply chains and new materials — particularly for battery production. Lithium, nickel, graphite and other elements underpinning the EV transition have all seen volatile pricing. Industry executives are widely expected to argue that these pressures, combined with residual inflation, higher labor costs from recent union agreements, and global supply-chain instability, are driving up the cost of producing every new vehicle.

Tesla’s presence — represented by its vice president of vehicle engineering — underscores how even the most established EV manufacturer is entangled in this debate. While Tesla does not face the same legacy liabilities as the Detroit Three, it does face similar challenges in sourcing materials and scaling production.

Consumer impact at the center of the debate

For millions of Americans, the affordability crisis is not just theoretical. The price of a new vehicle now routinely surpasses $46,000, according to industry data, and monthly payments have climbed sharply due to high interest rates. Many buyers who previously relied on inexpensive sedans have found themselves funneled into SUVs or crossovers, as manufacturers have largely abandoned low-margin compact models.

The result is a consumer ecosystem where even middle-income households face limited choices. Some have shifted to the used-car market, where prices ballooned during the pandemic and have yet to fully settle. Others have delayed purchases indefinitely, creating what dealers describe as “pent-up demand” that could destabilize prices even further if economic conditions shift.

Consumer advocates warn that if Congress responds by rolling back certain regulations, the changes could have unintended consequences — weakening emissions goals or reducing incentives for automakers to preserve safety features and crashworthiness. Industry watchers also note that cost pressures may cause companies to streamline vehicle trims or de-content certain models, which could affect both safety and reliability down the line.

What happens next

Committee staff expect written testimony from all four automakers to be submitted before the January session. The hearing could prompt new legislation aimed at easing regulatory burdens, adjusting EV-transition timelines, or imposing new oversight on automaker pricing and dealer markups. If any of the executives decline to appear, subpoenas remain an option — a rarity but not unheard of for high-profile automotive inquiries.

The outcome may shape key policy debates heading into 2026, particularly as automakers balance regulatory compliance, electrification goals, and consumer affordability — a triangle of competing demands with no easy solution.

How to protect yourself when shopping during a price surge

Run a full cost-of-ownership comparison. Don’t just compare sticker prices — include fuel or charging costs, maintenance, insurance, and expected resale value.

Look for incentive stacking. EV tax credits, dealer cash, regional rebates and federal incentives can meaningfully reduce upfront costs.

Shop across regions. Prices can vary dramatically by state. High-demand areas often carry higher markups. Be sure to check sales taxes as well.

Avoid dealer add-ons you don’t need. Extended warranties, paint protection and “market adjustment” fees can add thousands.

Be flexible on drivetrain. Hybrid models may offer a better cost-to-value ratio for some buyers than fully electric or fully gas-powered vehicles.

Order rather than buy off the lot. Factory orders may avoid local markups and provide more control over options.

Check for recalls before you buy. Especially in a cost-pressured environment, ensure that safety issues aren’t being overlooked.

What to do if you’re priced out of the new-car market

Consider certified pre-owned (CPO). These offer manufacturer-backed warranties and inspections at far below the cost of new models.

Seek out last-year’s model. Dealers often discount previous-year inventory once redesigns arrive.

Downsize strategically. A smaller vehicle — or a simpler trim — can save thousands with minimal compromise. The top trim level is almost never a good deal.

Use credit unions for financing. They often offer significantly lower interest rates than dealer-arranged loans.

Delay if you can. Market volatility means prices may ease after regulatory hearings or model-year transitions.

Document any deceptive pricing. If you encounter misleading fees or bait-and-switch tactics, file a complaint with your state attorney general or the FTC.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/expensive-car-midj-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:01:56.677039

“With two kids, I no longer have the time to DIY maintain a high-strung turbo gas car like I used to.
I went with EVs primarily because they are fast, fun, and don't attract attention like a fast gas car would.""","“Today we saw a grizzly,"" says Ingrid Ritchey. “And I pulled over next to another photographer taking pictures. I rolled down the window and he whispered to me. ‘Bears are right there, 40 yards.’ If it had been a gas car making a lot of noise, he would not have been able to whisper.""

Ingrid Ritchey didn't expect to sneak up on grizzly bears when she was considering an electric vehicle. Retired in West Yellowstone, MT, Ritchey is an avid hiker and amateur photographer, touring Yellowstone National Park in her 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E.

The gas engine of her previous Honda CR-V would scare away wildlife so she could only catch glimpses. An electric vehicle lets her blend into the surroundings.

“It is so quiet, so silent, that it won't scare the bears or elk,” she says. “We are very conscious of noise, so an EV fits.”

This is just one of the surprises drivers discover when they switch their primary vehicle from gas to electric, CarMax reports.

Road Trippin’ Realities

One of the common myths of EV ownership is that electric cars aren't suitable for road trips. The truth is it depends entirely on the driver and the EV selected for the task.

“My longest trip was from Las Vegas, NV to here (West Yellowstone),"" says Ritchey. Google showed it to be a 10-hour and 30-minute drive of over 730 miles.

“The first day of driving, I had two stops,"" she says. “And it took only 30 minutes to charge. They [charging stations] are usually in a good gas station or Walmart parking lot. You stop, go to the restroom, grab a sandwich or an ice cream, and stretch your legs. Grab a cup of coffee, and then you're ready—jump in the car and go. It's really easy.""

Ritchey had made this trip in a gas vehicle before and had to stop overnight at the halfway point. This tradition continues with her EV, but instead of searching for a nearby gas station, she charges while sleeping and wakes up to a full charge. That's road trip convenience.

Erin Harty, a journalist based out of Baltimore, MD has similar thoughts about road trips. She's averaging 750 miles per week in her 2023 Chevrolet Bolt, which is incredible since she doesn't have access to home or workplace charging. She relies exclusively on the public charging network. She visits Chicago a few times per year and prefers to drive so her dogs can easily travel with her. It's a trip she often made in her Chevrolet Tahoe.

“Low gas mileage has always given me a lot of environmental guilt,"" says Harty. “Especially now that I'm driving so much. And of course, it costs a fortune [to fill up].""

Harty needed a vehicle that could haul cargo and tow, so after buying the Bolt EV, she kept her Tahoe as a secondary vehicle.

“It's about 700 miles to Chicago, and normally I try to keep moving and only stop long enough to get gas and use a restroom, maybe grab some coffee.""

Harty says if the weather cooperates, she can slog through the drive in approximately 11 hours, only stopping for gas once or twice.

“But I'm pretty wrecked once I get to where I'm going,"" Harty continues. “Driving that much without a real break just takes a lot out of you.""

She recently made the trip to Chicago in her Bolt EV. “It's just a whole different mentality. Although I did do it in one day heading out—and that was a long day—I think it took me about 16 hours door to door—it was much more relaxing, and I didn't feel awful when I arrived in Chicago.""

A common theme among EV drivers is how the slightly more frequent stops to charge improve the road trip experience. It gives the driver moments to rest, rather than the drive becoming a grueling all-day task where you're stuck behind the wheel. EV owners report arriving feeling physically and mentally fresh, even if they have to add hours to the trip.

“I'd say that being forced to stop every two and a half hours to charge for 40 minutes was actually really nice,"" says Jason P., an automotive assembly worker for a major manufacturer in Detroit, MI.

His 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E did a 1,200-mile round trip to Minneapolis last month, an event he describes as “delightful"" thanks to the calm manner of the EV.

“There's that toxic masculinity mentality, where you feel you have to ‘go until you hit empty!’ and being forced to reconcile with the fatigue I was not previously acknowledging in past cars was really refreshing. Plus, the chargers are almost always near a gas station or grocery store so ... snacks!""

Recharging the Whole Family

Despite a constantly expanding EV charging network, plugging in away from home can sometimes be tricky. Choosing when to stop as a lone driver is one thing but balancing the needs of your whole crew? That takes extra consideration.

“When we travel with two little kids, our stops are more frequent, roughly every two hours,"" says Andrew Donnan, a digital marketing and web development specialist in Greenville, SC.

“My worst range was in a Tesla Model Y Performance with a big cargo box on the top, multiple bikes on the rear, and 18-inch all-terrain tires. We got maybe 130 miles of range, but there are plenty of Tesla chargers out there, so it wasn't a concern."" With Tesla's quick charging, the kids didn't have time to get bored.

Realizing this wouldn't be the last road trip with children, Donnan swapped the compact Model Y for a full-size Rivian R1S, so he and his wife, two kids, and a dog have plenty of space during road trips. The electric SUV is ideal for his family due to the interior space, and as a car enthusiast, he appreciates the powerful performance. Donnan has owned several high-performance BMWs over the years and feels EVs are even easier when it comes to maintenance.

“With two kids, I no longer have the time to DIY maintain a high-strung turbo gas car like I used to. I went with EVs primarily because they are fast, fun, and don't attract attention like a fast gas car would.""

His previous Model Y also earned high praise for acceleration, but less so for comfort and utility, he explains, “Tesla's Model Y does ride pretty firm, and its aerodynamic shape is not good for hauling bulky things in the trunk, like a 60 lb. dog."" He says Lucy, his rescue labradoodle mix, prefers the Rivian for road trips.

“I drove the Rivian 830 miles home in 25 hours from the Chicago area,"" says Donnan. “The trip was great!"" Donnan credits the comfortable interior and extremely quiet drive for assisting with the pleasant experience. “And I even took a three-hour nap in it [at a stop]!""

Many new EV owners know to expect the unexpected with public charging and take it in their stride. “On my drive home from Chicago,"" recalls Donnan, “one EA [Electrify America] charging stop was in the middle of a parking lot being resurfaced, but it was also 2:00 a.m. They let me charge, but I would've been in a bad spot had they started laying asphalt and prevented me from charging.""

Thoughtful Advice

EVs bring with them the quirks and unique experiences that are welcomed by early tech adopters. The owners above have some advice if you're truly considering an EV.

Location, location, location...

Donnan says while he enjoyed the pervasive Tesla Supercharger network, the locations varied greatly in terms of convenience and amenities. “Sometimes the chargers are behind a fast-food place, sometimes at a gas station, and sometimes it's just in the middle of a parking lot. You really never know where they are going to be.""

Donnan's advice is to plan ahead and make sure the charger is near a place your child will want to eat. If chicken tenders make up the majority of their diet, getting stuck at a charger with only burger restaurants nearby will be a disappointment.

Know before you go

Also, Donnan says to check out the charger status before heading out. “Rivian's Adventure Network let me down once in Blowing Rock, NC, where it was offline for all six stalls."" He blamed himself, not the vehicle or network. He hadn't checked to see if the charger was showing online, and it had been down for approximately a month.

“We were okay, range-wise, to get to a different station, but it did add an hour or so of travel time. Those [Rivian] chargers are great otherwise.""

Be ready to chat

A common comment among EV owners is being “a mascot” for EV ownership. “People are also really interested in them [EVs] and will strike up a conversation with you in a parking lot to ask you about your car!"" says Harty about her Bolt.

Jason P. agrees. “The funniest part is that at every stop during daylight hours, you find cool people who want to talk EVs with you. I wish I had known earlier that everyone and their mother was going to grill me about EV ownership,"" he jokes. ""It's a really easy-going community and most drivers I've met are extremely friendly.""

Keep an open mind

Harty says researching is good, but seat time is better. “A lot of the articles are focused on specs and are full of acronyms and numbers that don't make a lot of sense at first, but you don't have to be a “car guy"" (or girl) to drive one of these.

“I will say that although learning about EVs is kind of intimidating just because it's so different from a gas vehicle, once I actually had one and started driving it, things made a lot more sense.""

Flexibility helps

Harty can’t charge her Bolt at home but takes advantage of Baltimore's robust public charging network. She regularly charges at a local park where she walks her dogs or can “fill up"" at a restaurant while eating.

She says people in apartments or with street parking should still consider an EV. “Honestly, for most people who have a garage or a driveway and just charge their car at home, an EV is a no-brainer and is super easy. I don't think you really have to think much about the range and all that. I would just tell people that not having home or office charging doesn't have to be a deal breaker; it's totally possible to do without if you have a few options for reliable, convenient public charging,"" says Harty.

EVs Work for Most People

You might be surprised at how well an EV can fit your lifestyle; it just takes a small mindset shift to adapt to charging rather than filling up with gas. Road trippers should consider the additional time needed for a trip, but also factor in arriving refreshed instead of worn out—you'll be surprised what a difference those enforced breaks make.

Families with kids will want to take a second look at charging locations, just to make sure everyone will get something from the stop. But realistically, when charging stations can be found at rest stops, retail parks, and fast-food outlets, be prepared for an in-depth discussion about snack and lunch options.

If you're considering an EV, get out there and drive one—you may be pleasantly surprised.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/88/2886db35-4989-5d3c-b126-49291e1300e4/691f45a43a855.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-20 13:02:53.115522

Progressive leaders called for answers this week for the cancelation of the EV battery plant that would have transformed the former Fisher Body plant in the Milwaukee Junction neighborhood into a clean-energy manufacturing hub.

“Current policy settings and market conditions in the United States, including recent changes to critical tax credits, have created significant uncertainty around the viability of long-term investment in advanced manufacturing,” a Fortescue spokesperson said in a statement to Crain’s Detroit Business, which first reported the news.

The company announced the proposed EV plant at the Fisher Body Plant in 2023. EV chargers, batteries and hydrogen generators were planned to have been built there.

Officials Wednesday including State Sen. Stephanie Chang said the September cancelation is a huge hit to the potential progress on local employment, industrial revitalization, and air-quality improvements.

“To cancel a critical clean energy investment in Detroit is to rip away more breathable air for our children, our grandchildren and vulnerable Michiganders,” Chang said. “The Trump administration’s rollbacks on clean energy policy is indicative of the fact that they fail to understand the positive jobs, climate and health impacts for our local communities. We should not stifle innovation or clean energy progress to keep outdated energy sources alive.”

The company cited the cutting of clean energy tax credits in Republicans’ most recent budget bill, according to a report from Politico last week.

On Wednesday, November 19, local leaders came together to demand accountability for the cancellation of the Fortescue electric vehicle battery plant – and the loss of the 600 good-paying jobs and cleaner future for Detroit families that would have come with it.

Chang spoke about Detroit’s future as a clean energy leader and how EV manufacturing has been stymied by the cancellation of clean energy incentives through the Republican-led budget bill.

The cancellation is a setback for the city’s attempt to bring a green manufacturing boom. The facility, which was to be the company’s first U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Center, was expected to create 600 jobs with an average annual wage of more than $45,000.

The project was aggressively courted by state leaders who offered $12.7 million in tax incentives and $11 million in Detroit brownfield incentives.

“Detroit has always been at the forefront of vehicle innovation, and this investment was an opportunity to show what Motor City is able to do,” said Jamie Racklyeft, Executive Director, Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance (MEVA). “We can still be the hub for electric vehicle innovation if our leaders prioritize clean energy so we can make a brighter future for transportation.”",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/IMG_2663-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:02:02.005187

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio on Wednesday ordered three FirstEnergy utilities to pay $250.7 million for the H.B. 6 corruption scandal and other rule violations.

The PUC ordered Ohio Edison Co., The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. and The Toledo Edison Co. to pay $186.6 million in refunds and restitution to their customers and to pay $64.1 million in civil forfeitures.

The utilities must refund $180 million to their customers over three billing cycles — triple the $60 million FirstEnergy used in a bribery scheme involving the passage of legislation in Ohio that in part aimed to prop up financially struggling nuclear power plants, according to the decision.

“These [$60 million in] funds represent an unnerving shadow over our regulatory role in this state and have harmed each and every consumer whose interests we aim to protect in proceedings before us,” the PUC said in its decision.

“Ohioans expect and deserve fair utility bills and utility companies that follow the law,” Maureen Willis, director of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, said in a statement. “Today’s PUCO order requiring fines, restitution and refunds is an important milestone in fixing the harms FirstEnergy caused.”

FirstEnergy spokeswoman Lauren Siburkis said the PUC’s decision “closes a chapter tied to activities that do not represent the company we are today. FirstEnergy is committed to accountability, transparency and rebuilding trust.”

“The Ohio companies remain focused on investing in the distribution system to enhance reliability and improve the customer experience for the benefit of more than two million customers in the state,” FirstEnergy said in an investor update on Thursday.

The sanctions create a near-term cash drag for FirstEnergy, but clears a major regulatory risk, according to equity analysts with Jefferies. “We believe this was the last remaining key item to close out this chapter of the company’s history,” they said Thursday.

Separately, the PUC approved a $34 million rate increase for FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities, down from a $190 million requested rate hike. It authorized a 9.63% return on equity compared to the utilities’ request for a 10.8% ROE.

“While the precise pacing of cash payments and bill credits will determine the short-term hit to credit metrics, we see the bigger implication as the removal of tail-risk around further PUCO monetary penalties and the establishment of a more predictable, if less generous, return framework that should allow [FirstEnergy] to keep funding Ohio grid and reliability capex within its broader regulated investment strategy,” the Jefferies analysts said.

In its decision related to the H.B 6 investigations, the PUC said FirstEnergy and its Ohio utilities have made “significant changes to instill a commitment to ongoing oversight and transparency, including the creation of the Office of Ethics and Compliance to institute and promote an appropriate culture and the implementation of several overarching policies to govern the relationships and interactions between FirstEnergy Corp. and its affiliates with those operating within the political and public spheres.”

FirstEnergy, based in Akron, Ohio, has already agreed to pay $390 million in other federal and state penalties related to the corruption scandal.

The search found that at least seven Republican lawmakers had rooftop panels. Three of them acknowledged using the federal tax credit to help pay for the arrays. One couldn’t recall. Another had leased a solar system that was indirectly subsidized via a separate tax credit for installers. And two other lawmakers didn’t respond to questions about their panels, which were on properties they had recently owned.

In addition to Calvert, the other Republican lawmakers who are known to have collected the residential solar credit are Sen. John Curtis of Utah and Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian who voted against Trump’s megalaw but said in an interview he supports rescinding the solar subsidy — and all tax credits. Curtis said Democrats and solar companies “knew that it was time for the subsidies to go.”

The revelations come at a time of rising utility rates and increasing politicization of energy as the Trump administration scraps grants, loans and permits for solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies. The president has dismissed solar panels as part of Democrats’ “green new scam” and called them “a blight on our country.”

Trump’s megalaw reinforced the partisan divide on energy. While the legislation primarily extended tax cuts passed in the president’s first term and provided $300 billion for border enforcement and military programs, it also slashed over $484 billion in clean energy incentives. Despite the megalaw’s deep cuts for climate programs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

The law was a double-whammy for the solar industry. It speeds up the phase-out of both the rooftop solar subsidy tapped by Calvert, Curtis and Massie as well as another credit relied on by project developers to cut the price of leased panels. At the same time, it boosted an oil subsidy created in the early 1900s and included other provisions to increase the production of fossil fuels that are primarily responsible for global warming.

“There has been a push, as you know, for a long while to get rid of those tax credits,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whose Capitol Hill rowhouse roof has been layered with solar panels for about a decade. “And then when you had Trump come into office, he made it very clear that this was not something that he was going to continue supporting.”

A key swing vote on the megalaw, Murkowski couldn’t recall if she received the credit, which can save homeowners thousands of dollars by refunding 30 percent of the cost of buying and installing panels. Analysts say almost everyone who buys a new solar system — the average cost of which is now about $30,000 — files for the benefit.

Rise and fall of solar subsidies

Congress first established a tax credit for some residential solar investments in 1978, but the subsidy expired in 1985.

The tax credit was revived in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 — a sweeping law signed by President George W. Bush that Murkowski and Calvert voted for at the time.

In the years since, the so-called residential clean energy credit has been extended and broadened in scope several times, most recently when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 with no Republican votes. The clean energy spending package would have allowed homeowners to claim tax credits of between 22 and 30 percent of the cost of qualifying solar, wind, geothermal and battery projects through 2034.

Then on July 4, Trump signed the megalaw that moved up the expiration of the residential clean energy credit by nearly a decade.

The legislation also accelerated the end of a 30 percent investment tax credit that’s used by solar installers to lower the cost of leasing panels for their customers. That solar credit will now largely disappear at the end of 2027, at least five years earlier than it would have.

New York Rep. Mike Lawler lives in a suburban home in the Hudson River Valley with rooftop panels that he leases from Vivint Solar. His district narrowly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, making him one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

Lawler was among a group of GOP lawmakers who repeatedly urged House leaders to protect clean energy subsidies when the party was overhauling the tax code this year. Those efforts were largely unsuccessful, and Lawler voted for the bill.

“We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we were able to keep a lot of the provisions and labor standards, etc.,” he said in an interview.

The panels on Lawler’s house have helped him avoid the impacts of rising electricity costs. Since he began leasing the solar system in 2016, it has saved him “a few thousand bucks,” he estimated.

“Look, they were going to expire,” Lawler said of the solar subsidies. “And it was phased out — a little more accelerated than some would like — but people are still able to utilize them.”

Lawler indirectly benefited from the investment tax credit, analysts say, because it helps companies reduce the costs their customers pay for leasing rooftop solar systems. After 2027, when the investment tax credit disappears, it could be harder for people to lease panels or buy electricity from community solar projects, according to Zoë Gaston, an analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

“Solar will definitely be more expensive,” she said. “It could be as much as a 30 percent increase. I know from talking to lots of installers that they’re trying to find other opportunities to cut costs.”

California Reps. Darrell Issa and Young Kim, both Republicans who voted for the megalaw, also had solar panels on homes they once owned. Public records show Issa sold his property last year. Kim transferred hers to a family trust in 2024 that now operates it as a rental property. She is facing a primary from Calvert.

Their offices did not respond to questions about whether the lawmakers had taken advantage of federal subsidies to purchase or lease the panels.

Dampening a solar boom

The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.

A renewable energy trade group estimated in 2004 that the nation installed enough panels that year to produce a total of 58 megawatts of power, enough for about 8,000 homes. Installations have exploded in popularity since then. Last year, the U.S. added over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity — 865 times higher than 2004 levels — with 4.8 GW of that annual growth coming from the residential sector alone, according to solar industry data. Seven percent of U.S. homes now have solar systems.

The megalaw is likely to blunt the solar boom as it amplifies other challenges facing the industry, such as high interest rates and Trump’s tariffs, according to analysts. Three large companies have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, with more expected to become insolvent in the coming months. Wood Mackenzie estimates that solar installations over the next decade would be 17 percent lower than it had previously forecast.

Curtis and Murkowski both argued that phasing out solar subsidies was necessary.

“I think universally, everybody — including our Democratic colleagues, including the industry — knew that it was time for the subsidies to go,” said Curtis, who along with Murkowski shaped the megalaw to make it slightly less difficult for companies to access the investment tax credit before it ends. “Nobody fought harder than I did for the off-ramp for those, because I felt like the off-ramp was appropriate.”

Democrats and solar companies disagreed with Curtis. Abigail Ross Hopper, the head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, warned on July 1 that the compromise legislation he and Murkowski had brokered “will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide.”

Curtis founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 while he was serving in the House. Two years later, he invited a climate media company to tour his home in Provo, Utah, where he showed off his solar panels and geothermal heat pump, while bragging about the hundreds of dollars per month they helped him save in energy costs. The panels and heat pump were both eligible for the residential tax credit he voted to terminate.

Back on Capitol Hill, Murkowski said her husband decided to install panels on their rowhouse about a decade ago. The senator, who once chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, couldn’t recall if they had filed for the federal tax credit.

“He was a real skeptic of solar and solar panels, more specifically, because he didn’t think that they were really going to make a difference for him as a consumer, as an individual,” Murkowski said, referring to her husband, Verne Martell.

What changed his mind, she said, was seeing the electricity savings of his then-87-year-old mother, who has solar panels on her home in Maui, Hawaii.

“It was an education for him that allowed him to do more research about how it might work in Washington, D.C.,” Murkowski said. “I do like the fact that our utility bills are really manageable now. And you know, it took a while, but it paid off.”

New fossil fuel subsidies

Republicans’ justification for killing rooftop solar credits are undercut by their continued support for incentives that go to the fossil fuel industry, argued Jesse Lee, a former senior adviser to the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.

“We’ve had subsidies and tax credits for oil production for more than a century. So I don’t really understand this argument that all clean energy tax credits must come to an end,” said Lee, who is now a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Climate Power.

“And not only did they leave the century-old oil industry subsidies untouched, they gave new tax loopholes to the oil industry,” he added. For instance, the megalaw established a 2.5 percent production tax credit for steel-making coal, cut royalty rates for coal mining and oil drilling on federal land, and eased restrictions on tax deductions for oil drilling costs — a subsidy that dates back to 1913.

Murkowski wasn’t comfortable with the megalaw’s energy contradictions.

“It’s kind of putting your finger on the scale, if you will, and picking winners and losers in the energy space,” she said. “I don’t think we should do that.”

But overall, she thought the bill was “more positive than negative in a lot of different areas,” she said. Murkowski was one of the final Republican holdouts on the bill, which passed the Senate with a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance.

Massie, whose Kentucky farmhouse appears to have more solar panels than the homes of his GOP colleagues, was one of only two House Republicans to oppose the megalaw. He voted against it because he thought the bill didn’t go far enough in cutting energy and health care subsidies.

“I would end all the tax credits. For everything,” said Massie, who earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has enough solar and battery systems to live off the grid. “I bought the bulk of mine before the federal tax credit.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd7%2F41%2Fb41a2dcd46419e20c32ff86c2217%2Fmain-ee-solarcredits-new.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:33.956543

A sprawling area of Richland Parish, once known for quiet fields, is now undergoing massive change after Meta broke ground on its $10 billion “Hyperion” data center.
This follows industry norms: “even large data centers generally employ less than 150 people,” leaving states with enormous costs per permanent job created.
Power demands from data centers are staggering.
More than half the energy powering U.S. data centers comes from fossil fuels, a footprint already resulting in “over 100 million tons of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere each year.” With new power plants being built specifically to serve future data centers, emissions are expected to soar.","Farmland in rural North Louisiana is rapidly transforming into one of the nation’s newest data center battlegrounds. A sprawling area of Richland Parish, once known for quiet fields, is now undergoing massive change after Meta broke ground on its $10 billion “Hyperion” data center. The influence has been immediate and dramatic. In a parish of just over 20,000 residents, “5,000 out-of-state construction workers are projected to be working here at the project’s peak.” The promise of jobs and new economic activity is enticing local leaders—yet policy experts warn states to tread carefully.

Meta didn’t choose Louisiana because of its culture, climate, or cuisine. As the author explains, “Louisiana gave Meta what it wanted in tax breaks.” In just weeks, state lawmakers altered a bill originally designed to support rural broadband rebates and instead tailored it to subsidize data center construction. The pivot was so abrupt that no financial impact assessment was produced. “No one knows how much this will cost the state,” the report notes, adding that neither residents nor legislators will learn the real amount of lost public revenue until Meta files for its sales tax rebates in future years.

Louisiana’s situation reflects a national trend. Governments across the country are racing to lure data centers from tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, often deploying massive subsidy packages without fully assessing long-term effects. According to a report cited in the article, “at least 10 states are already losing more than $100 million each in revenue a year from these tax breaks”—money that could otherwise support schools, infrastructure, and public services. The boom is fueled by AI technology, which requires exponentially more computing power. In fact, Texas “saw its annual cost estimates grow from $130 million to over $1 billion in the span of 23 months.”

Yet despite the public spending, data centers create strikingly few full-time jobs. Most positions are temporary construction roles. As the piece notes, “Meta, instead, is only required to create 500 full-time jobs by 2035 to receive the maximum amount of tax breaks.” Even as one of the world’s largest data centers, Hyperion’s workforce needs will remain modest. This follows industry norms: “even large data centers generally employ less than 150 people,” leaving states with enormous costs per permanent job created.

The public risks extend beyond tax revenue. Power demands from data centers are staggering. States often lack existing energy infrastructure and are forced to expand capacity for the sole benefit of a single corporation. In Louisiana, “Entergy is building three new gas-fired power plants just for Meta’s data center, which is projected to use more than three times the electricity of New Orleans on any given day.” Consumers, not tech giants, shoulder these utility costs. The report warns that residents elsewhere have faced electricity bill increases that “double and even triple over the last five years” in areas hosting large data centers. For regions like Richland Parish, “where 25 percent of people live below the poverty line,” such hikes could further push vulnerable households into hardship.

Environmental consequences are compounding concerns. More than half the energy powering U.S. data centers comes from fossil fuels, a footprint already resulting in “over 100 million tons of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere each year.” With new power plants being built specifically to serve future data centers, emissions are expected to soar. Water challenges are also growing, as these facilities require enormous volumes to cool servers, in some cases using “as much water as a small town.” These demands threaten water quality and availability for surrounding communities.

With billions flowing to some of the world’s richest corporations, policy experts argue that states must reconsider their approach. The author concludes that governments should halt subsidies and rethink priorities: “States need to put their own residents first to ensure that they’re protected from negative externalities of the data center industry.” Otherwise, they warn, states could ignite “a race to the bottom, draining revenues and pocketbooks.”

Data centers are undeniably crucial infrastructure for AI, cloud services, and modern computing, but policymakers face a complex trade-off. Subsidies meant to spur economic development may accelerate corporate growth while leaving taxpayers with infrastructure burdens, long-term expenses, and limited job opportunities. Experts suggest future incentives should be tied to local hiring, energy efficiency requirements, and transparent reporting to ensure benefits outweigh costs.",,N,,2025-11-20 14:04:38.548058

On 13 November 2025, the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag) passed an amendment to, inter alia, the Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz – “EnWG”) and the Federal Building Code (Baugesetzbuch – “BauGB”) which significantly simplifies the development of energy storage projects. The reform is intended to accelerate the expansion of storage facilities and thus create a central prerequisite for the energy transition. The following aspects are key from a developer and investor perspective.

What do I need to know?

Privileged permitting

The reform elevates legal certainty regarding the privileged treatment of thermal storage facilities, hydrogen storage facilities, and large-scale battery storage systems in outer areas (Außenbereich). By introducing no. 10 and 11 into section 35 BauGB, such projects are now expressly granted privileged status in the outer area.

From a permitting perspective this constitutes a major simplification of future permit procedures for such storage facilities. The legislator thereby addresses the practical reality that the implementation of such projects was previously subject to considerable legal uncertainty, resulting in significant delays in the permitting procedure. The explicit regulation ensures that the permissibility under planning law can now be determined promptly.

The amendment to the BauGB is complemented by an addition to section 11c EnWG. This provision clarifies that until the power supply in Germany is practically greenhouse gas neutral the accelerated expansion of energy storage facilities shall be regarded as a priority concern in the respective balancing of protected interests. This amendment constitutes an essential element in assessing the permissibility of storage facilities under the new concept of Section 35 BauGB and ensuring the effectiveness of the legislative reform.

Exemption from grid usage fee also for multi-use storage systems

The amendment act introduces one aspect in the context of this exemption which can be expected to facilitate the economic operation of so-called multi-use storage systems (e.g. BESS used as a buffer for a PV plant and for peak-shaving purposes): whilst the exemption so far applied to storage facilities if they use power from the grid (i.e. excluding multi-use systems), it will in the future apply also to multi-use systems to the extent they use power from the grid (section 118 para. 6 sentence 2 EnWG).

The current reform does not include an extension of the exemption for energy storage from the duty to pay grid usage fees which has been called for by industry players. The 20-year exemption therefore remains limited to energy storage projects commissioned by 4 August 2029 at this stage.

What should I do next?

The completion of the legislative process should be followed-up. Before the new rules become law, the Second Chamber of Parliament (Bundesrat) will decide on 21 November 2025 whether to raise an objection. Such an objection would not cause the Act to fail directly but it would prompt the Bundestag to reconsider the Act.

In addition to the changes through the current EnWG reform, stakeholders should follow-up on a potential legislative proposal by Federal Government on the power grid connection procedures, which Parliament asked Federal Government to present in the first quarter of 2026: such proposal should, in the Parliament’s view, fundamentally improve and digitise the grid connection procedure in the electricity grid for generation plants, consumers and storage facilities in order to increase transparency and planning security, to resolve the backlog of connection requests, particularly from large battery storage facilities, industrial customers and data centres, and to enable grid operators to deal with the acute situation of increasingly scarce grid connection capacities in a way that makes sense from an overall economic perspective.",,N,,2025-11-20 15:01:05.350004

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a broad package of federal spending and tax policies signed into law in July 2025, spells trouble for the residential solar industry. The law ends a large subsidy for residential consumers at year-end 2025.

It will also alter the broad distribution of tax benefits and the geographic dispersal of solar resources, though these changes will appear over time. While residential solar is very visible to the public, utility-scale solar dominates the overall market.

Tax subsidies supported solar expansion

Solar power’s expansion across much of the world coincided with government subsidies. Tax credits were the favored method of supporting solar energy in the U.S. Generally, an individual or business investing in solar energy could receive a tax credit equal to some percentage of the outlay.

The provision covered both residential installations and industrial development. After installing solar panels, residential consumers could claim a residential solar tax credit when they filed their taxes.

The residential solar tax credit is not new, and debate about the subsidy’s existence and its form have persisted since a Carter administration-backed measure created the first tax credit for solar system installation in 1978. The provision expired in 1985 under the Reagan administration and returned when President George W. Bush signed The Energy Policy Act into law nearly 20 years later, re-establishing the residential tax credit for solar energy.

It has endured in some form ever since, with extensions and marginal changes over the years. Under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, the residential credit for solar energy investment increased to 30 percent of qualified investment costs, up from 26 percent. The provision was to begin phasing out after 2032.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed within the first six months of the second Trump administration, removed tax credit eligibility for any system placed in service after Dec. 31. It will also mark the end of two decades during which a tax credit has been in place.

Residential solar credit often excludes low-income households

Although available to all households, solar tax credits don’t get much take-up among low-income households. The average cost of a household solar system is a little over $29,000. Assuming the installation fully qualifies for the 30 percent tax credit in 2025, the net-cost of the solar system would be roughly $20,000 ($29,000 sticker price minus the $8,700 credit).

Low-income households do not commonly have $29,000 in available cash (apart from the tax credit) for the up-front cost of installation. Even if they did, these households are more likely to rent rather than own their housing, which means they often do not have the option to install solar panels even if they had the money (Chart 1).

Thus, high income earners receive most of the benefit from the residential clean energy credit (Chart 2). Just under 1.25 million tax returns had residential energy credit attached in the 2023 tax year. The credit claimed that year totaled $6.3 billion.

About two-thirds of all credited dollars went to those reporting more than $100,000 in annual income. This group represents only around 24 percent of tax filers.

The form of the tax credit is another limiting factor for low-income households that might opt for a solar system. The credit is not fully refundable—that is, it cannot exceed the taxpayer’s annual tax liability.

The $8,700 solar tax credit in this example would exceed the annual tax bill for many low-income households. To obtain a credit, such a taxpayer would need to either spread the credit over several years or install a smaller system, lowering the present value of a full solar tax credit relative to an upper-income household that could take the entire credit at once.

Energy consumption skews toward high-incomes households

The distribution of energy consumption by income level often isn’t included in the analysis of who benefits from the residential energy tax credit.

While distribution of benefits from residential energy tax credits favors upper-income households, those groups also consume more energy than their low-income counterparts (Chart 3).

Insofar that reduced grid demand is a beneficial byproduct of residential solar systems, a policy whose distribution skews toward upper-income households might reduce grid stress more relative to a flat subsidy. However, solar panels also induce demand for energy consumption.

Solar panels, by subsidizing a household’s variable energy costs, incentivize those same households to consume more. This might come in the form of purchasing an electric vehicle or through other household electrification, such as switching to electric cook tops and heating or purchasing additional appliances. There is reason to believe that although residential solar has net-reduction effects on grid consumption, residential solar does not one-for-one displace grid consumption.

The raw distribution of residential tax credit masks its complicated effects. While high-income households disproportionately benefit from residential tax credits, they also disproportionately contribute to grid demand.

Residential consumption makes up small overall share

Even though residential solar installations might be the most visible form of solar energy, these systems contribute a small (and shrinking) fraction of solar investment.

The residential segment accounted for just more than 20 percent of solar installations in 2015. The share shrank to just over 17 percent in 2024. The decline reflects, in part, maturation and economies of scale for the solar industry, which has made utility-scale developments more competitive.

For example, a typical home solar system might have an 8 kilowatt to 12 kilowatt capacity, while a typical utility-scale solar farm of 150 megawatts is more than 10,000 times larger and is assembled at a steep per-unit discount on construction cost.

Residential solar also is not always the most economically efficient use of the marginal solar resource, since many areas in the country, such as Washington state, do not receive nearly the level of sun that Texas and Arizona do. The residential solar tax credit, by offering the same cost-based subsidy independent of geography, caused deployment of solar resources in suboptimal solar resource areas (Chart 4).

For instance, when a Seattle homeowner reviews the cost and benefit of a solar system, the subsidy significantly affects the break-even calculation. In a less subsidized environment, solar panels need to produce much more sunlight or utility savings to make sense for residential consumers. That is not always possible for someone living in a low-sunlight area such as Seattle.

Fewer home panels doesn’t mean less solar

While a full repeal of the residential energy tax credit likely leads to a decrease in residential installations, the growth of utility-scale projects will at least partially offset the impact, particularly with the future siting of marginal panels more likely in higher sunlight areas.

This moment of change in the solar industry will likely more progressively distribute benefits under the remaining tax credit system, all else equal. The residential share of development will shrink because of One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions.

However, utility-scale developers will have an easier time surviving the act’s impacts because of better project economics and a more favorable subsidy expiration schedule that in some cases runs until 2027.

Finally, the marginal solar resource will likely concentrate further toward areas of the country with greater sunlight. The lack of a broad subsidy will cause remaining developers and customers to tilt further toward the most solar-rich areas to get the most out of their panels.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Images/research/economics/2025/1120/neighborhood-solar-panels-pri.png,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:29.272463

Beyond equipment, Baker Hughes has also committed strategic capital, becoming an investor in the project — a move that signals confidence from one of the most established technology players in the global gas market.

The agreement was formalized during a high-level event in Washington, D.C., attended by federal officials including Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. Both emphasized the role of Alaska LNG in U.S. energy resilience and global energy strategy, positioning it as a project of both economic and geopolitical significance.

By integrating proven LNG technologies rather than introducing untested systems, Glenfarne reduces technical risk and advances toward final investment decision (FID) with a stronger platform. The company has already made notable progress since taking the lead in March, including early commercial traction with buyers across Asia — an area where shipping advantages could give Alaska a competitive edge over Gulf Coast terminals.

Two-Phase Strategy Sets Clear Path to Market

Glenfarne is pursuing a phased construction plan designed to move faster than previous attempts at development. In Phase One, an 807-mile, 42-inch natural gas pipeline would link Alaska’s North Slope resources to in-state users and the eventual LNG terminal. Final engineering and cost analysis from Worley are expected by December, with FID anticipated soon after.

Phase Two adds a full-scale liquefaction and export facility capable of shipping up to 20 million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG to international markets. That component is targeting a late-2026 FID. Glenfarne has already secured preliminary commitments from buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, which collectively represent over 60% of the volume needed to greenlight the project.

The structure aligns with evolving market realities, enabling capital deployment in stages and increasing project bankability. It also reflects Glenfarne’s broader LNG footprint across North America — including permitted sites in Louisiana and Texas — giving the company a diversified platform to serve global demand from multiple basins.",https://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/environment/original/20251114-090753-acd-getty-images-xQLb4F23jdM-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:03:53.561880

CleanTechnica is all for renewables and electrification.

We exist to remind humans of the Earth and to rid it of smoke belchers, offensive energy generation, and climate deniers. Idealistic as we are, we are also grounded in the truth that this will never happen quickly enough, and will happen mostly out of necessity.

And if you read the stories here, we question, oftentimes lambast, sometimes expose, but mostly praise and give credit where credit is due. I just have to say this to set the tone for this piece.

When I received the latest unaudited reports from VinFast last September, I asked them if I could get an audited report before I started writing my opinion on VinFast and where it is going—at least in the market where it intended to grow the fastest and the biggest—right here in the USA. Elsewhere in the world, they are seeping (that’s the word) into the market. Intentionally slow, I guess. But never overly cautious.

The reports never arrived, but that won’t stop a story. And it seems nothing will stop VinFast’s push into the US, a push recently highlighted by its aggressive presence at major events like the Electrify Expo, a vital step in re-establishing the brand after some missteps, which includes bad press on the VF8.

Now, I found two reasons to write this piece: 1) the residual value program the company is running in the Philippines and Indonesia; 2) and even more profoundly, space exploration.

Yes, VinGroup is now looking at the heavens for expansion, investing in a new company called VinSpace Joint Stock Company. According to Reuters, who broke the story, the new VND300 billion ($11,840,000) venture will be involved in space-related activities, specifically telecommunication satellite operations and scientific research.

Doesn’t that sound like burning cash?

Recently, CleanTechnica revisited their plant in Vietnam for the third time and compared notes between 2022 and 2025. There is great progress in manufacturing, research, and development back in Vietnam. This wasn’t just progress; it was transformative, at the very least.

Not financial advice

I am not a finance guy, so this story was developed with a lot of help from an auditor friend (whose name I cannot mention) to make me understand what the rows and columns of numbers imply. The numbers themselves were staggering, but two distinct impressions came to mind to me as a non-finance guy.

First, my thought is: this company is crazy. This level of financial risk is matched only by their history of audacity. I have covered the brand since 2017 when they held a contest to present to the Vietnamese people designs for the new national car, which was later to become the Lux A2.0 and Lux SA 2.0.

Imagine that. Instead of just getting a few heads together in the design phase, they elicited the help of the whole nation, with 60,000 citizens casting votes.

I realized that over time, the company was losing money at such a breathtaking pace that any other car company would have executives exiting or scrambling for solutions. VinFast executives seem to be sleeping just fine.

I asked a finance expert friend and journalist to tell me what the Vietnamese automaker’s latest unaudited financial report means. He said if we look at it historically, it is simply good investing. He pointed out how Tesla suffered losses too, both capital and operational. He framed the reports as a masterclass in strategic spending: take enormous losses now to dominate the global EV market later.

Wild, Wild East

The current numbers tell a wild story. (Note: not audited, not updated since September 10, 2025.)

VinFast delivered 72,167 EVs in the first half of 2025—a staggering 223% jump from the same period last year. Add in their e-scooters and e-bikes, and they’re moving serious volume: 114,484 two-wheelers delivered, up 447% year-over-year. Revenue hit $663 million in the second quarter alone, nearly doubling from last year. With 394 showrooms now spread across the globe, it’s the kind of operational breakthrough that should have investors celebrating.

The most recent press release said “VinFast continues to break records in the domestic automotive market by successfully delivering 20,380 electric cars of various models in October 2025, bringing the total number of VinFast vehicles delivered nationwide to 124,264 units in the first 10 months of the year.”

Those figures are real.

Crucially, many of those cars are “sales” to a related entity: the GSM taxi service—an enormously successful endeavor in the countries it has located in. While the money moves from one corporate pocket to another, it represents significant volume and real-world testing that boosts the delivery figures.

Instead, the bottom line looks like a financial disaster zone. But it that true?

Everything or nothing

But here’s the thing—this is pure Pham Nhat Vuong.

The billionaire chairman has made it crystal clear he’s willing to lose whatever it takes to make VinFast succeed. You don’t hear that from the overly cautious American car executive scared of the stock backlash of such an announcement.

Mother company VinGroup decides fast. And good son VinFast carries out the orders quickly. I was sitting in their Hanoi offices in 2022 when the memo went out: no more internal combustion engines. Period. While Tesla was the only major new-world automaker brave enough—or insane enough (like Nissan)—to bet everything on electric, here was a Vietnamese startup that had barely figured out conventional cars making the same all-or-nothing wager.

With Vuong on record saying he’ll burn through more money if necessary, those staggering quarterly losses start looking less like financial mismanagement and more like a deliberate war chest being deployed. Every dollar of loss is deliberate, part of a $2 billion gamble that most Americans will eventually buy cars from a brand they can’t pronounce. The company is torching cash on three massive fronts: building a network of shiny showrooms from California to Germany, launching marketing blitzes to convince skeptical buyers that “Vietnamese luxury EV” isn’t an oxymoron, and funding R&D labs working around the clock on next-generation vehicles.

“Live long and prosper”

The intentions behind VinSpace are probably the “highest” possible form of ambition. With Mr. Spock’s Vulcan salute, “live long and prosper.”

Down on Earth, its sprawling Hai Phong facility continues to churn out cars, while its American manufacturing intentions rising on a North Carolina farmland are temporarily on hold. This facility isn’t just a factory—it’s VinFast’s entire American dream materialized in steel and concrete. If it works, the company dodges crushing import tariffs and slashes shipping costs while planting a flag in the world’s most competitive car market.

It is here that the delays—seen as one of those much-lambasted missteps—took on a cosmic, almost divine meaning.

When Hurricane Helene devastated Western North Carolina in late 2024, the state’s infrastructure and construction environment ground to a halt. The VinFast site, though physically protected from the worst of the floods, was months away from significant vertical construction. Some internal observers must have quietly considered the delay an unexpected form of “divine providence,” sparing a multi-billion-dollar build from potential catastrophic disruption. If it doesn’t work, well, that’s a massive failure.

The brutal math is simple: VinFast is paying the astronomical (no pun intended) price of admission to play with Tesla, GM, and Ford. The company’s bet is that today’s financial bloodbath will look like pocket change once they’re manufacturing hundreds of thousands of EVs annually — whether that’s in Vietnam, Indonesia, India, or on good ol’ American soil.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VinFastEntrance-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 11:06:32.943048

At least 10 communities have been approached by data center developers, while utilities are quietly negotiating deals

Here’s how the industry might impact the environment, state revenues and power rates

Michigan is diving headlong into the national debate about hyperscale data centers as tech companies race to ink deals for land with ready access to electricity.

Developers are publicly pursuing projects in at least 10 Michigan communities — all in the Lower Peninsula — while others are in confidential negotiations to buy power from the state’s major electricity utilities.

The data center industry is expected to nearly triple by 2030, fueled by the growth of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Tech companies are racing to build facilities as soon as possible, often facing stiff resistance from local communities and worries about environmental impact.

“The scale of it is the biggest growth in electricity demand that we’ve seen since the 1970s, and maybe even faster than that,” said Douglas Jester, managing partner at the energy consulting firm 5 Lakes Energy. “It’s a big shock to how the power system and power system regulation works.”

So far, Michigan has none of the massive hyperscale data centers owned by the likes of Google, Microsoft and Meta. The state has 57 smaller data centers, according to the online database Data Center Map.

Michigan OKs landmark regulations that push up-front costs to data centers

But that could soon change. Oracle, OpenAI and Related Digital have cleared key land use hurdles needed to build a $7 billion data center campus in Saline Township, south of Ann Arbor. They expect to open the facility in 2027.

Here’s what to know as the industry makes inroads in Michigan:

What is a data center?

A data center is a building or buildings housing computer servers used to store, process or distribute vast quantities of data.

They can range in size, but much of the controversy surrounding data centers is focused on the massive so-called “hyperscale” facilities that tend to occupy hundreds of acres and gobble as much electricity as a large American city to fulfill the computing needs of giant tech firms like Google, Microsoft and Oracle.

The windowless, low-slung buildings resemble Amazon fulfillment centers from the outside. But inside, hundreds of thousands of computer servers operate around the clock, providing cloud storage of photos, videos and websites or training artificial intelligence models to write term papers and perform other computing tasks.

Why is Michigan suddenly seeing so much interest in building them?

Two words: Tax breaks.

Looking to tap into a global boom, Michigan lawmakers last year passed a law exempting large centers from the state’s 6% sales and use tax. To qualify, each data center operator must invest at least $250 million and create 30 jobs paying 150% of the local median wage.

The bill received bipartisan support and opposition, with advocates lauding the breaks as an economic development tool while skeptics decried them as “corporate welfare” projects that could hurt the environment.

The subsidies have functioned as intended, attracting a wave of interest from data center developers looking to do business in Michigan. At least 35 other states have or are considering similar incentives, according to one report.

“We only locate in states that recognize data centers as the modern-day equivalent or the successor to the manufacturing and agricultural and mining industries, which have always joined full sales tax exemptions on all the stuff they buy,” said Steve DelBianco, president and CEO of the tech industry group NetChoice.

Beyond tax breaks and friendly politics, developers look to do business in places with cheap, accessible land, water and electricity.

DelBianco said demand is so great that developers need to build a new hyperscale facility every week, but critics worry that artificial intelligence companies are overvalued and communities could get stuck with data centers that aren’t needed.

How many are planned and where?

Bridge Michigan has identified at least 10 communities in which developers have publicly unveiled hyperscale data center proposals in various stages of development.

It’s likely an incomplete tally — proposals often become public only after developers approach local officials seeking zoning changes or other needed approvals. That can be months after they have quietly secured land and electricity access.

It’s also unlikely every proposal will be built. For example, a plan in Monroe County’s Dundee Township is uncertain after public outcry prompted township officials to enact a moratorium on data center development. Another in Kalkaska County would rely on public land that state officials have said they have no desire to sell. A proposal in Kalamazoo County is also on hold after public pushback.

Still, the state’s major utilities anticipate multiple data centers coming online in Michigan in the coming years, in keeping with a nationwide trend.

Consumers officials are forecasting 2.65 gigawatts in new demand in the utility’s territory, while DTE officials are in late-stage negotiations for 3 gigawatts’ worth of data center capacity on top of the Saline Township proposal.

For perspective, the entire state of Michigan’s peak electrical demand is about 18 gigawatts. If all of that comes to fruition, Michigan’s peak energy demand could surge 39%.

Bridge Michigan polled the state’s other five investor-owned utilities on their projected data center power demand and none disclosed any pending deals.

How will they be powered?

If all that demand materializes, Michigan’s utilities would need to build more power plants or renewable energy arrays to keep up.

The Saline Township facility alone will demand 1.4 gigawatts, an amount equivalent to more than a million homes that will increase DTE’s system-wide demand by 25%.

DTE has said it can absorb that spike by ramping up production at existing power plants, plus buying power on the open market and building battery storage facilities that can be recharged during off-peak hours.

But long-term, both DTE and Consumers officials have said they’ll likely build new fossil fuel plants as they absorb new demand. The utilities insist they can do so while meeting Michigan’s 2040 deadline to achieve 100% clean energy, but have not provided specifics.

Spokespeople for both utilities said they will reveal further details next year, when they file what’s known as integrated resource plans with the Michigan Public Service Commission.

“We look forward to working with stakeholders and the Commission to chart the best path forward for our customers and the state,” DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said.

DelBianco, of NetChoice, said data center developers have a “preference” for clean energy but “speed to market is absolutely key.” Because wind and solar arrays are slower to build out, developers are turning to fossil fuels for now.

Michigan’s data center tax break law requires the facilities to get 90% of their electricity from clean energy within six years after being built. Environmentalists say they’ll be closely reviewing data center electricity contracts to make sure they comply.

Will they use lots of water?

Depending on the technology used to cool servers, data centers can consume vast quantities of water or relatively little.

Most data centers use evaporative cooling, a water-intensive process by which water vapor is used to cool equipment. That’s the plan for some of the proposed data centers in Michigan. In Augusta Township, for instance, the plan is to draw more than 1 million gallons daily from the local water utility. Local water officials say the system has plenty of excess capacity because of the 2010 closure of the Willow Run General Motors powertrain plant, which once demanded millions of gallons daily.

The Saline Township data center will instead rely on closed-loop technology in which cooling water is recycled through the system, reducing a facility’s water use to that of a typical office building.

The water savings come with a tradeoff: Closed loop cooling gobbles up more electricity because the cooling water must be repeatedly re-chilled.

How much money will taxpayers lose because of subsidies?

At least $90 million through 2050, according to a Senate Fiscal Agency analysis.

It’s likely much more than that, if Michigan’s experience is anything like that of other states with data center exemptions. In Illinois, for instance, a single Facebook data center has received $287 million in tax benefits in exchange for investing $4.6 billion.

Developers of the Saline Township data center have called it a $7 billion investment — an amount that would trigger some $420 million in tax exemptions if every invested dollar qualified for the subsidy.

Beyond the state-level exemptions, data center developers often seek local property tax breaks worth millions of dollars annually. The Saline Township facility, for example, will get a 50% discount on local taxes.

How do data centers affect electricity rates?

It depends how utilities structure their contracts with the new customers.

Historically, rising power demand has helped keep electricity rates down by creating more customers to help maintain the poles, wires and other fixed costs of the energy grid.

Done right, adding data centers to the system could have a similar effect, said Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps. But the sheer quantity of power they demand poses challenges because “we’re talking about gigawatt additions at a time.”

Transmission infrastructure for the Saline Township data center alone is projected to cost $500 million, according to figures DTE submitted to the Public Service Commission.

If Consumers Energy’s projected data center demand materializes, company officials anticipate transmission costs of up to $780 million.

Some studies claim data centers will increase power bills, while others have found the added load growth caused by data centers helps lower rates.

Jester said the impact on rates in Michigan will depend how utilities structure their contracts with data center developers.

State law requires data centers to absorb the cost of system upgrades meant to serve them so ratepayers don’t wind up subsidizing the industry’s hefty energy use.

In early November, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved a rate structure for data centers in Consumers Energy territory that aims to protect residents by locking data centers into long-term contracts and requiring Consumers to prove that the facilities will pay all costs for infrastructure that serves them.

That order doesn’t apply to DTE Energy, which wants to negotiate ad hoc contracts with customers.

It filed a draft 19-year contract for the Saline Township data center with state energy regulators this month and requested swift approval without a public hearing — prompting howls from environmentalists and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.

“Our energy future is far too important to leave to the rushed and secret negotiations of the companies standing to profit most from our ratepaying utility customers and the decisions of the MPSC,” Nessel said in a statement Tuesday.

How many jobs do they provide?

Despite their size, data centers typically provide few direct, permanent jobs. They function primarily as warehouses for computers, with little ongoing need for human labor.

Each facility in Michigan must employ at least 30 people to qualify for sales and use tax exemptions. Developers of the Saline Township data center have said they will hire 450 people.

But some corporations have a history of failing to deliver on promises, including data center developers.

Why do they all seem to be built on farmland?

For the same reason subdivisions, big box stores and factories keep popping up on farmland: It’s a cheap and easy place to build.

“It’s already cleared,” said Sarah Mills, a regional planner who directs the University of Michigan’s Center for EmPowering Communities. “That helps make development easy for anything.”

Hyperscale data centers, whose massive buildings are often the size of multiple football fields, have the added need for vast tracts of land.

But not all farmland is created equal: Developers tend to seek out properties adjacent to high-voltage power lines capable of transporting vast quantities of energy.

That’s also true for wind and solar developers, Mills noted, which is why “it’s some of the same communities that are getting approached for energy and for data centers.”

From Johnston County to Durham and Wake Counties, Mecklenberg County, and Gaston County, these projects will bring new manufacturing, life sciences, and finance jobs to the state — located in urban cores, as well as growing rural communities.

Vulcan Elements, a manufacturer of rare earth magnets, is creating 1,000 jobs and investing $918 million in the Johnston County community of Benson. The company’s 1 million-square-foot facility will become the largest magnet factory in the world outside of China, and will help the U.S. reshore this crucial component of the supply chain for many defense and commercial electronics.

North Carolina Governor Josh Stein announced the final site selection on November 19 at the Benson facility. “The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Gov. Stein. “With semiconductor chips, batteries, and now magnets, North Carolina is building an innovation and manufacturing hub that will drive the economy of the future.”

“North Carolina is a natural home for Vulcan Elements’ next stage,” said Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin. “We need to draw on world-class talent, innovation, and infrastructure as we secure one of the 21st century’s most important supply chains. As home to our current facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three. And as we create 1,000 new American jobs, we will tap into the region’s deep bench of experience across industries—from engineers and technicians who understand hardware and manufacturing to military veterans who have spent their careers managing complex supply chains, operating heavy machinery, and serving their country.”

The announcement follows Vulcan Elements’ $1.4 billion partnership with the United States Government to build a 100% vertically-integrated, domestic magnet supply chain with the company’s upstream partner ReElement Technologies. As United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick stated: “Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers. We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”

Maersk, FIT Precast, Aspida Financial Services & Novartis

Maersk, a global shipping company based in Copenhagen, Denmark, is creating 520 jobs and investing $16 million in Charlotte. The site will be home to the company’s North American headquarters. Maersk already has a sizable presence in Charlotte, and with this move, will eventually employ over 1,300 people in the Queen City.

Said Charles van der Steene, President, North America Region at Maersk, “We have substantially grown and transformed our North American business, and workforce, on our path to become an integrated logistics partner for our customers. As we looked to the future, we realized an official North American headquarters would allow us to even better serve our customers and continue to build a workplace where everyone can thrive. For more than two decades, we’ve built strong relationships and a solid foundation in Charlotte. We’re excited to deepen our roots in this vibrant community and in the North America region.

FIT Precast, an industrial concrete product manufacturer, is creating 125 jobs and investing $102 million in the Gaston County community of Gastonia. The company will build its headquarters and a concrete pipe production facility at the site, which will be the most advanced precast concrete manufacturing site in the U.S.

“The demand for resilient, American-made infrastructure has never been greater, and North Carolina is the ideal place to meet that challenge,” said Matt Goreski, President of FIT Precast. “This flagship headquarters and production facility is the most advanced precast concrete manufacturing site in the country; investing in both leading-edge technology and the people of North Carolina with high paying, meaningful careers. The Gaston County EDC and the State of North Carolina consistently went above and beyond to secure this project, we would like to thank them for making this our new home.”

Aspida Financial Services, a life insurance and annuity company, is creating 1,000 jobs and investing over $28 million in Durham County. The company will locate to the former IQVIA building along I-40 and make the location its headquarters. A member of Aspida Holdings Ltd, Aspida Financial Services was founded in 2020 and is based in Durham. The fast-growing financial services company has more than $25 billion in assets. “Aspida’s expansion in our home city of Durham reinforces our commitment to the local community, and to our continued growth in North Carolina,” said Lou Hensley, CEO and President of Aspida. “The Triangle’s support of business advancement, expanding infrastructure, and heavy focus on technology create the right environment for our quickly growing organization to thrive. We are excited to continue to support the community in which we work and live.”

“Aspida’s decision to scale its headquarters in Durham reflects the strength of our state’s talent pipeline and the collaborative spirit of our economic development partners,” said North Carolina Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “We look forward to supporting the growth of other home-grown North Carolina companies.”

Novartis, a life sciences company, is investing $771 million in three sites across Wake County and Durham County. The sites will house a small-molecule manufacturing facility, large-molecule manufacturing facility, and a fill-finish facility. Novartis, as part of an incentive agreement with the state of North Carolina, will create a total of 380 jobs across all three projects. However, the company anticipates exceeding that total and plans to hire upwards of 700 people at the three locations.

In the third quarter of 2025, clean energy and transportation investment in the United States totaled $75 billion, representing the highest quarter of investment on record. This growth, a 9% increase from the previous quarter and an 8% increase from the same period in 2024, was largely driven by unprecedented electric vehicle (EV) sales. Clean investment accounted for 5.3% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods, a new peak.

Retail consumer purchases of EVs and other clean technology (heat pumps, distributed generation, and storage) accounted for more than half of the total at $41 billion. This segment experienced a 19% increase quarter-on-quarter and a 17% increase compared to Q3 2024. By contrast, investments in clean energy technology manufacturing declined for a fourth consecutive quarter to $10 billion, representing a 10% decrease from the previous quarter and a 26% decrease compared to the same period last year. Investments in utility-scale clean electricity and industrial decarbonization technologies increased by 3% quarter-on-quarter to $25 billion, up 15% compared to Q3 2024.

The pipeline of new project announcements varied across segments. Utility-scale clean electricity announcements totaled $20 billion, mostly in solar and storage, up 1% relative to the previous quarter, but down by one-third from Q3 2024. New industrial decarbonization announcements totaled $3 billion, representing a 53% quarter-on-quarter increase but a 56% decline compared to Q3 2024. Developers canceled roughly $2 billion of investments in energy and industry projects this quarter, compared to $7 billion in cancellations during the previous quarter. In manufacturing, canceled projects also totaled $2 billion, less than half of the $5 billion in Q2 2025 cancellations. Announcements in manufacturing projects stood at roughly $6 billion, mostly driven by the EV supply chain, a 27% increase quarter-on-quarter, but a 9% drop relative to this same period last year.

In addition to summarizing trends from our quarterly update to the Clean Investment Monitor, this report also analyzes industrial decarbonization technologies, which lag in converting announcements into actual spending. Only $1 of every $10 announced in this sector—which includes hydrogen and carbon management—has been invested, compared to the roughly $6 of $10 actualized in both clean electricity and manufacturing. From Q1 2018 through Q3 2025, companies have canceled $17 billion worth of industrial decarbonization projects, exceeding the $15 billion invested over the same period in constructing and installing the 57 industrial decarbonization facilities that have begun operating in the US. Looking ahead, $136 billion in outstanding investment remains to be spent across 229 projects in the pipeline that have either not broken ground or are currently under construction. This report also offers a lens into how recently surfaced lists of Department of Energy grant terminations overlap with that pipeline of outstanding investment. We find $14 billion of outstanding investment in the industrial decarbonization sector is tied to projects with potential and confirmed award terminations, representing 10% of the total outstanding investment in the space. We provide a breakdown by technology.

Investment trends

Actual clean energy and transportation investment in the US in Q3 2025 reached a new record-high, totaling $75 billion (Figure 1). This surpasses the previous peak of $70 billion in Q3 2024 and marks a 9% increase quarter-on-quarter and an 8% increase compared to this same period last year. In Q3 2025, clean investment accounted for 5.3% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods nationwide, the highest share of investment on record, driven largely by a surge in EV sales (Figure 2).

We categorize our clean investment tracking into three segments: investment in the manufacture of GHG emission-reducing technology (“manufacturing”); investment in the deployment of that technology, both to produce clean energy or decarbonize industrial production (“energy and industry”); and investment through the purchase and installation of that technology by individual households and businesses (“retail”). Each dollar figure in this report reflects actual investment—the real dollars spent in the given quarter on retail purchases, facility construction, and equipment purchase and installation. For facilities, we track actual capital expenditures invested over the construction timeline once a project breaks ground. In the following sections of this report, we summarize actual and announced investments, which provide context and insight into potential future actual investments.

Retail investment accounted for 54% of total clean investment in Q3 2025 at $41 billion, with over three-fourths (76%) of spending in this segment attributed to EV sales. Actual retail investment increased 19% relative to the previous quarter, and 17% compared to Q2 2024. Manufacturing investment decreased for a fourth consecutive quarter to $10 billion, falling 10% quarter-on-quarter and down 26% compared to Q3 2024. In the energy and industry segment, $25 billion was invested in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization, a modest 3% increase from the previous quarter, and a 15% increase compared to Q3 2024. This quarter saw cancellations of $2 billion worth of investment in clean technology manufacturing projects, and another $2 billion in clean electricity and industrial decarbonization projects.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing investment dropped by 10% from Q2 2025 and declined 26% compared to Q3 2024. The EV supply chain—critical minerals, batteries, vehicle assembly, and charging equipment—remained the dominant force in clean manufacturing investment, accounting for $8 billion (83%) of the total $10 billion in actual investment (Figure 4). This level of EV supply chain investment reflects a 15% drop from Q2 2025 levels and 30% below the same period last year. Battery manufacturing investment fell by 23% quarter-on-quarter to $6 billion and declined a sizeable 37% relative to Q3 2024. Investment in solar manufacturing projects totaled around $2 billion in Q3 2025, up 34% from Q2 2025 and 6% from the same period last year.

Companies announced $6 billion in new manufacturing projects in Q3 2025, a 27% increase from the previous quarter but down 9% from Q3 2024, and representing the second-lowest quarter of announcements on record since Q2 2021, right behind Q2 2025. Most (99%) announcements in Q3 2025 were made in the EV supply chain, with $1 billion announced for batteries and close to $5 billion in EV projects.

During this period, companies canceled $2 billion worth of projects, the fourth-highest quarter on record after $2 billion of cancellations in Q3 2024, $5 billion in Q2 2025, and $7 billion in Q1 2025. Battery manufacturing made up most of the total cancellations for Q3 2025, while EV manufacturing projects drove most of last quarter’s cancellations.

Energy and industry

In Q3 2025, the US saw a total of $25 billion in actual investment in clean energy production and industrial decarbonization: up 3% quarter-on-quarter and up 15% relative to the same period in 2024. This represents the highest level of quarterly investment in this segment on record. Within energy and industry, most investment (96%) went towards clean electricity at an invested value of $24 billion, with the remaining $1 billion going towards industrial decarbonization projects.

Utility-scale solar and storage installations continued to dominate clean electricity investment, accounting for $17 billion, a 5% decrease from the previous quarter and a 3% decrease from this same period last year (Figure 5). In contrast, wind investment recorded a fifth consecutive quarterly increase, rising by 31% from the previous quarter to $7 billion in Q3 2025, marking the highest quarter of investment since 2020.

‍

Industrial decarbonization investment declined 12% quarter-on-quarter and 23% relative to Q3 2024 (Figure 6). Hydrogen continues to lead actual investment in industry at $465 million, down 8% from the previous quarter and 12% compared to Q3 2024. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investment dropped to $152 million, a 22% decline quarter-on-quarter and a sizeable 62% dip compared to Q3 2024. Carbon management investment was down 22% from the previous quarter, to $123 million. Clean fuels saw $87 million of investment, and $74 million was invested in clean iron and steel production, roughly on par with the level of investment in both technologies during the previous quarter.

‍

The pipeline of new energy projects expanded slightly in Q3 2025, with the addition of $20 billion in new utility electricity project announcements, representing a 1% increase from the previous quarter but down by one-third from the same period last year. Most (96%) of these announcements continue to be from solar and storage.

Industry announcements totaled $3 billion, representing a 53% increase compared to the previous quarter, but still down 56% relative to Q3 2024. So far in 2025, companies have announced $2 billion of investment each quarter, on average, a stark difference from the $8 billion quarterly average level of announcements in 2024 and $10 billion in 2023. We focus here on averages to provide clarity on the annual momentum for US industrial decarbonization projects.

Cancellations across the energy and industry segment reached $2 billion this quarter, down 73% from the previous quarter, but up 22% compared to Q3 2024. Solar, storage, and hydrogen cancellations contributed most to this total.

Retail

Consumer spending on zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), distributed renewable electricity generation and storage, and heat pumps totaled $41 billion in Q3 2025, a new record high quarter. This level of spending represents a 19% increase from Q2 2025, and a 17% increase from the previous peak of $35 billion in Q3 2024.

Investments in ZEVs drove this surge, reaching $31 billion—a record uptick in ZEV sales at a 32% increase from the previous quarter and 30% from the same period last year. This quarter, capped by the September 30 sunset of EV consumer tax credits, marks a new record high for investment in ZEVs (Figure 7).

Distributed electricity generation and storage investment fell 4% from the previous quarter and down 5% compared to Q3 2024, totaling $4 billion in investment. This marks the second consecutive quarter of decline. Investments in heat pumps, which stood at $6 billion, declined both quarter-on-quarter and relative to Q3 2024, by 15% and 17%, respectively. Consumer tax credits to support the purchase and installation of these technologies also expire at the end of this year.

Assessing industrial decarbonization investments amid DOE funding turbulence

The Clean Investment Monitor tracks investment since 2018 in emerging climate technologies—hydrogen, SAF, other clean fuels, carbon management, and new approaches to decarbonizing the production of cement, iron and steel, and pulp and paper—that aim to reduce industry emissions, the second highest-emitting sector in the US. From the start of 2018 through Q3 2025 (September 30, 2025), companies have invested $15 billion in constructing and installing new industrial decarbonization facilities, and 57 projects have started operating across the country. Looking ahead, $136 billion of outstanding investment remains to be spent on 229 announced projects that have not yet broken ground or are currently under construction. This pipeline excludes $17 billion worth of projects that have been canceled, underscoring the headwinds facing these early-stage technologies.

Compared to clean electricity investment—also captured within the Clean Investment Monitor’s energy and industry segment—industrial decarbonization lags in converting announcements into spending. Only $1 of every $10 announced since Q1 2018 has been invested as of Q3 2025, significantly less than the roughly $6 in every $10 that has been actualized in both clean electricity and manufacturing projects we track. This low ratio of investment relates to the early-stage nature of many industrial decarbonization technologies, which are generally dependent on a mix of external public and private funding, as well as policy initiatives to facilitate commercialization, and often contingent on securing offtake agreements for their product.

Recent turbulence in federal funding awards from the Department of Energy (DOE), particularly through the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, could further complicate industrial decarbonization—especially for the 64% of projects that have not yet broken ground. In October 2025, DOE announced nearly $8 billion in funding terminations for more than 200 energy projects, revoking over 300 awards. Days later, an unconfirmed list detailing these and additional grant terminations circulated on Capitol Hill. These actions follow $4 billion in funding terminations announced in May 2025 for 24 clean energy grants. Though not all the projects appearing on these lists fall within the Clean Investment Monitor’s scope of coverage, we cross-walked the available information with our database to identify industrial decarbonization projects subject to potential or confirmed termination of DOE awards. We find $14 billion in outstanding investment is tied to the projects included on those award termination lists, representing 10% of the outstanding industrial decarbonization investment, and spread unevenly across technologies (Figure 8).

First-of-a-kind facilities aiming to produce decarbonized cement and pulp & paper appear to be most exposed to the DOE award terminations. For cement, projects appearing on the award termination lists account for roughly $2 billion of total announced investment—representing about 93% of the sector overall and 99% of outstanding investment. The single announced US facility for producing decarbonized pulp and paper also appeared on an award termination list, thus representing 100% of outstanding investment in this nascent space. Low-carbon iron and steel, by contrast, is further along in terms of actualized investment, with 86% of the $4 billion announced projects already invested since 2018. None of the remaining outstanding investment is tied to the award termination lists.

In carbon management, which includes direct air capture, point-source capture in the power sector, and carbon dioxide utilization and removal, only 5% of the total $29 billion announced in this sector since 2018 has been invested, leaving 95% of the investment outstanding. Projects tied to $7 billion of outstanding investment, almost one-fourth of the yet-to-be-realized $28 billion in spending, appeared on the award termination lists.

Hydrogen projects tracked by the Clean Investment Monitor include both green hydrogen produced with electrolyzers powered by clean electricity and blue hydrogen production that integrates carbon capture, which together have attracted more than $61 billion of announced investment since 2018. Companies have canceled more than $7 billion of projects, including some that were already under construction, while $5 billion has been invested, primarily in green hydrogen. Another $50 billion remains outstanding across all hydrogen projects. Several hydrogen-production facilities in our tracking are associated with seven hydrogen hubs that have appeared on the award termination lists. Collectively, these account for $5 billion or 9% of the outstanding investment in hydrogen as of Q3 2025.

SAF and other clean fuels projects stand out as sectors that did not appear on the award termination lists. SAF, produced through various production processes from waste-derived feedstocks, accounts for 30% of all industrial decarbonization investment, at around $4 billion. Still, 92%, or $53 billion, of announced SAF investment remains outstanding as of Q3 2025. Clean fuels, including ethanol produced with carbon capture, have a narrower pipeline of $2 billion in outstanding investment, equivalent to 88% of announcements in this technology since 2018.

In Q4, we will be monitoring the impact of the DOE award terminations and changes to tax incentives enacted under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on the industrial decarbonization landscape. Many projects rely on complex funding arrangements that include federal cost-sharing combined with state or municipal support, equity investors, and long-term offtake agreements. Early signals of the ripple effect from federal award terminations would include construction pauses, revisions to project timelines, or private-sector partnerships emerging to fill funding gaps.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64e31ae6c5fd44b10ff405a7/691e1686564fc96982dc1d1e_hydrogen.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:02:04.911543

Federal energy policy has been the subject of such rancorous political debate that fossil fuels, renewable energy and electric vehicles have become part of the culture wars dividing people across the United States.

But while the federal government continues picking winners and losers among energy technologies, Texas demonstrates an affordable and reliable path to achieving American energy resilience that repeatedly prioritizes practicality over ideology.

To be certain, the state has had its fair share of reliability challenges in recent years, and extreme weather will continue to be a risk to our energy infrastructure. But Texas is blessed with tremendous natural gas, wind and solar resources, and embracing these with an all-of-the-above strategy has kept the state’s electricity prices affordable in recent years. Equally important, Texas has shown that resources must stand on their own economic merits. If they don’t deliver affordable, reliable energy in practice — not just on paper — they don’t scale here.

Electricity rates for residential and business customers in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are 24% lower than the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That won’t seem low enough to Texan households struggling to pay bills, but rates would be substantially higher without the solar power and energy storage capacity brought online here in recent years. We’ve seen the results of this development in the AI-powered wholesale price forecasts we produce for ERCOT.

Amperon’s data shows that both day ahead and real time market prices have trended down significantly over the last four years as ERCOT’s solar capacity has increased by more than 200%.

With no fuel costs, solar operates at a low marginal cost, pushing market prices down. Thanks to ERCOT’s competitive market structure, wholesale cost savings make their way not just to investors but also to customers.

The dynamics are the same for wind power, but the development of new wind generation hasn’t moved as quickly as solar has in recent years. Combined, though, wind and solar can now supply up to nearly half of ERCOT’s total electricity demand, which makes the market less reactive to increases in the cost of natural gas. The rapid installation of battery storage is also expanding the impact of low-cost renewables by storing and discharging excess generation during other times of high demand.

But affordability isn’t just about wholesale market dynamics; it’s also about designing rules that incentivize the right behaviors for consumers.

In Houston, for example, many retail providers offer free power at night or on weekends, which encourages customers to shift usage when the grid has excess supply. Programs like smart EV charging reward Texans for plugging in cars when it makes the most sense for the grid and their pocketbooks. These are the kinds of consumer-friendly market rules that keep our system efficient, innovative and fair.

Unfortunately, when it comes to affordability, this may be about as good as it gets. Energy Innovation, one of the many research groups modeling the economic impacts of recent federal legislation, projects the unwinding of tax credits for carbon-neutral generation will keep Texas from gaining another 77 GW of solar and wind power, which is almost equivalent to the entire state’s current peak demand on hot summer days.

Without new solar and wind, projected increases in future demand will have to be met by running existing thermal generation, which will put upward pressure on market prices. Although one could argue that if prices go up as much as Energy Innovation predicts (up to 54% for residential and business customers), the data centers and other commercial enterprises expected to arrive in the state won’t ever come.

The sudden policy swing isn’t just about affordability and economic growth though, because diverse electricity generation also makes ERCOT more resilient. The combination of natural gas, wind, solar and batteries (not to mention nuclear and hydro) keeps the power grid from being overly dependent on any single type of generation. For example, in late July, 5,019 MW of coal-fired generation went offline without causing an emergency.

Diversification creates the flexibility to absorb future disruptions in fuel supply too, and it decentralizes the entire system, making it less vulnerable to the kind of widespread outage that happened with Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

Texas is also paving the way for next-generation nuclear power with several small modular reactor projects greenlit, supported in part by the state’s newly created Texas Energy Fund. Nuclear won’t be the largest source anytime soon, but it adds a stable, carbon-free option to the state’s diversified mix.

Integrating large amounts of solar and wind was always going to require a period of operational adjustment, especially until the system had enough battery capacity to respond rapidly to unexpected mismatches in supply and demand. But this combination of new solar and battery capacity is why there were no Energy Emergency Alerts in 2024, despite “extended high summer peak periods,” according to the recent Assessment of Reliability Performance report published by TexasRE. The assessment also found the chance of rolling blackouts this summer is just 0.3% — down from 12% last summer (when, it should be noted, there were no blackouts).

Regardless of what’s being said at the national level, we know from watching the Texas market closely that ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas was right when he told a House Committee meeting earlier this year that “the market, as structured today, is very well suited to support the growth trajectories that we’re seeing increase in the state of Texas.”

Texas boasts a competitive marketplace with low barriers to entry, renewable energy zones for easier planning and non-partisan energy debates that have helped keep industry-friendly regulations in place. These policies and diverse generation sources absolutely affect the day-to-day market prices we forecast and track.

In short, the highly politicized national energy debates are missing the point. It’s not about ideology; it’s about doing what works. And what works in Texas is competition, consumer choice and resources that prove their worth economically. If we continue to let data — not dogma — drive energy decisions here, Texas will be fine, and we might just show the rest of the country a thing or two in the process.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4KExPXRr_eBX86TwFqNBh396fRG4wo1jZOT81i82b7U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzAzMzk3NDc2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-20 11:05:45.145860

The strange thing is that a host of Trump’s tariffs have nothing to do with those two, sometimes-acceptable objectives.
This is true, without question, with regard to large tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year on imported coffee.
Still, American consumers love coffee, and they clearly resent the 19% single-year price hike on coffee caused almost entirely by Trump’s tariffs.
In 2024, before the Trump coffee tariffs took effect, coffee was, by value, the fourth largest item imported in New Orleans, at slightly more than $1 billion.","President Donald Trump is spectacularly mercurial in economic policy decisions, but for now, Louisiana is benefiting from his latest policy effusions.

Indeed, the state's economy received two major boosts from the Trump administration in the past 10 days, one related to coffee and one to energy production — although the first boost stems from Trump reversing one of his own, misbegotten policies.

The policy reversal involves Trump’s bizarre fetish for import tariffs. Every observer with an ounce of sense recognized that at least in the near term, U.S. consumer prices would rise on just about every good or item subject to higher tariffs. Trump all along has insisted that foreigners, not Americans, actually pay tariffs, but of course, that’s just factually incorrect. Now, though, with the average U.S. family paying $700 more so far this year for “basic” items, a recent poll shows the public largely blaming the tariffs, of which the public disapproves by a nearly two-to-one margin. The public is right. From a standpoint of basic economics, most of Trump’s tariffs make no sense.

Granted, there can be two arguably good reasons for tariffs. One is to punish an unambiguous adversary by deterring demand from the otherwise large U.S. market for the adversary’s products. Even then, though, it helps to acknowledge that U.S. consumers are taking a hit in the name of the nation’s greater good.

The second reason that sometimes holds true, although nowhere near as often as tariff supporters insist, is to bolster a domestic industry whose very existence is crucial for national security in case, Lord forbid, of a major war.

The strange thing is that a host of Trump’s tariffs have nothing to do with those two, sometimes-acceptable objectives. This is true, without question, with regard to large tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year on imported coffee. Coffee surely is not an essential element of our national security apparatus, and the mainland U.S. features almost no domestic coffee production to protect anyway. Almost nowhere in the country’s mainland is the climate right for growing the stuff.

Still, American consumers love coffee, and they clearly resent the 19% single-year price hike on coffee caused almost entirely by Trump’s tariffs.

That’s why, as a clear political necessity, Trump on Nov. 14 abandoned his tariffs on coffee, along with those on bananas, tomatoes and other foods used almost everyday in American home kitchens.

The removal of the coffee tariffs is doubly good news for Louisiana. Not only are Louisiana consumers likely to pay less for our cups of joe going forward, but our job base should benefit significantly.

This newspaper in the past eight months has featured a number of news and opinion pieces highlighting the importance of the coffee trade in Louisiana, along with the damage done to it by the tariffs. Coffee comes through several Louisiana ports and is an especially important commodity at the Port of New Orleans. In 2024, before the Trump coffee tariffs took effect, coffee was, by value, the fourth largest item imported in New Orleans, at slightly more than $1 billion.

In turn, coffee distributors and roasters here provide thousands of direct jobs in Louisiana (1,600 in coffee production alone, not to mention retail positions), and of course, coffee plays a huge role in the state’s dining scene that is a keystone of the tourism industry.

Trump’s reversal, therefore, is great news for the Bayou State.

Meanwhile, Trump needed no reversal in policies in order to help Louisiana’s oil and gas industry. He has always been strongly pro-oil exploration. On Nov. 11, that inclination bore fruit as the administration released a call for energy-company bids for some 80 million acres in the central and western Gulf. The leases, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, result largely from new policies adopted in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act Trump pushed through Congress with a major assist from House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, both of Louisiana.

Even better, that same bill raises the amount of revenue from Gulf leases that flows directly to four coastal states, with Louisiana likely to get an extra $46 million per year. Combined with the added jobs from the new leases and related businesses that service the oil industry, and the tax revenues produced from those, this is obviously a considerable windfall for the whole state.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/30/0305e0e9-4930-537e-829b-0154c7979194/691246a740be0.image.jpg?crop=1661%2C872%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-20 17:02:01.634788

Ohioans and Environmental Organizations File Lawsuit Challenging Constitutionality of Air Pollution Amendment in State Budget

Columbus, OH — On Thursday, October 30th, the Ohio Environmental Council, Sierra Club, SOBE Concerned Citizens, Donna Ballinger, and the Freshwater Accountability Project filed a lawsuit against the State of Ohio and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Their complaint alleges that select sections of H.B. 96, Ohio’s state budget passed this summer, violate the One-Subject Rule of the Ohio Constitution.

The Ohio General Assembly snuck anti-environment provisions into H.B. 96 at the last minute that removed important protections for Ohioans who want to file complaints against polluters while taking away Ohioans’ ability to protect themselves using community air monitoring data. These statutory changes have no relationship to Ohio’s budget and thus violate the Ohio Constitution’s requirement that all legislation include only one subject.

Key Facts about the Unconstitutional Provisions

H.B. 96 created R.C. 3704.0310, which requires the Ohio EPA to repeal the Air Nuisance Rule provisions of its Clean Air Act State Implementation Plan.

The Air Nuisance Rule has historically provided an enforcement mechanism for Ohioans to hold polluters accountable for their nuisance pollution impacting fenceline communities.

H.B. 96 also amended R.C. 3704.01, among other provisions, prohibiting the Ohio EPA from relying on “community air monitoring,” data collected by community members using community air monitors installed throughout their community to protect them from air pollution.

Together, these provisions form the Air Pollution Amendment to H.B. 96, which does not include any appropriations or language relevant to Ohio’s state budget.

Counsel from the Case Western Reserve University Environmental Law Clinic, AltmanNewman, Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services, and the Ohio Environmental Council represent the parties.

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Neil Waggoner, Midwest Beyond Coal Campaign Manager for the Sierra Club:

“Ohio’s Air Nuisance Rule has been a critical tool for the public to hold polluters accountable for decades. There has been strong opposition to efforts to roll this rule back for years, which might be part of the reason why the legislature snuck it into the budget bill and conducted no public debate on their scheme. The legislature’s action was not just a violation of the single subject rule; it’s a violation of the public trust and seeks to further violate our rights to take action to protect our communities from polluters.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services:

“At Fair Shake, we believe that everyone should have the right to make decisions about the air, water, and land where they live. This unconstitutional attack attempts to strip Ohioans of their ability to hold polluters accountable through public monitoring and the courts. That is why we are proud to join this lawsuit alongside the Case Western Environmental Law Clinic, the Ohio Environmental Council, and Altman Newman.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Leatra Harper on behalf of Freshwater Accountability:

“At the behest of industry, the Ohio legislature took away the Air Nuisance Rule that has been available for over fifty years to residents seeking protection from harmful air pollution. The people need this rule, and its removal harms the ability of everyday Ohioans to protect themselves from toxic air pollution. This is another example of some legislators in Ohio caring more about protecting polluters than protecting Ohioans.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Lynn Anderson on behalf of SOBE Concerned Citizens:

“The Ohio legislature needs to provide stronger protections for the citizens of Ohio against toxic air pollution in the form of stricter regulation, monitoring, and remediation. By taking away the Air Nuisance Rule and community monitoring provisions, however, they are weakening our existing protections and leaving Ohio communities harmed by toxic air pollution behind.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Dave Altman of AltmanNewman Co. LPA:

“If this illegal action by the State is not corrected, you will still be free to defend your property with firearms, but not with air monitors.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Chris Tavenor, General Counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council (OEC):

“The Ohio General Assembly has once again violated the Ohio Constitution by slipping substantive provisions into its budget bill that have nothing to do with the state budget. This action, on its own, needs to be called out as unconstitutional. But the impact it has on Ohioans seeking to protect their communities from air pollution is just as harmful. The General Assembly should be applauding Ohioans who gather data about air pollution and use it to hold polluters accountable, rather than punishing them.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Miranda Leppla, Director of Case Western Reserve University Environmental Law Clinic:

“Everyday Ohioans merely trying to protect themselves and their loved ones from dangerous air pollution have been robbed of the ability to do so through a violation of a basic tenant of Ohio’s Constitution—that Ohioans should be able to advocate for or against legislation that they care about. These Plaintiffs aim to restore Ohioans’ ability to remedy air pollution impacting their families and to remind the Ohio Legislature that they serve the people, not polluters.”

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-20 15:01:44+00:00,News From The States,"Energy-rich Campbell County wants nuclear, but not its radioactive waste",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/energy-rich-campbell-county-wants-nuclear-not-its-radioactive-waste,"The Campbell County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution Tuesday stating the body will not support storing nuclear waste locally.
That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage.
While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler.
Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming.
“It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste.","Top officials in one of the nation’s most energy-prolific counties — home to uranium mining, oil, natural gas and the most productive coal-mining district in North America — are cautiously supportive of the nuclear energy industry’s burgeoning interest in northeast Wyoming.

But they don’t want its radioactive waste.

The Campbell County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution Tuesday stating the body will not support storing nuclear waste locally. That’s in line with state law, which currently prohibits nuclear waste storage. In anticipation that could change, the Campbell County resolution urges state lawmakers to allow “citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”

The five-member commission voted 4-1 in favor of the position, with Commissioner Jim Ford casting the single “no” vote. The county solicited public input on the matter for several weeks and redrafted the resolution multiple times, most recently during a Nov. 13 workshop. Commissioner Jerry Means said he proposed the resolution amid growing interest in Wyoming from nuclear energy companies, as well as often intense public debate about nuclear energy’s risks and benefits.

Opponents of the resolution, before and after Tuesday’s vote, warned it may send a signal to the industry, and to BWXT in particular, that it is not welcome in the community. While the company’s proposal to build a nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Campbell County does not involve radioactive waste or storing such materials, nuclear energy companies are sensitive to local opposition, according to Gillette-based L&H Industrial President Mike Wandler. He’s frequently credited for the industry’s recent interest in setting up manufacturing shops in Wyoming.

“So any resolutions against nuclear, they’re going to take very seriously,” Wandler recently told WyoFile. “They’re just going to go away and find someplace else to bring those jobs and to bring that revenue.”

Wandler and other nuclear energy industry supporters note that people sometimes conflate BWXT’s plans in Campbell County with a different proposal in Natrona County. Radiant Industries, unlike BWXT, did include storing spent nuclear fuel, but the California-based company scrapped its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in October. The company cited a lack of “regulatory certainty” about whether the state would further loosen its ban on nuclear fuel waste storage — a key change in law needed to accommodate Radiant’s plan to store spent fuel from its microreactors at a campus outside the town of Bar Nunn.

Reached for comment after the resolution was passed, BWXT said it isn’t shying away from Campbell County.

“The resolution does not impact our proposed plans for a TRISO fuel fabrication facility in Gillette as our facility will neither create nor store high-level nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel,” BWXT Advanced Nuclear Fuels Senior Director Josh Parker told WyoFile via email.

Meantime, some in favor of the resolution noted previous legislative attempts to allow spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming. Industry skeptics have also expressed fears that the federal government might force either an interim or permanent storage facility in a community that doesn’t want it.

“We all know laws can be changed every year,” Means said. “So this is basically getting out ahead of what I see for the future for Campbell County, because I do see people in our county, right here, [who] think that maybe we need to accept nuclear waste.”

The resolution

The commission’s 2-page resolution declared adherence to “the following guidelines regarding nuclear waste storage in Campbell County.”

No interim nuclear storage — domestically produced or relocated;

No consolidated interim storage — domestically produced or relocated;

No deep geological repository (caverns);

No deep geological repository (bore hole);

No exemptions granted for interim or consolidated storage, or geological repositories.

But what authorities or policy tools the county might use to enforce the guidelines are unclear.

According to the resolution, the commission “supports the development and siting of the nuclear industry in Campbell County, if such facilities do not produce, receive, or store nuclear waste, except what is currently permitted by Wyoming law as of the date of this resolution.”

“We can’t override the state or the federal government,” Means told WyoFile. “It basically lets the community know that, as commissioners, we choose not to accept nuclear waste and spent fuel from [the nation’s] legacy waste. It really has no [legal] backbone.”

It also notes that “current Wyoming law does not allow for the people to vote on the specific issue of nuclear waste storage,” and resolves that “the Campbell County Board of Commissioners supports any change in state law that would allow citizens to vote on the matter of high-level nuclear waste storage.”

Though several Wyoming lawmakers suspect there will be another attempt in the upcoming budget session to crack the door open wider for nuclear waste storage, it’s unclear whether there might be forthcoming legislation to allow for some kind of public referendum on the issue.

“Our resolution essentially says that, ‘Yeah, the Legislature should change the law to allow the citizens to vote on the issue,'” Commissioner Scott Clem, a former Wyoming representative, told WyoFile.

Radiant fallout

While opponents cheered Radiant’s pullout from Natrona County, the move shook many in the business community, particularly at the state level.

Gov. Mark Gordon pinned the blame on the far right of the Wyoming GOP.

“Members of the Freedom Caucus inspired ‘Club No’ convinced Radiant that Wyoming isn’t about leadership and problem solving,” Gordon said in a prepared statement in October. “‘Club No,’” he continued, “has ushered in a new culture of no matter who began or who commenced it, we’re against it. That is not the way Wyoming became the great state it is.”

Though it was not directly part of the Governor’s Business Forum agenda last week in Laramie, Radiant’s exit was a topic of discussion in the hallways and sometimes on the stage.

Many attendees “[are] mad about a certain project in the Natrona County area,” Wyoming Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell told the audience of about 500. “Why did we lose that? Because the vocal minority.”

For its part, the business council is ramping up efforts to garner support for nuclear energy development in Wyoming, according to Dorrell, both in general and for BWXT’s project in Campbell County, in particular.

The state is putting its financial might behind the project as well.

The Wyoming Energy Authority has recommended a $100 million state grant to support BWXT’s TRISO fuel manufacturing project. The grant, if approved by Gordon, would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/camc011763653428.jpg?h=29234840&itok=wn46FwXC,N,,2025-11-20 11:03:52.750673

“The grid resiliency investments will reduce outages and lead to faster restoration times,” said Andre Guillory, chief customer officer for Cleco.
In 2026, grid resiliency efforts will commence and further strengthen systemwide resilience, reduce storm-related costs, lead to fewer outages and faster restoration times, and result in over $400 million in value for Cleco customers.
“Every dollar invested in grid resilience delivers double the value or savings back to customers,” said Guillory.
“We thank our regulators, the Louisiana Public Service Commission, for their support and forward-thinking approach to investing in our infrastructure, customers and communities.”","The Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) unanimously approved the largest single grid resiliency investment in Cleco’s history.

Following LPSC approval, Cleco will finalize and begin executing its five-year resiliency plan which will include over 550 projects that harden grid infrastructure by replacing electric equipment, undergrounding certain segments of the system, reinforcing utility poles and elevating substations above flood plains.

“The grid resiliency investments will reduce outages and lead to faster restoration times,” said Andre Guillory, chief customer officer for Cleco. “Additionally, a portion of the projects are focused on critical customers, like hospitals and emergency services. This work will enhance and protect vulnerable communities, first responders and critical services which are essential during storms or times of crisis.”

Last year, Cleco began a six-year initiative to nearly double the clearing of hazardous vegetation to reduce the occurrence and duration of power outages. In 2026, grid resiliency efforts will commence and further strengthen systemwide resilience, reduce storm-related costs, lead to fewer outages and faster restoration times, and result in over $400 million in value for Cleco customers.

“Every dollar invested in grid resilience delivers double the value or savings back to customers,” said Guillory. “In addition, a stronger, more resilient grid will help attract more business, jobs and economic opportunities for our Louisiana communities.”

Cleco is the only Louisiana utility to meet or exceed LPSC reliability standards for each of the last 26 years and kept customer lights on over 99.9% of the time in 2023, 2024 and is on track to do the same in 2025.

30%: California's 2035 EV Mandate Loses Steam

Photo by: Rivian

The California Air Resources Board (CARB), now blocked by the federal government from enforcing its far-reaching emissions rules, has begun rethinking some of them. Its target goal to eliminate the sales of new gas cars by 2035 has been a long-standing push by the state government, but now it's becoming a ""very active area of discussion.""

The federal waiver given to California under the Clean Air Act allowed the state to set its own emission standards. More than a dozen other states then agreed to follow these standards. Axios gives a briefing on what's up in the air now—besides pollution:

California's strict emission rules, blocked by the Trump administration in June, had been a template for other states that share its ambitious climate goals.

But as they now look to replace those rules, state regulators are signaling that requiring all new cars to be electric by 2035 might not be practical anymore. Affordability concerns, vanishing tax incentives and insufficient EV charging infrastructure make it unlikely that automakers can achieve escalating EV sales targets.

""We cannot enforce these rules at the moment,"" Christopher Grundler, deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, told participants at a CARB workshop last month.

Coming along for the legal ride are other states where Attorneys General have signed onto the lawsuit against the Feds to fight for California's state rights. Other states like Maryland, Washington and Vermont have paused enforcement of their own EV sales targets.

Here's what CARB's chair told Politico:

CARB officially opened its rulemaking on new vehicle emissions regulations at a workshop last week, and hopes to finalize the rules by summer 2027.

“I think that remains a very ambitious goal, and I am grateful — as you saw in the workshop last week — that we now have the time to rethink creatively what that goal should be going forward,” Sanchez said in a wide-ranging interview with POLITICO.

As it looks, though, plenty of people in California and across the U.S. will continue to drive (and buy) new gas cars in a decade. But that's a long time from now and—as we've seen—a lot can change in 10 years.

60%: Lyft CEO Says Robotaxis Won't Replace Humans Anytime Soon

Photo by: Lyft

Robotaxi proponents love to talk up the potential of a driverless future like the current market is just some giant loading screen between the invention of the steering wheel and its removal. Naturally, AV providers are some of the most excited about this potential—but not all rideshare companies are feeling that way.

Lyft's CEO, David Risher, recently spoke on the topic with a more grounded take: human drivers aren't going anywhere any time soon. Not in ten years, and certainly not in five. Manufacturers aren't ready, and neither are regulators or riders. Here's what Fortune, quoting Risher, has to say:

“That will be the case for years and years and years to come,” he said. The [car manufacturers] aren’t entirely ready. The technology isn’t entirely ready for fog or snow or heavy rain or whatever it is. People, riders aren’t necessarily excited about it [and] regulators aren’t necessarily enthusiastic about it in every place,” he said.

That’s going to make the rollout of self-driving slow. Risher said he would be surprised if 10% of Lyft’s business came from self-driving vehicles by 2030.

He thinks most people are wary of self-driving cars and prefer a human at the wheel. “Customers won’t demand it. They’ll just say, I don’t want to get in a self-driving car.”

There's an ulterior motive to Risher's belief, though: the almighty dollar.

It comes from the value proposition that robotaxis bring the company. Sure, they can't call in sick, but with the way that Lyft operates today, many of the company's actual costs—we're talking about depreciation, maintenance, cleaning, charging and even some financial risk—are shifted to the driver since they're the owner of the vehicle. That sort of risk transfer is the company's entire business model as of today.

There's also a massive upfront cost to buy a full-fledged, vetted autonomous vehicle capable of being a robotaxi. “Today, these cost maybe $250,000 to $300,000,"" said Risher, clearly disregarding Tesla's promise of a cheap, vision-based autonomous robotaxi. ""A very expensive product, whereas a Prius or Corolla is maybe $30,00 or $40,000.”

So, where does the CEO see things going? Nowhere fast: “I don’t think the idea of a driver being replaced by a robot is a very likely thing. In fact, I think it’s zero likelihood in any reasonable time frame.""

90%: Detroit Summoned To Testify In DC Together For First Time Since 2008

Photo by: InsideEVs

It looks like Detroit is getting the band back together. Not for a reunion tour, but for a formal hearing. For the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, Detroit's big three—Ford, GM and Stellantis—are being summoned to Washington together.

The trio (plus Tesla, to represent Silicon Valley) will make their way to Capitol Hill in January so that lawmakers can poke and prod one big elephant that helped drive inflation over the last five years: vehicle affordability. But their target here is clearly emissions rules and investments in electric vehicles.

Automotive News reveals the details:

The committee’s Jan. 14 hearing “will examine how radical global warming regulations and mandated technologies have driven up the cost of vehicles for American consumers,” [Senator Ted] Cruz said in a statement.

The Texas Republican said American consumers are “hyper-focused” on rising vehicle prices and that Congress needs to address the issue. In the statement, he said senators want to look at “how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice.”

[...] The invitation to testify cited data saying the average price of a new vehicle in the U.S. has doubled from $24,296 in 2015 to more than $50,000 today.

When the three were last in D.C. together, the atmosphere was less conversational and more about Washington helping out with a bailout. Nobody is asking for checks this time around, though. Instead, it seems like a politically-charged probe into safety and regulatory requirements set during previous administrations.

Interestingly—and surely without coincidence—these hearings will be held on the first day of the 2026 Detroit Auto Show. That means that if any new products or big announcements are to be made that day, it'll be done without the help of the CEOs.

100%: Can Automakers Talk Their Way Out Of The Affordability Crisis?

When adjusted for inflation, the average vehicle price of $24,296 from 2015 is about $34,000. Lawmakers want to know where that other $16,000 came from, and some appear to suspect the additional costs are related to ""mandated technologies"" and emissions.

Since 2015, automakers have been required to add tech like rear backup cameras, have voluntarily added automatic emergency braking in preparation for further mandates and also new ADAS tech (like lane centering) that require more advanced sensor suites. And let's not forget stricter emission requirements.

Are lawmakers right in probing automakers about inflated costs, or is the reasoning obvious? And what does that mean for the future of vehicle prices are tech becomes even more intricate?

“(Those floods) woke up a lot of people to the fact that climate change is happening now, in real time,” McEwan said.
“What we’re seeing at the federal level is a morally indefensible and astronomically ignorant approach to energy and climate action,” DFL State Rep. Larry Kraft said on the call.
Given the vast scale of human-caused climate change, however, their direct planetary impact will be negligible.
And formidable funding challenges — made worse by the federal government’s war on clean energy and climate science — loom over the entire enterprise.","Minnesotans stared at their screens in horror last June as the raging Blue Earth River swallowed a beloved country store near Mankato. The same flood badly damaged a nearby dam and caused well over $1 billion dollars in damage across 22 southern Minnesota counties.

It was one of more than 60 billion-dollar weather disasters to hit the state over the past 45 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About 20 of those have struck since 2021, laying bare the real-world stakes of a warmer, wetter Upper Midwest.

As the Trump administration sits out an annual United Nations climate change meeting in Brazil that could (maybe) produce a detailed roadmap to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels, local governments in Minnesota and across the U.S. are preparing for more extreme weather to come.

At least 22 Minnesota city, county, regional and tribal governments have published “climate action” or resilience plans to mitigate the human and financial costs of future weather disasters, according to a report out Tuesday from Josefina Hajek-Herrera, a fellow with the Building Power Resource Center and climate policy consultant.

They include Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester, Duluth and 12 other communities with more than 10,000 Minnesotans. Mankato published its own climate action plan less than a year after the June 2024 flood inundated low-lying parts of town.

State Sen. Jen McEwan, DFL-Duluth, said during a call — hosted by report sponsors 100%, an environmental justice nonprofit, and Building Power Resource Center — that the infrastructure-busting impacts of extreme weather are apparent even in her purported “climate change haven” hometown.

In June 2012, Duluth received over seven inches of rain in less than 48 hours, tearing up hillside roads and sewers. Powerful storms damaged Duluth’s popular Lakewalk a few years later, spurring a major fortification project set to begin construction in 2026.

“(Those floods) woke up a lot of people to the fact that climate change is happening now, in real time,” McEwan said.

The planning push comes as President Trump rolls back ambitious environmental laws, regulations and programs enacted under former President Biden. The Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress have canceled billions in federal grants to help local governments reduce pollution and harden infrastructure against extreme weather. Billions more remain in legal limbo, including $7 billion in renewable energy funding for lower-income communities — which the Biden administration said would cut energy bills for 900,000 households — and nearly $1 billion for “pre-disaster” mitigation projects.

“What we’re seeing at the federal level is a morally indefensible and astronomically ignorant approach to energy and climate action,” DFL State Rep. Larry Kraft said on the call. Minnesota cities, he added, “can pick up the slack.”

Municipal planning staff or outside consultants take the lead on climate action planning, often with substantial input from residents, businesses and community groups. Most plans detail a mix of shorter- and longer-term goals to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, such as by purchasing renewable power, installing high-efficiency electric heating at city facilities and adding electric vehicles to city fleets.

Those goals mirror or in some cases front-run Minnesota’s statutory mandate for statewide carbon neutrality by 2050. In that sense, the plans put a local spin on what state law already requires over the next 25 years. Given the vast scale of human-caused climate change, however, their direct planetary impact will be negligible.

In recognition that the costs of climate change are already piling up, all but one of the 10 climate action plans released since 2022 contain “climate vulnerability assessments” that identify populations and infrastructure most at risk from extreme heat, flooding, poor air quality, food insecurity and high energy costs, Hajek-Herrera said in the report.

The report hails successes like St. Paul’s jargon-free Climate Action Dashboard, which shows progress toward its 2030 goal of carbon-neutrality in city operations across city-led initiatives like electric heating at Como Park Zoo and Conservatory and the new, ultra-low-impact North End Community Center.

On the call, Diana Chaman Salas, Hennepin County climate and resiliency department director, ticked off some of her employer’s accomplishments: a 10% cut to miles driven by county vehicles, a comparable reduction in county departments’ electricity use from onsite solar power by 2027 and enough community garden capacity to feed 1,000 people last year.

But recent plans’ focus on “cross-jurisdictional relationships” relating to transportation, education, renewable energy development and other projects offer tacit acknowledgement that local governments can’t do everything on their own.

St. Paul admits its fleet electrification plan has been held back by slow deployment of public charging infrastructure. Grand Marais fell behind on its building electrification goals earlier this decade due in part to a local shortage of qualified heat pump technicians, Hajek-Herrera said in the report. Electric grid constraints and red tape around key grant programs have stymied Northfield’s ambitious plans for solar arrays on public property.

And formidable funding challenges — made worse by the federal government’s war on clean energy and climate science — loom over the entire enterprise.

“Ongoing uncertainty in federal climate policy further underscores the necessity for sustained and enhanced state-level support to bridge implementation gaps and strengthen local capacity,” Hajek-Herrera said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/electricschoolbus-1536x1024-1-1024x6831763648646.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ZtIrNV6d,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:24.223218

The conversations have been edited for clarity and length. Here’s why we’re doing this.

I’m a professor of environmental health at Drexel University. I study how the impacts of pollution can differ because of a person’s surroundings and individual circumstances. This will be an important influence on children’s health as the climate changes, an area that I have focused on in recent years.

I had a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to identify the relationships between heat, pollution and children’s health in New York State. It’s an important case study because New York State includes the most and least populated areas in the country, like Manhattan and the Adirondacks.

Instead of looking at things that can cause stress, like income inequality, and how those can make the effects of heat and pollution worse, we were trying to identify the resources in communities where children appear to be less affected by heat and pollution. This information can help identify the most cost-effective changes communities can make to protect their children.

We combined data on 22 million child emergency department visits and hospitalizations with U.S. census information. We also considered a wide range of community factors not included in those data sets — everything from supermarket locations, transportation access, voter registration and broadband access. A Ph.D. student in my lab reached out to 350 school districts in the state. So a lot of groundwork was done to build up a really complicated and huge database that represented a massive number of children statewide.

It was a three-year grant, but it built on research that we had been developing for over 15 years. Our early results showed that days with high air pollution and extreme temperatures did have more child emergency department visits.

On May 12, I received an email saying our project was to be terminated immediately. There was no warning, no conversation.

At the time, we were in the final stages of being able to combine our data to answer the critical question: Which community investments really matter, and how can they help children be more resilient to pollution and heat? The next step would have been to finish analyzing the data, but we weren’t able to get that far.

We appealed the cancellation and got a response stating that the project wasn’t within the scope of the current E.P.A. The administration has decided to close the entire division supporting this grant, the Office of Research and Development. It was funding my lab’s work, and the work of so many other people doing really important stuff in environmental health science.

An abrupt cancellation means that we will never get the payoff from so much upfront investment. We wanted another year to support our doctoral students and finish the work, and spend time reporting back to our community and government partners to make sure that they were getting all the information they were promised out of this process.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/19/multimedia/00cli-lostsci-cloughtery-lcmj/00cli-lostsci-cloughtery-lcmj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 11:04:58.138680

Power wants flexibility from power-hungry data centres | CBC News,"Jacques Poitras, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-flexibility-data-centres-9.6984931,"“It wasn't anything to do with our planning around the gas plant,” Brad Coady, N.B.
The data centre would store data for artificial intelligence services, websites, apps and other operations.
There’s no plan to do the same with data centres, Liberal Energy Minister René Legacy said recently.
“The crypto world that that we faced back when the prohibition was put in place is much different than the data centres,” Coady said.
Power’s debt, data centres can “spread our costs over more kilowatt hours so it actually lowers the rates or takes pressure off rates for all.","N.B. Power says it’s not alarmed by the electricity needs of a proposed data centre in the Lorneville area of Saint John but will be looking for flexibility from such plants on their consumption.

A senior executive at the Crown utility also says there is no link between the proposed 400-megawatt natural gas plant it wants to see built in Tantramar and the data centre’s need for 190 megawatts.

“It wasn't anything to do with our planning around the gas plant,” Brad Coady, N.B. Power's chief commercial officer, said in an interview.

“In fact, if you rewind back the record, we were thinking about the gas plant long before I ever heard of any of these data centres that have been in media lately.”

Tantramar Green Party MLA Megan Mitton has alleged a link between the controversial plan for the gas plant, to be built by U.S.-based ProEnergy, and the data centre, a partnership between two U.S. companies, VoltaGrid and Beacon AI.

“It makes you wonder if this additional demand is why N.B. Power has invited a different American Trump donor’s company to burn fracked gas in Tantramar by 2028,” Mitton said in the legislature earlier this month.

The data centre would store data for artificial intelligence services, websites, apps and other operations.

Proponents say it would use 190 megawatts from its own on-site natural gas generation and 190 megawatts to come from N.B. Power — the latter the equivalent of about half what the utility would get from the gas plant.

N.B. Power said when it announced the gas plant that it was needed to head off a potential electricity shortfall three years from now due to population and economic growth.

Utility officials told a legislative committee in 2023 that the previous winter they faced an all-time peak demand for electricity that they came perilously close to not being able to meet.

Coady told CBC News that N.B. Power’s “modest growth” forecast for demand, its likeliest scenario, anticipates “fairly stable, fairly flat, low growth” of less than one per cent a year.

He said the utility will want agreements with data centres that would have them shut down, or rely exclusively on their own on-site power generation or battery storage, during peak demand periods.

“We're really leaning in to say, ‘Can we do flexible arrangements with these types of customers in a way that makes sense for New Brunswick?’” he said.

“If the answer is yes, then we have a pathway ahead. If the answer is no, maybe it's a check and adjustment, and further conversations need to be had.”

Volta Grid CEO Nathan Ough told CBC News the Lorneville data centre’s on-site gas generation could even feed electricity back to the grid when there’s a peak in demand.

“Don’t view data centres as this kind of demand hog,” Ough told CBC News.

“Now data centres are no longer a pure demand source. They’re a demand-slash-supply source.”

Coady said that scenario is plausible, “but would require careful co-ordination to orchestrate.”

Green Party Leader David Coon says N.B. Power’s forecast of low load growth is at odds with its rationale for the gas plant.

“What they’re saying is contradictory because they keep telling us we desperately need this gas plant in Tantramar because the lights are going to go out on the next cold day by 2028. So it doesn’t line up.”

He is calling for a new process that would require data centre proposals to get approval from the provincial government and N.B. Power based on their electricity consumption, separate from the New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board's setting of power rates for a large industrial plant.

A new report released Tuesday by the North American Electrical Reliability Corporation, a continental regulator that assesses if utilities can meet demand, said that the Maritimes are the only region in Canada where there’s a risk of a shortfall.

The region’s “reserve margin” of electricity is below what the Electrical Reliability Corporation considers a level necessary to meet peak demand in extreme conditions, such as winter storms.

The report expects peak demand to be slightly lower this winter than last winter, but says it’s still enough to pose a risk given the low reserve margin.

The report also identifies data centres as driving a growing demand for electricity in North America, though it doesn’t have specific numbers for New Brunswick or the Maritimes.

Under the provincial Electricity Act, N.B. Power is obligated to provide power to any industrial facility setting up in the province.

The Progressive Conservative government of Blaine Higgs passed legislation two years ago to exempt crypto mines from that requirement because of the huge amount of electricity they consume.

There’s no plan to do the same with data centres, Liberal Energy Minister René Legacy said recently.

Coady said N.B. Power was alarmed by the sudden rush to set up crypto mines in the province in 2022 and 2023 because such plants can be transient — setting up quickly and requiring costly new N.B. Power generation, only to potentially leave again after a short time.

“The crypto world that that we faced back when the prohibition was put in place is much different than the data centres,” Coady said.

“They may seem related, but they're completely different in terms of investment and stability.”

He said with the need to raise power rates to address N.B. Power’s debt, data centres can “spread our costs over more kilowatt hours so it actually lowers the rates or takes pressure off rates for all. That's the golden opportunity.”

Ough said the utility would refuse to service the data centre if it were going to create problems for the overall supply of electricity.

“That’s just how the world works,” he said.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/1.6748377,1676410792000/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1919%2C1079%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-20 14:02:36.542171

Taking the closure language out of federal hands still leaves Comanche 2 and other closures in state regulations, and Colorado will enforce those no matter what the Trump administration does, state officials say.
“A decision is expected in mid-December.” Air Pollution Control Director Michael Ogletree said in an emailed statement, “The big picture is that Colorado’s commitments and priorities have not changed.
On Wednesday, the administration again ordered an extension of operations at a Michigan plant originally scheduled to close last May, and state officials and environmental groups are fighting the extensions in court.
Tri-State operates Craig Station and co-owns it with the Salt River Project, the Platte River Power Authority, PacifiCorp and Xcel Energy.","Colorado health officials want to withdraw the looming closure of Xcel’s Comanche 2 coal power unit in Pueblo from federal review in order to extend its operations through expected high demand next summer, but environmental groups charge the Polis administration with further backsliding on dirty coal.

A last-minute agenda item asks the Air Quality Control Commission on Thursday to approve a state letter pulling Comanche 2’s closure on Dec. 31 from a federally required plan to fight haze and other air pollution. State clean air and renewable energy officials are working with Xcel and the Public Utilities Commission to reverse Comanche 2’s pending closure and allow it to operate through 2026 to avoid electric shortages and fuel price hikes.

State officials call the letter to the EPA a strategic retreat, and insist they are not giving up legislatively mandated targets to close coal plants and have 80% of Colorado’s electricity generated by clean, renewable sources by 2030. Taking the closure language out of federal hands still leaves Comanche 2 and other closures in state regulations, and Colorado will enforce those no matter what the Trump administration does, state officials say.

“Withdrawing the provision ensures the federal process aligns with the state process” while the PUC evaluates the Comanche 2 extension petition from Xcel and state agencies, a state spokesperson said. “A decision is expected in mid-December.”

Air Pollution Control Director Michael Ogletree said in an emailed statement, “The big picture is that Colorado’s commitments and priorities have not changed. We are continuing to protect air quality and reduce emissions from power generation while ensuring Coloradans’ access to affordable, reliable energy. This strategic move will help the state ensure a just, equitable transition from coal plants while we continue addressing climate change, regional haze, and ground-level ozone pollution.”

But it’s a surrender, not a strategic retreat, environmental advocates say.

“If the dates are only in state rules it means only the state can enforce the dates. Given that state health and the Colorado Energy Office have already indicated they intend to appease the Trump administration and support keeping several coal-fired power plants open beyond their retirement dates, it’s clear they likely have no intention of enforcing the retirement dates,” said Jeremy Nichols, with the Center for Biological Diversity.

“This whole thing could just be a cover up to make the retirement dates meaningless through a lack of enforcement,” Nichols said. “It’s really bizarre, I don’t see any strategy here, just a disturbing willingness by the Polis administration to completely back down from our state’s commitments on climate and clean energy.”

Colorado’s coal-plant closure plans are being stretched by a combination of Xcel’s operational failures and rapid growth in high-volume electricity demand from data centers that Xcel says will push needs up 8% a year. Xcel’s troubled Comanche 3 unit at the Pueblo complex is offline again until at least June, after years of breakdowns. Xcel on Nov. 10 applied to the PUC — supported by state clean air officials and the Colorado Energy Office — to extend smaller Comanche 2’s operations for 2026 to provide backup and reliability at peak periods where sharply increased demand has eliminated any cushion.

Comanche’s unit 1 was retired in 2022.

Sierra Club Colorado declined comment on the pending AQCC vote regarding the EPA, saying the group was working on its filing for the same questions confronting the PUC. But the club has previously said the consequences of Comanche 2 running throughout 2026 are clear: “more air pollution in Pueblo and higher electricity bills for everyone.”

The Trump administration has been overriding local plans in multiple states as it tries to boost the coal industry, ordering some coal plants to stay open beyond their scheduled shuttering date. On Wednesday, the administration again ordered an extension of operations at a Michigan plant originally scheduled to close last May, and state officials and environmental groups are fighting the extensions in court.

The Tri-State Generation cooperative is also expecting Trump administration orders to keep the 45-year-old, 446-megawatt Craig Unit 1 running in Moffat County.

The unit is scheduled to close at the end of the year, and the Craig Station’s two other units will close in 2028. Tri-State operates Craig Station and co-owns it with the Salt River Project, the Platte River Power Authority, PacifiCorp and Xcel Energy.

Xcel’s Comanche operations have been the center of a policy tug of war for years. Many civic leaders in Pueblo County are worried about the loss of jobs and Xcel tax revenues when the coal units shut down, and some are even floating the idea of building a modern nuclear reactor on the site to create jobs. Other advocacy and neighborhood groups have fought pollution from Comanche and Pueblo’s other industrial sources for decades, and have looked forward to decommissioning the coal units.

The letter to the EPA that state health officials are asking the air quality commission to approve credits state agencies for their “robust and nimble” response to operational problems at Comanche 3 and the growing data center demand for energy. The letter adds, though, that the Air Pollution Control Division also intends to work with Xcel “to minimize and mitigate any emissions impact from this action.”

Colorado’s environmental groups aren’t buying it, and will make their opposition known in public comment periods before the AQCC’s vote to advance the letter Thursday.

“The Polis administration is clearly going to bat for coal, opting to keep dirty and costly coal burning power plants operating rather than holding utilities accountable to building out the affordable clean energy we need,” Nichols said. “Xcel’s ‘reliability’ issues are its own fault, and the company shouldn’t be rewarded with a free pass to keep polluting.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Colo_Sun_Comanche_01_Sept_2025-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:01:24.892096

Sen. Todd Young, Indiana Republican, has been one of the loudest voices urging U.S. leadership to get aggressive on rare-earth metals.","Rare-earth magnet company Vulcan Elements revealed plans Tuesday to build a $1 billion factory in Benson, North Carolina, as U.S. companies look to compete with China over rare-earth dominance.

The facility will have a magnet manufacturing capacity of 10,000 metric tons and is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs. Construction of the facility is expected to begin within the next year, and employees are anticipated to be on site by 2029, according to Vulcan Elements’ statement.

The upcoming facility follows news of a heavy U.S. government investment in Vulcan Elements. Earlier this month, the company announced a $1.4 billion partnership with the government to expand the “vertically integrated, domestic magnet supply chain” for rare-earth magnets.

That investment is part of a broader U.S. strategy to increase competition in the mining and refining of rare-earth metals, which China currently dominates. Rare-earth metals are essential components of most electronics, from consumer goods like smartphones to security systems such as autonomous drones and ballistic missiles.

Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin noted the importance of the rare-earth supply chain, adding that the North Carolina facility is a crucial step in building U.S. dominance.

“We need to draw on world-class talent, innovation and infrastructure as we secure one of the 21st century’s most important supply chains. As home to our current facility, North Carolina has proven that it has all three,” Mr. Maslin wrote in a statement. “And as we create 1,000 new American jobs, we will tap into the region’s deep bench of experience across industries — from engineers and technicians who understand hardware and manufacturing to military veterans who have spent their careers managing complex supply chains, operating heavy machinery, and serving their country.”

Ironically, the metals themselves are not rare and are found during most mining operations. However, the refinement process is technical and expensive.

Beijing currently has a stranglehold over the industry, controlling over 50% of the mining sector and approximately 90% of the world’s rare-earth refinement infrastructure. Experts say China’s level of control is alarming and could have disastrous effects for U.S. security.

“The tank, the battleship, nuclear energy, wind energy, gas energy, all of it relies on rare earth metals. And without it, our society is crippled not from a military standpoint, only from an actual everyday operation standpoint,” said Nick Myers, CEO and co-founder of rare-earth processing company Phoenix Tailings. “They are playing on a different level right now. China is engaging in economic warfare. They understand that warfare is not all kinetic, and they’re leveraging their economic power.”

Mr. Myers said Phoenix Tailings is one of the few U.S. companies seeking to support an entirely domestic rare-earth supply chain to bolster self-sufficiency. The company takes the waste, or tailings, of mining operations and processes it to produce rare-earth metals.

U.S. lawmakers have begun to sound the alarm over China’s dominance in the processing of rare-earth metals. Sen. Todd Young, Indiana Republican, has been one of the loudest voices urging U.S. leadership to get aggressive on rare-earth metals.

“They have vast stores of rare-earth minerals and other critical minerals that they provide into the American market,” the senator said of China in an exclusive interview with Threat Status. “These are key inputs as we electrify our economy. And they’re also key inputs to other, important, manufactured goods like defense articles. We literally cannot produce our defense goods without access to rare-earth minerals.”

In April, Mr. Young introduced a bill with Sen. Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat, that urges the U.S. Geological Survey to give America a more competitive edge in developing mines around the world. The bill, which has been cosigned by Sens. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, and John Hickenlooper, Colorado Democrat, is awaiting action in the Senate.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/11/04/China_Rare_Earths_59932_c0-146-2400-1546_s1200x700.jpg?132f371bebba18b50c5d95c76a93ddcb6d43cdf6,N,,2025-11-20 10:01:55.670839

Power generation firms disclose their overall power output and the categorization of various power generation methods in their annual reports.
Renewable energy power generation can effectively diminish carbon emissions by substituting traditional thermal power generation and is projected to garner substantial support from local governments, including policy subsidies and loans.
Renewable energy power generation corresponds with the concept of green development and has emerged as the future trajectory of the power industry.
The study exclusively focuses on REPPSPs, disregarding other renewable energy power generation policies, which may impose certain constraints.","China is optimizing its energy structure and reducing carbon emissions by transitioning from a coal-dominated power generation model to one reliant on renewable energy sources. Although renewable energy produces significantly fewer carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, its advancement is marked by elevated costs and substantial technological obstacles, resulting in higher expenditures for renewable energy generation (Li et al., 2022). China has enacted several regulatory initiatives to foster the sustainable development of REPGFs. The renewable energy power price subsidy policies (REPPSPs) are designed to enhance the market competitiveness and profitability of REPGFs through financial support (Özdemir et al., 2020). While REPPSPs mitigate the generating costs of REPGFs, the rapid escalation of China’s renewable energy output has intensified the issue of insufficient funding for these initiatives. This emerging tension—between the policy’s intent to foster REPGF sustainability and the escalating fiscal pressure threatening its continuity—poses a pivotal question: How, and to what extent, do REPPSPs enhance the resilience and long-term sustainability of REPGFs in China? Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of REPPSPs on the sustainability performance of China’s REPGFs, with a specific emphasis on essential aspects of firm resilience.

The renewable energy power generation industry in China faces substantial challenges, such as the absence of well-established market trading mechanisms, low resource utilization efficiency, incomplete market-oriented pricing mechanisms, and insufficient implementation of the guaranteed purchase system for renewable energy power generation. In 2016, the National Development and Reform Commission released the MMFGAREPG to promote the reform of China’s power system, implement a market-oriented pricing mechanism for renewable energy power, and reinforce the management of the guaranteed purchase of renewable energy power generation.

The MMFGAREPG stipulates that grid firms must fully purchase the on-grid electricity generated by renewable energy projects within the specified planning boundaries, based on the national benchmark electricity price and guaranteed acquisition hours, while integrating market competition mechanisms. The annual electricity production from grid-connected renewable energy projects is divided into two components: guaranteed acquisition electricity and market trading electricity. The guaranteed acquisition portion of electricity is fully purchased at the benchmark on-grid electricity price through prioritized annual generation planning and priority power purchase agreements with the grid. The market trading portion of electricity is safeguarded by REPGFs via market competition for generation contracts, which the grid implements on a priority dispatch basis.

The aforementioned policies seek to address the challenge of renewable energy power consumption and may enable REPGFs to generate stable revenue through electricity production. Furthermore, the pricing mechanism for renewable energy electricity has transitioned from full government pricing to a hybrid model, where part is set by government pricing and the rest is determined through market-oriented trading mechanisms. This approach underscores the critical role of market mechanisms in resource allocation, which may incentivize REPGFs to enhance operational efficiency and obtain more benefits via heightened electricity generation. Consequently, the MMFGAREPG may influence the sustainable development capabilities of REPGFs. The critical significance of REPGF resilience in enabling the low-carbon transition warrants focused consideration.

The Chinese energy market and regulatory framework possess distinctive characteristics. For instance, the National Development and Reform Commission spearheads the development of energy policies, which are executed efficiently but may result in a “one-size-fits-all” approach. The coexistence of benchmark coal-fired electricity prices and market-driven prices for renewable energy leads to distorted price signals. Local fiscal pressure causes delays in subsidy allocation, especially as the recent economic decline in China has imposed considerable strain on local finances, directly impacting the liquidity of REPGFs. China’s REPPSPs are the largest globally and have a complex mechanism; nonetheless, their effectiveness is constrained by the unique policy-market interaction. The research findings hold important reference value for emerging economies. Therefore, this study aims to enhance the effectiveness of the MMFGAREPG in fostering the development and growth of the renewable energy power generation industry by examining its direct impact on the resilience and long-term sustainability of REPGFs, especially within a swiftly evolving energy market.

Power generation firms disclose their overall power output and the categorization of various power generation methods in their annual reports. This study involves a manual review of annual reports from power generation firms, classifying those whose renewable energy production (from wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean, and hydropower sources) exceeds 80% of their total generation, as defined by the MMFGAREPG, as REPGFs. Based on this classification, REPGFs are identified as the treatment group, whereas other power generation firms are categorized as the control group. This paper analyzes the effect of the MMFGAREPG implementation on the resilience of REPGFs, utilizing a sample of Chinese listed power generation firms and considering the 2016 introduction of the MMFGAREPG as a policy shock event. The results indicate that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the resilience of REPGFs.

We further investigate how the implementation of the MMFGAREPG influences the resilience of REPGFs through financing, efficiency, and fundamental channels, represented by financial slack, innovation efficiency, and green investors, respectively. The MMFGAREPG increases the financial slack of REPGFs, attracts more green investors to these firms, and further enhances their resilience. Furthermore, we find that the MMFGAREPG improves the innovation efficiency of REPGFs, indicating the beneficial impact of market competitive mechanisms on the innovation efficiency of REPGFs. The details can be visualized in the graphical abstract of Fig. 1.

We contribute to the literature on REPPSPs. Prior studies have predominantly focused on the influence of REPPSPs on carbon emissions (Kök et al., 2018), power generation costs (Zhao et al., 2014), renewable energy development (Nicolini and Tavoni, 2017), and green technology innovation (Lee et al., 2022). The literature above primarily relies on theoretical models to validate the effects of REPPSPs, lacking empirical evidence derived from real-world data. This work is, to the knowledge, the inaugural empirical investigation of the role of REPPSPs in enhancing the organizational resilience of REPGFs utilizing actual data. Specifically, we explore how multi-mechanism policies, like the MMFGAREPG, enhance the resilience of REPGFs through pathways such as financial slack, innovation efficiency, and fundamentals. The findings offer robust empirical evidence that REPPSPs positively contribute to the sustainable development of REPGFs. This paper integrates energy policy analysis with organizational resilience theory, addressing the limitations of traditional macroeconomic or technology-focused research. We elucidate the micro-level mechanisms underlying the impact of REPPSPs on the resilience of REPGFs within a mixed market context characterized by government leadership and limited competition. We provide a solid foundation for China to optimize the tapering rhythm of subsidies and design regionally differentiated policies.

This study is also closely related to REPGFs. Limited research has been conducted on REPGFs, with current studies predominantly addressing excess profits (Jaraitė and Kažukauskas, 2013), incentive policies (Zhao et al., 2016), resource allocation (Weigelt and Shittu, 2016), and portfolio strategies (Zhang et al., 2022). However, these studies do not establish definitive criteria for classifying REPGFs. This study involves a manual analysis of annual data from power generation firms, identifying those classified as REPGFs if their renewable energy generation—encompassing wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean, and hydropower, as defined by the MMFGAREPG—constitutes above 80% of their overall power output. This approach effectively mitigates sample bias in REPGF classification arising from self-declaration and inaccurate database categorization. Furthermore, the resilience of REPGFs has not been sufficiently addressed in previous literature. The resilience of firms denotes their ability to endure external risk shocks (Dormady et al., 2019; Iftikhar et al., 2021), and robust resilience signifies enhanced potential for sustainable development. We examine the sustainable development of REPGFs via the perspective of organizational resilience and confirm the beneficial impact of market competition mechanisms on the resilience of REPGFs. This study contributes to the literature on REPGFs by providing theoretical support for promoting their sustainable development through market competition mechanisms.

In physics, resilience denotes a material’s capacity to absorb energy during plastic deformation and fracture. Higher resilience correlates with less susceptibility to brittle fracture. In the context of firms, resilience represents the ability to withstand risk shocks. Resilience refers to a firm’s ability to maintain its core functions and achieve sustainable development by absorbing shocks, adapting to changes, and proactively transforming. Firms with higher resilience can better mitigate external risks and minimize their adverse effects (Croci et al., 2024). For REPGFs, resilience is distinctly exhibited in the following dimensions. In terms of absorptive capacity: short-term resistance to shocks such as electricity price fluctuations, policy changes (including subsidy reduction), or natural disasters (such as extreme weather causing power generation). Regarding adaptive capacity: mid-term modifications of business models (for instance, transitioning from centralized to distributed power generation) or technological routes (such as enhancing energy storage efficiency). In terms of transformative capacity: the long-term reconstruction of the value chain to cope with fundamental changes in the energy system.

The renewable energy industry is characterized by high capital intensity, long payback durations, and sensitivity to policy changes. The importance of financial buffers greatly surpasses that of industries with stable cash flows, such as manufacturing. The government’s assurance to acquire green power at a fixed feed-in tariff beyond the market price secures the fundamental revenue for REPGFs. The fixed feed-in tariff purchase income assists REPGFs in mitigating risks, including delayed renewable energy subsidy payments and electricity price fluctuations, while maintaining their normal operations. The MMFGAREPG secures the revenue from power generation for REPGFs, reducing the risk of cash flow disruption caused by wind and solar curtailment or electricity price fluctuations. Stable cash flow might facilitate the replacement of short-term high-interest loans with long-term debt (such as converting short-term financing into green bonds), hence diminishing leverage and interest burdens. REPGFs need not excessively reserve liquidity funds to address market concerns, allowing them to focus capital on effective capacity expansion or technical research and development, thus systematically improving their risk resilience. The MMFGAREPG effectively ensures the consumption of renewable energy power, reduces the additional costs faced by REPGFs in electricity sales, and thus improves their financial flexibility.

In the face of external uncertainty and risks, financial slack serves as a crucial financial cushion for firms, which in turn reduces their reliance on external financing, decreases financing costs, and enhances their financial stability (John et al., 2017). Firms with substantial financial slack can more flexibly adjust their business strategies in response to market fluctuations, thereby adapting promptly and sustaining a competitive advantage under complex, dynamic market environments (Lungeanu et al., 2016). Higher financial slack functions as precautionary savings, buffering firms against future risks and uncertainties. This process enables more effective responses to risk shocks and alleviates adverse impacts (Vanacker et al., 2017), thus alleviating resilience. The analysis presented above leads to the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: The implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the resilience of REPGFs.

Hypothesis 2: The implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the resilience of REPGFs by increasing their financial slack.

The MMFGAREPG categorizes power generation from renewable energy projects into two segments: the guaranteed acquisition electricity portion and the market transaction electricity portion. REPGFs can augment their sales revenue by selling surplus electricity through competitive markets, beyond the guaranteed purchase quota. According to the economic man hypothesis, which posits that economic agents seek to maximize profits (Stoelhorst, 2023), REPGFs may leverage profits from guaranteed electricity purchases to invest in technological innovation, thereby enhancing power generation capacity. This augmented capacity allows REPGFs to concurrently earn elevated revenue and profits through guaranteed purchases and market trading avenues.

The MMFGAREPG mitigates uncertainty in renewable energy power consumption, alleviates income instability for REPGFs due to wind and solar power curtailment or electricity price fluctuations, reduces excess funds retained by REPGFs for risk management, and releases additional cash flow for technological research and development. Stable income expectations enhance the credit ratings of REPGFs, thereby drawing financial backing, including green bonds and venture capital, for high-cost innovation projects. A stable cash flow improves the balance sheets of REPGFs, facilitating their attainment of international certifications and their inclusion in the green power procurement lists of multinational firms. Efficient renewable energy technologies decrease equipment failure rates and enhance the stability of renewable energy grid integration, reducing production suspension losses due to natural disasters and lessening the risk of power curtailment owing to grid fluctuations. The reduction in losses and enhanced capacity to withstand risk shocks resulting from these technological innovations can motivate REPGFs to continuously invest in technological research and development, thus fostering a virtuous cycle.

REPGFs exhibiting strong innovation efficiency can timely launch products and services with differentiated competitive advantages in response to market demands so as to maintain their market position and competitiveness. This capability helps them better cope with various uncertainties, such as policy adjustments and economic fluctuations (Cooper et al., 2022). REPGFs with high innovation efficiency can optimally leverage diverse resources and allocate them to high-potential projects, resulting in higher resource utilization efficiency. The optimization of resource allocation improves operational efficiency for organizations and offers supplementary resource buffers to alleviate external risk shocks, thus diminishing their adverse effects and augmenting resilience (Kong et al., 2023). The preceding analysis gives rise to the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 3: The implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the resilience of REPGFs by improving their innovation efficiency.

The MMFGAREPG can increase the future income of REPGFs, diminish profit volatility, and elevate the price-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio, therefore aiding in the attraction of green investors. Investors who prioritize low-carbon initiatives, environmental protection, and sustainable development are termed green investors. Green investors emphasize the green attributes of their investment targets over returns, making them less sensitive to the returns of green assets (Wang, 2024). Green investors emphasize the environmental qualities of their investment aims rather than financial returns, rendering them less responsive to the profitability of green assets (Wang, 2024). Green investors are less inclined to liquidate green assets, preferring to retain them long-term due to their perceived financial value. The low sensitivity of green investors to asset returns allows them to hold assets for a longer period rather than engaging in frequent short-term trading. Green investors increase their holdings in REPGFs, optimizing the equity structure of REPGFs, reducing the issuance rate of green bonds, and bolstering stock price stability, thereby enhancing resilience against capital market volatility. The long-term holdings of green investors send a stability signal to the market, promoting an upgrade in the credit ratings of REPGFs and subsequently reducing their financing costs.

The financial infusion from green investors supports REPGFs in breaking through high-risk technologies and avoids the interruption of innovation due to short-term profit pressure. The MMFGAREPG is usually accompanied by supporting measures (such as tax credits and priority land use rights), and when combined with the resource integration capabilities of green investors, it reduces policy fluctuations and market access risks. Green investors should advocate for REPGFs to employ derivative tools to mitigate risks and align long-term liabilities with asset cycles, so preventing liquidity crises resulting from short-term borrowing for long-term investments. Green investors would also enhance ESG governance, shape brand value, and build trust with stakeholders (Flammer, 2013; Chi et al., 2023), thereby enhancing the reputation of REPGFs and obtaining product premiums and stakeholder support (Martin and Moser, 2016; Tang and Zhang, 2020; Pastor et al., 2021). The preceding analysis gives rise to the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 4: The implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the resilience of REPGFs by attracting green investors.

Sample construction

The MMFGAREPG applies to renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean, and hydropower generation. First, information on all listed power generation firms in the electricity industry is collected from the Sina Finance website, involving a total of 76 firms. Subsequently, firms are classed based on the condition that the total power generation from the specified six renewable energy sources, as outlined in the MMFGAREPG, constitutes over 80% of their overall power generation. Firms disclose details regarding their main business operations, as well as the share and revenue proportions of different business segments, in their annual reports. To precisely identify firms affected by the MMFGAREPG, we manually review each firm’s annual report and calculate the ratio of renewable energy power generation across the six designated categories. Ultimately, 32 firms are identified as REPGFs through this manual review process. This classification method ensures that REPGFs exhibit the essential characteristics of renewable energy power generation. Furthermore, it highlights notable disparities in the impact of the MMFGAREPG on REPGFs and non-REPGFs.

The sales revenue and stock returns of REPGFs, along with other firm-level data included in this paper, are all sourced from the CSMAR and Wind databases. The digital economy index is derived from the China City Statistical Yearbook and the Peking University Digital Inclusive Finance Index, while the green finance development index is obtained from the China City Statistical Yearbook and the Environmental Status Bulletin. Ultimately, after excluding missing data, 1071 firm-year observations are acquired, with the sample period spanning from 2007 to 2023.

Model and variables

We utilize the following model to validate the influence of the MMFGAREPG’s implementation on the resilience of REPGFs:

$${{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\beta {{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(1)

where \({\rm{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}\) indicates the resilience of firm \(i\) in year \(t\). Firms with robust resilience typically demonstrate sustained high-speed growth alongside lower-risk attributes. Consequently, firm resilience can be characterized by two dimensions: high-performance growth and low financial volatility. Drawing on the methodology of Ortiz‐de‐Mandojana and Bansal (2016), we employ the year-on-year growth rate of sales revenue as a proxy for high-performance growth and stock return volatility as an indicator of low financial volatility. We calculate the weights of these two indicators utilizing the entropy method to obtain a comprehensive score that reflects firm resilience. Initially, we standardize the year-on-year growth rate of sales revenue and the volatility of stock returns. Subsequently, we compute the proportions and information entropy values of these indicators to ascertain their respective contributions and weights. Finally, we aggregate these weighted contributions into a composite score that acts as an indicator of firm resilience. The growth in a firm’s revenue signifies its market penetration capability and sensitivity to policy changes, thereby directly indicating business resilience. Meanwhile, stock price volatility functions as a measure of investors’ risk perception, encompassing factors like technological uncertainty or policy fluctuations, making it particularly relevant for firms with high policy dependence.

The entropy method, a multi-index evaluation approach grounded in information theory, quantifies a firm’s risk resistance by calculating the information entropy of diverse indicators. The entropy value automatically adjusts the weight in response to the market environment, exemplifying dynamic adaptability. The entropy method is widely used in the analysis of complex systems within the energy economy sector, owing to its distinctive benefits in managing nonlinear and high-dimensional data. We control for the firm fixed effects to address firm-level factors that remain constant across time and to prevent omitted variable bias. We also control for the year fixed effects to absorb macroeconomic shocks (such as the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19) and isolate the impact of policy changes.

\({\rm{TREAT}}\) takes a value of 1 for REPGFs defined as in Section “Sample construction” and a value of 0 for other power generation firms. \({\rm{POST}}\) takes 1 for the years 2016 and beyond; otherwise, it is 0. The coefficient of \({\rm{TREAT\times POST}}\) reflects the impact of the implementation of the MMFGAREPG on the resilience of REPGFs. The following variables that may affect the resilience of firms are controlled: Firm size (SIZE), large firms may experience economies of scale, allowing them to spread fixed costs and lower unit costs, thus gaining an edge in price competition or during a downturn in demand. At the same time, large firms may possess greater resources to deal with crises. Firm age (AGE), older firms may have accumulated rich experience and resources, established stable customer relationships, and developed resilient supply systems, which enable them to endure risks. Leverage ratio (LEV), a high leverage ratio may increase financial risks, especially during economic recessions. The interest burden may increase, leading to constrained cash flow and the potential risk of bankruptcy. Return on assets (ROA), firms with higher ROA have superior operational efficiency and profitability, which may bolster their ability to withstand risks, as substantial profits might furnish more internal financial buffers. Number of board members (BOARD), the size of the board of directors may affect decision-making efficiency. A greater quantity may yield more diverse perspectives, which is advantageous for a thorough assessment of risks. The shareholding ratio of the largest shareholder (TOP1), coupled with a highly concentrated equity structure, may enhance the largest shareholder’s incentive to supervise management and ensure the firm’s stable operation. However, an excessively high shareholding ratio may result in the predominant shareholder’s arbitrary behavior, neglecting the interests of minority shareholders, and potentially facilitating interest transfer, heightening corporate governance risks and undermining resilience. The book-to-market ratio (BM), a high book-to-market ratio may reflect the market’s pessimistic expectations for the firm’s prospects. Such firms may be undervalued during a crisis; nevertheless, if their fundamentals are solid, they may exhibit superior performance throughout the recovery phase. Fixed assets ratio (FIXED), a high proportion of fixed assets may imply higher sunk costs, hindering rapid adjustments to the asset structure during industrial downturns, and thereby diminishing resilience.

Descriptive statistics

In Table 1, the resilience scores at the 10th and 90th percentiles for the sample firms are 0.0225 and 0.8573, respectively, with a standard deviation of 0.3863. This indicates a low average resilience level and considerable variation among different REPGFs. The average asset return rate of the sample firms is 0.0160, suggesting a relatively low profitability for REPGFs. The average financial slack level is 0.0798, signifying a low proportion of cash and cash equivalents for REPGFs. The average proportion of green investors’ holdings in the sampled firms is 0.0912, suggesting that the appeal of REPGFs to green investors is still quite low. Significant potential exists for augmenting the resilience of REPGFs by attracting a greater number of green investors. The Table A1 of the appendix details the variable definitions.

Baseline regression results

Table 2 illustrates the impact of the MMFGAREPG’s implementation on the resilience of REPGFs. In Column (2), the coefficients of TREAT × POST indicate that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the resilience of REPGFs. Countries worldwide widely adopt REPPSPs to support the development of REPGFs. The coefficient of TREAT × POST in column (4) signifies that the implementation of MMFGAREPG leads to an average increase of 0.0385 in the resilience of REPGFs, equivalent to 10% of the sample mean.

Zhao et al. (2014) and Nicolini and Tavoni (2017) have pointed out that REPPSPs substantially enhance the installed capacity of renewable energy and facilitate technological dissemination. We confirm the beneficial impact of this policy from the perspective of micro-firm resilience while elucidating its underlying mechanism. Current research underscores the direct motivation provided by subsidies for capacity augmentation, whereas we demonstrate that REPPSPs indirectly bolster industry stability by enhancing the risk-buffering capabilities of REPGFs, therefore elucidating the divergence in policy transmission logic. The results indicate that the model combining guaranteed acquisition of electricity and market trading of electricity, as highlighted by MMFGAREPG, improves the ability of REPGFs to cope with risk shocks. In light of this, amid an increasing subsidy gap, regulators may consider a dual-track financing model comprising “subsidy funds + green certificate trading.” REPGFs with green certificates are more apt to attract environmentally conscious investments, while green certificates contribute to cultivating a sustainable brand image and bolstering competitiveness.

The coefficients of SIZE indicate that larger-scale REPGFs demonstrate greater resilience, are more prone to scale effects, exhibit superior business performance, and have the ability to cope with risk shocks, culminating in stronger resilience. The coefficients of AGE indicate that older REPGFs may have more mature business models and enhanced market competitiveness, thus possessing stronger resilience. The coefficients of LEV confirm the lower resilience of REPGFs with higher debt levels. A higher level of debt decreases firms’ capacity to handle risk shocks, escalates their operating costs, and undermines their resilience. The coefficients of BOARD may validate the supervisory role of a diversified board of directors in bolstering firm resilience. Meanwhile, the coefficients of BM reflect that firms with a higher book-to-market ratio demonstrate greater resilience.

Robustness tests

Parallel trend test

The reliability of the baseline regression outcomes depends on the alignment of resilience trends between the treatment and control groups before the implementation of the MMFGAREPG. The following model is constructed to validate the above trend:

$${{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\mathop{\sum }\limits_{-4}^{4}{\beta }_{k}{{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}^{k}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(2)

where \({\sum }_{-4}^{-1}{\rm{POST}}_{t}^{k}\) and \({\sum }_{1}^{4}{\rm{POST}}_{t}^{k}\) represent the values of 1 for REPGFs before and after \(k\) years of the implementation of the MMFGAREPG, respectively; otherwise, they are 0. The first year of the sample is designated as the base period. In Fig. 2, the coefficients of \({\sum }_{-4}^{-1}{\rm{POST}}_{t}^{k}\) are insignificant, while those of \({\sum }_{1}^{4}{\rm{POST}}_{t}^{k}\) are significant and positive, indicating that the resilience of REPGFs compared to other firms remains largely unchanged before the implementation of the MMFGAREPG, thus verifying the parallel trend.

Alternative measures of firm resilience

This section evaluates firm resilience across three dimensions: profitability, growth ability, and debt-paying ability. Profitability encompasses return on equity, return on total assets, and net profit from sales; growth ability comprises the year-on-year growth rates of operational revenue and net profit; and debt-paying ability includes the ratio of net cash flow to liabilities. Profitability, growth ability, and debt-paying ability reflect a firm’s ability to manage risk shocks from different aspects. The entropy method is adopted to calculate the weights of the above indicators, resulting in a comprehensive indicator that serves as a proxy for firm resilience (RESILENCE1). The resilience indicators in the baseline regression are replaced with new proxy indicators for firm resilience, and Eq. (1) is re-estimated. The coefficients of TREAT × POST in Table 3 demonstrate that the resilience of REPGFs markedly improves after the implementation of the MMFGAREPG. The above results confirm that the baseline regression conclusion remains valid after replacing the proxy indicator of firm resilience.

Changing the screening criteria for REPGFs

In this section, firms whose total power generation from the six specified renewable energy sources, consistent with the MMFGAREPG, exceeds 60% of their total power generation are classified as REPGFs. This classification seeks to further examine whether the resilience of REPGFs and other power generation firms has undergone significant changes subsequent to the implementation of the MMFGAREPG. The coefficients of TREAT × POST in Table 4 align with the findings in Section “Baseline regression results”, indicating that firms primarily generating power from renewable energy are considerably and positively affected by the MMFGAREPG.

Propensity score matching

To address potential issues associated with sample selection bias, the propensity score matching (PSM) method is employed. Specifically, propensity score values are calculated using a logit model with control variables as covariates. Subsequently, the caliper nearest neighbor matching technique is utilized to identify firms in the control group, thereby constructing a new matched sample. This new sample is then used to re-estimate Eq. (1). As shown in Table 5, the treatment and control groups exhibit comparable characteristics after matching. Furthermore, the coefficients of TREAT × POST presented in Table 6 provide additional evidence supporting the robustness of the findings, confirming that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the resilience of REPGFs.

Placebo test

To mitigate the effects of unobservable factors or omitted variables on the baseline regression, treatment and control groups are randomly generated from the total sample, and 500 regressions are conducted to derive the kernel density estimation distribution depicted in Fig. 3. The coefficient estimates in Fig. 3 are centered around zero and follow a normal distribution, indicating that unobservable factors or omitted variables are unlikely to affect the results.

The financing channel

Due to a lack of market competitiveness, renewable energy electricity experiences sluggish sales, which in turn affects REPGFs’ cash flow and normal production and operation activities. The poor operating conditions of REPGFs exacerbate their financing difficulties, creating a vicious cycle. The MMFGAREPG mandates the complete acquisition of on-grid electricity from renewable energy power generation projects. This policy effectively addresses the issue of slow sales of renewable energy electricity; it enhances the operating conditions of REPGFs, increases their financial slack, and ultimately enhances their resilience. In this study, the following models are estimated to validate the financing channel through which the MMFGAREPG affects the resilience of REPGFs:

$${{FS}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\beta {{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(3)

$${{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\lambda {{FS}}_{i,t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(4)

$${{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\mu {{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}+{\mu }_{1}{{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}\times {{FS}}_{i,t}+{\mu }_{2}{{FS}}_{i,t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(5)

where \(F{S}_{i,t}\) indicates the financial slack of firm \(i\) in year \(t\). Referring to the research of Bhandari and Javakhadze (2017), the proportion of cash and cash equivalents relative to total assets serves as a proxy variable for firm financial slack. The coefficients of TREAT × POST in Table 7 indicate that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG leads to an average increase of 0.0150 in the financial slack of REPGFs, equivalent to 18.7% of the sample mean. The coefficients of FS indicate a positive correlation between the financial slack of REPGFs and their resilience. The coefficients of TREAT × POST × FS indicate the impact of the MMFGAREPG on the resilience of REPGFs is more pronounced compared to those with a lower degree of financial slack. According to the above results, the MMFGAREPG makes REPGFs more resilient by increasing their financial slack. This finding proves the proposed hypothesis about the financing channel.

Klemun and Trancik (2020) emphasize that feed-in tariffs (FIT) subsidies facilitate bank credit and equity investment by stabilizing revenue expectations, mitigating project risks, and enhancing corporate credit ratings, thereby effectively alleviating the financing constraints faced by firms. These insights align with the conclusion of this paper, which posits that the MMFGAREPG enhances the financial stability of REPGFs. Collectively, these findings suggest that REPPSPs can serve as a critical institutional mechanism to promote the sustainable development of REPGFs by addressing their financing challenges. This study provides a robust theoretical foundation for policymakers to utilize policy instruments in alleviating the financing constraints of REPGFs, thereby fostering the sustainable development of the renewable energy generation sector.

The efficiency channel

The MMFGAREPG mandates a full guarantee for the acquisition of renewable energy-generated power and permits firms to secure contracts for excess electricity via market competition. Furthermore, these contracts are granted priority dispatch by power grid firms during their execution. Such regulations may encourage REPGFs to enhance their power generation efficiency, thereby increasing power output and achieving higher profitability. Based on this premise, we examine the innovation efficiency channel through which the implementation of the MMFGAREPG affects the resilience of REPGFs using the models outlined below:

$${{INNOE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\beta {{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(6)

$${{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\lambda {{INNOE}}_{i,t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(7)

$$\begin{array}{l}{{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\mu {{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}+{\mu }_{1}{{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}\\\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad \times\,{{INNOE}}_{i,t}+{\mu }_{2}{{INNOE}}_{i,t}\\\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad+\,\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}\end{array}$$

(8)

where \({\rm{INNOE}}_{i,t}\) represents the innovation efficiency of firm \(i\) in year \(t\). Innovation efficiency is quantified by the ratio of the number of patents to the natural logarithm of R&D expenditure, with 1 added to the expenditure value. The coefficients of TREAT × POST in Table 8 indicate that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG leads to an average increase of 0.0373 in the innovation efficiency of REPGFs, equivalent to 21.8% of the sample mean. The coefficients of INNOE indicate a positive correlation between innovation efficiency and the resilience of REPGFs. The coefficient of TREAT × POST × INNOE suggests that the impact of the MMFGAREPG on the resilience of REPGFs is more pronounced than that of firms with lower innovation efficiency. The results reveal that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG enhances the innovation efficiency of REPGFs, which in turn increases their resilience, thereby validating the efficiency channel.

Borenstein (2012) asserts that market competition compels firms to enhance technological efficiency. The above research places greater emphasis on the “survival-driven effect,” suggesting that excessive competition may compress the space for R&D investment and have a crowding-out effect on innovation. The results indicate that the combination of financial subsidies and market competition can promote the intrinsic innovation motivation of REPGFs and thereby enhance their resilience. Unlike the internal mechanism of the “survival-driven effect” proposed by Borenstein (2012), the findings emphasize the intrinsic innovation motivation of REPGFs on the basis of maintaining survival. Regulators can stimulate the intrinsic innovation motivation of REPGFs by optimizing the model that combines guaranteed acquisition of electricity and market trading of electricity, and actively shape the market structure to avoid innovation crowding-out.

The fundamental channel

The MMFGAREPG releases positive signals about REPGFs to the market, attracting further green investors. Green investors mitigate information asymmetry between REPGFs and stakeholders, secure essential resources for business development, and reduce the stock price volatility of REPGFs, thereby enhancing their capacity to manage risk shocks and improve resilience. Therefore, we infer that the MMFGAREPG can improve the fundamentals of REPGFs and enhance their resilience by attracting more green investors. We develop the following models to examine the fundamental channel by which the implementation of the MMFGAREPG affects the resilience of REPGFs:

$${{GI}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\beta {{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(9)

$${{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\lambda {{GI}}_{i,t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$$

(10)

$${\begin{array}{ll}{{RESILIENCE}}_{i,t}=\alpha +\mu {{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}+{\mu }_{1}{{TREAT}}_{i}\times {{POST}}_{t}\times {{GI}}_{i,t}+{\mu }_{2}{{GI}}_{i,t}+\gamma {{Controls}}_{i,t}+{\eta }_{i}+{\theta }_{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t} \end{array}}$$

(11)

where \({\rm{GI}}_{i,t}\) is the natural logarithm of 1 added to the number of green funds holding firm \(i\) in the year \(t\). We qualify a fund as a green fund by analyzing its subject information for the presence of sustainability-related keywords. The coefficients of TREAT × POST in Table 9 indicate that implementation of the MMFGAREPG leads to an average increase of 0.0242 in the green investors of REPGFs, equivalent to 26.5% of the sample mean. The coefficients of GI indicate a positive correlation between green investors and the resilience of REPGFs. Furthermore, the coefficient of TREAT × POST × GI signifies that the impact of the MMFGAREPG on the resilience of REPGFs is more significant compared to those with fewer green investors. The results presented above demonstrate that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG attracts more green investors to REPGFs, enhancing their resilience and validating the fundamental channel.

Tang and Zhang (2020) assert that green investors contribute to the improvement of the stock liquidity of REPGFs. The results offer novel evidence illustrating the long-term positive impact of green investors on REPGFs, thereby expanding upon the research conducted by Tang and Zhang (2020). We also offer micro-level evidence about the role of green capital in promoting the sustainable development of the renewable energy industry. Regulators may effectively guide green capital into the renewable energy sector through a comprehensive policy framework and enhance its role as a value investor. REPGFs can draw green capital and obtain long-term stable financial support by enhancing transparency and ESG performance, among other strategies.

Digital economy

In regions with a well-developed digital economy, REPGFs may leverage big data, the Internet of Things, and other technologies to optimize power generation forecasting, equipment maintenance, energy storage, etc., thereby enhancing efficiency and diminishing volatility. In conjunction with the stable income generated by guaranteed purchase policies, REPGFs can more effectively strategize long-term investments and enhance their financial and technical resilience. Advanced smart grids in these regions can monitor and dispatch electricity in real time, while the guaranteed purchase policy ensures the absorption of renewable energy power. Smart grid technology can more efficiently integrate this power, minimizing electricity waste. This approach improves the operational efficiency and market access capabilities of REPGFs, enhancing their resilience. These regions may possess more sophisticated data platforms that deliver real-time market information, aiding REPGFs in accurately predicting market demand and price fluctuations. The guaranteed purchase reduces income uncertainty, while data tools assist REPGFs in enhancing resilience in domains such as cost control and risk management.

In regions with a well-developed digital economy, there is typically greater technological innovation and knowledge sharing. REPGFs may more readily access advanced technologies and management practices. The stable environment created by guaranteed purchases can accelerate technical advancements and improve risk management capabilities. The digital economy, characterized by the fluidity of data and the permeability of digital technologies, promotes disruptive innovations in REPGFs in technology research and development, business models, and organizational management. Digital infrastructure enhances the resilience of REPGFs to market volatility and supply chain disruptions. In highly digitalized regions, REPGFs can rapidly assimilate data flows and modify production strategies, thereby developing “dynamic capabilities” that allow them to sustain resilience against energy price volatility or policy alterations while simultaneously augmenting their competitive edge in the market. Therefore, for REPGFs located in regions with a well-developed digital economy, the implementation of MMFGAREPG may yield a more pronounced impact on their resilience.

The entropy method is applied to four primary indicators—digital infrastructure construction, digital industry, industrial digitization, and digital innovation capability—alongside twenty secondary indicators to formulate a comprehensive index that acts as a proxy for the digital economy (DE). We classify the samples into high- and low-level digital economy groups based on whether their levels exceed the median value for each year. As shown in Table 10, the coefficient of TREAT × POST in the high digital economy group exceeds that of the low-level digital economy group, suggesting that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG exerts a more significant positive effect on the resilience of REPGFs in regions with high-level digital economy levels.

Brynjolfsson and McElheran (2016) argue that big data and AI technologies improve firms’ capabilities in demand forecasting, equipment operation and maintenance, and risk management, thereby enhancing operational resilience. The findings provide novel micro-level evidence regarding the supportive function of regional digital infrastructure in bolstering the REPGFs’ risk-resistance capabilities and further reveal how the maturity of the regional digital economy, as a key environmental factor, significantly amplifies the positive effects of policy intervention (MMFGAREPG). We also extend the impact of the digital economy on physical firms to encompass the renewable energy generation sector. Regulators should incorporate digitalization into green financial support, increase investment in regional digital infrastructure, and foster the coordinated advancement of policies and digital infrastructure.

Green development

In regions with higher levels of green development, governments typically prioritize environmental sustainability, providing robust legislative support and imposing stringent fines for corporate pollution emissions. Renewable energy power generation can effectively diminish carbon emissions by substituting traditional thermal power generation and is projected to garner substantial support from local governments, including policy subsidies and loans. Regions with a high level of green development may possess more sophisticated carbon trading markets, allowing firms to earn additional income by selling carbon quotas. This, together with the consistent profits from assured purchases, bolsters their financial resiliency. Moreover, the clustering of green technologies may promote technology sharing and innovation among firms, reducing R&D costs and improving technological resilience.

We examine three dimensions: the degree of economic growth, resource and environmental carrying capacity, and government policy support. These dimensions encompass nine secondary indicators, including the green growth efficiency index, resource and ecological protection index, green investment index, and environmental governance index, as well as 53 tertiary indicators. The entropy method is utilized on the specified indicators to derive a comprehensive index (GD) as a proxy for the green development level. We classify the samples into high- and low-level green development groups based on their green development levels relative to the annual median value. In Table 11, the coefficient of TREAT × POST in the high-level green development group is larger than that in the low-level green development group.

The above results imply that implementing MMFGAREPG significantly enhances the resilience of REPGFs in areas characterized by higher levels of green development. The findings greatly align with the macro impact proposed by Aghion et al. (2016) that green policies mitigate risks in the new energy industry. However, the breakthrough of this study lies in revealing the specific transmission path through micro-firm data, thereby filling the empirical gap in the implementation effect of policies. Promoting green development facilitates the nonlinear positive impact of the MMFGAREPG on the resilience of REPGFs.

ESG performance

The resource-based view theory posits that ESG performance constitutes the “intangible strategic resources” amassed by firms. Firms with better ESG performance are more likely to gain support from key stakeholders and serve as an “accelerator” for policy implementation. REPGFs with better ESG performance are more inclined to obtain low-cost green financing, including green bonds and ESG-themed funds. The stable revenue stream from fully guaranteed purchases can act as a credit endorsement, further reducing the financing risk premium. The certainty of policy guarantees, combined with ESG reputation, creates a “double credit enhancement” effect, markedly improving the financial resilience of REPGFs. REPGFs exhibiting better ESG performance are more likely to receive priority support from the government, community recognition, and long-term procurement commitments from customers. REPGFs with better ESG performance usually possess more comprehensive internal control systems, can quickly adapt to policy changes (such as flexibly adjusting power generation plans), and efficiently allocate resources, thus demonstrating stronger resilience. The implementation of MMFGAREPG could potentially enhance the resilience of REPGFs with better ESG performance.

We use the Huazheng ESG score to measure a firm’s ESG performance. Samples are divided into better and worse ESG performance groups based on whether their ESG scores exceed or fall below the median value for each year. Table 12 demonstrates that the coefficient of TREAT × POST in the better ESG performance group exceeds that of the worse ESG performance group, indicating that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG exerts a more pronounced influence on the resilience of REPGFs with better ESG performance.

Superior environmental performance, exemplified by the application of low-carbon technologies, can reduce policy risks, including carbon taxes and environmental fines, while also improving energy efficiency (Fatemi et al., 2018). For instance, REPGFs attract green investors through ESG disclosures and improve financing conditions. Prior studies have inadequately addressed the impact of ESG factors within the renewable energy industry. For the first time, we present micro-level evidence demonstrating that, in the renewable energy power generation sector, adherence to ESG obligations serves not merely as a compliance necessity but also as a strategic measure for enhancing resilience. This discovery transcends the cognitive limitation established by Fatemi et al. (2018) concerning the universal value of environmental performance. The active fulfillment of ESG responsibilities and improvement of ESG performance by REPGFs help them obtain more resources and support from stakeholders essential for development, thereby augmenting their ability to cope with risk shocks.

Regional heterogeneity

There are significant differences among various regions in China in terms of economic development, policy measures, and resource endowments. In the western regions, the amalgamation of subsidies and resource advantages leads to high power generation efficiency and low unit costs, facilitating the attainment of economies of scale for REPGFs and exhibiting enhanced resilience. In the eastern regions, subsidies are relied upon to compensate for resource deficiencies; yet, proximity to consumer markets necessitates a balance between reliance on subsidies and the benefits of grid connection. The eastern regions have strong local fiscal support capabilities, and the coordination of supporting policies, such as tax exemptions and land preferences, with central subsidies bolsters the risk-resistance of REPGFs. In the western regions, subsidies may emerge as the primary income source, but local support is insufficient, and delayed subsidies could precipitate liquidity crises for REPGFs, posing challenges to their resilience after the subsidy phase-out. The timeliness and transparency of subsidy distribution in the eastern regions affect the stability of REPGFs’ capital chains. The legislative framework in the eastern regions is supportive, and the synergistic interaction among subsidies, carbon trading mechanisms, and green certificate markets enhances the long-term competitiveness of REPGFs. Based on this, we hypothesize that the impact of the MMFGAREPG’s implementation on the resilience of REPGFs may vary across different regional REPGFs.

We categorize the samples into eastern and western regions according to the locations of the REPGFs and perform regressions on Eq. (1) separately. As shown in Table 13, the absolute value of the coefficient of\(TREAT\times POST\) in the eastern region sample is larger, indicating that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG has a more substantial impact on enhancing the resilience of REPGFs in the eastern region.

Zhao et al. (2016) indicate that the eastern power grid possesses a superior capacity for power accommodation, facilitating a more efficient implementation of the guaranteed purchase policy. This mitigates the risk of cash flow disruption caused by the abandonment of wind and solar energy. Furthermore, local governments in the eastern region have reinforced the policy’s effectiveness by providing supplementary subsidies and tax incentives, thereby directly enhancing the risk-resistance capabilities of REPGFs. The findings echo those of Zhao et al. (2016) regarding the effect of the guaranteed purchase policy on augmenting the consumption capacity of the eastern power grid. The implementation of the MMFGAREPG should consider regional disparities, enhance focus on the western regions, and mandate local governments in those areas to furnish appropriate policy and infrastructural support.

Renewable energy power generation corresponds with the concept of green development and has emerged as the future trajectory of the power industry. Countries worldwide have implemented REPPSPs to support the development of renewable electricity and lower carbon emissions by switching from conventional energy sources to renewable energy production. Although REPPSPs can alleviate the funding deficit of REPGFs, their comparatively high generation costs diminish market competitiveness, hence presenting a significant obstacle to their sustained development. Therefore, elucidating the influence of REPPSPs on the resilience of REPGFs is critical for optimizing the policy’s positive role in fostering their sustainability.

We demonstrate that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG markedly enhances the resilience of REPGFs. Specifically, this policy not only increases financial slack for REPGFs but also improves their innovation efficiency and draws more green investors to these firms, thereby enhancing their resilience. Moreover, the heterogeneity test results indicate that the implementation of the MMFGAREPG exerts a more pronounced positive effect on the resilience of REPGFs with better ESG performance, as well as those situated in eastern regions and areas characterized by a well-developed digital economy and green development.

The conclusion provides policy insights for guiding regulatory authorities to promote the better development of REPGFs. Regulatory authorities should continue to improve the MMFGAREPG, combine price guarantee acquisition with market competition mechanisms, and employ these mechanisms to stimulate innovation among REPGFs. Regulators can promote the synergy between digitalized power grids and the full guarantee purchase policy. For instance, they can optimize renewable energy consumption through smart grids and power big data platforms, thus minimizing the curtailment of wind and solar electricity. They can also support the application of blockchain technology in the traceability and trading of green electricity. A connection should be established between the full guarantee purchase policy and local green finance policies (such as green credit interest subsidies and carbon emission rights trading), and the infrastructure for cross-regional power allocation should be improved to ensure the transmission capacity of renewable energy. ESG indicators should be incorporated into the priority assessment system of the full guarantee purchase policy, offering preferential power price subsidies and quota allocations to firms with elevated ESG ratings, thereby fostering healthy competition within the sector.

For REPGFs located in regions with relatively lower levels of digital economy and green development, they can actively fulfill their ESG responsibilities to secure greater support from stakeholders. These firms can pursue low-cost digital transformation strategies, collaborate with firms or technology providers in regions characterized by advanced digital economies to obtain technical support, participate in cross-regional green power transactions, and sell electricity to regions with higher demand. Such measures can enhance revenue stability. Additionally, these REPGFs can proactively apply for green subsidies and tax incentives from local governments while advocating for policy support that facilitates cross-regional cooperation and technology transfer. For example, they can negotiate with local governments to integrate renewable energy projects into local infrastructure construction initiatives, thereby securing additional resources.

Investors can prioritize REPGFs in regions with advanced digital economies, as these firms are more resilient under MMFGAREPG and have lower policy dependency. They should comprehensively assess the technological iteration capabilities and market-oriented transformation potential of these firms. Investors may consider the ESG performance of REPGFs as a fundamental criterion for investment decisions, as REPGFs exhibiting better ESG performance are more likely to obtain policy backing and long-term financing advantages.

The study exclusively focuses on REPPSPs, disregarding other renewable energy power generation policies, which may impose certain constraints. Green power certificates enable firms to shape a green and environmentally friendly brand image, improve competitiveness, attract more consumers, and earn additional profits through trade. Therefore, exploring the combined impact of REPPSPs and other policies (e.g., green power certificates) or analyzing the long-term implications of these policies on the sustainability of REPGFs are valuable directions for future research.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-06055-5/MediaObjects/41599_2025_6055_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-11-20 13:02:33.801916

The Total Sales Forecast

Total new-vehicle sales for November 2025, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 1,255,900, a 5.2% decrease year over year, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData. November 2025 has 25 selling days, one fewer than November 2024.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 15.4 million units, down 1.2 million units from November 2024.

The Retail Sales Forecast

New-vehicle retail sales for November 2025 are projected to reach 1,058,500, a 4.8% decrease from November 2024.

The Takeaways

Thomas King, president of OEM solutions at J.D. Power:

“November’s results reflect another notable—yet anticipated—decline in the new-vehicle sales pace, driven largely by the pull-ahead of electric vehicle (EV) purchases prior to the expiration of federal EV tax credits on Sept. 30. That expiration prompted many shoppers to accelerate buying decisions, resulting in a surge in EV sales that temporarily inflated the overall industry sales pace. Now, two months after the credit expired, the industry continues to feel the effect of those accelerated purchases. In November, EVs are expected to account for just 6.0% of new-vehicle retail sales, consistent with October but well below the 12.9% recorded in September.

“Automakers are recalibrating pricing strategies following the expiration of EV tax credits, tariff dynamics and evolving fuel economy requirements, along with the transition to the new model year. These factors create some distortions in typical seasonal discount patterns. Discounts on EVs are expected to average $11,869 in November, up $260 from November 2024 but down $928 from October 2025. Discounts on non-EVs are projected at $2,960, an increase of $161 from a year ago.

“The average manufacturer's incentive spend per vehicle is on track to reach $3,211, which is $375 higher than October but $125 lower than a year ago. The year-over-year decline in incentive spending is mostly due to sales shifting away from heavily discounted EVs and moving towards non-EVs with much lower discounts. The declining percentage of vehicles leased compared to a year ago is adding secondary pressure to lower incentive spending. Leasing is expected to decline 2.7 percentage points from November 2024, reaching 20.5% of sales. EV manufacturers have heavily relied on leasing to allow consumers to benefit from the EV tax credit, but EV leasing has declined 12.0 percentage points from November 2024, trending at 54%. A lower percentage of EV leases combined with a lower percentage of EV sales is driving incentive spending down from a year ago.

“Affordability pressures remain, with monthly finance payments reaching a record for the month of November at $760. In response, more consumers are turning to extended 84-month loan terms, which are expected to account for 11.1% of financed sales this month—nearing the highest level on record for the month of November set in 2022. The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in November is expected to reach $46,029, up $722 or 1.6% from November 2024.

“Easing interest rates and strong used-vehicle values—reflected in higher trade-in equity—are providing meaningful relief to buyers facing elevated monthly payments.”

The average interest rate for new-vehicle loans in November is 6.05%, a decrease of 27 basis points from a year ago.

“The average used-vehicle price is trending toward $29,696, up $725 from a year ago. This reflects the combination of reduced supply of recent model-year used vehicles due to lower new-vehicle production during the pandemic, fewer lease maturities and manufacturers moderating discounts. The rise in used-vehicle prices is good news for new-vehicle buyers with a trade-in, although average trade-in equity in November is down a modest $111 year over year to $7,822. The number of new-vehicle buyers with negative equity on their trade-in is expected to reach 26.9%—an increase of 3.3 percentage points from November 2024. Although negative equity is rising, it remains below the peak November level of 32.9% recorded in 2019.

“Elevated transaction prices in November are not enough to offset the lower sales pace, with consumers on track to spend nearly $46.8 billion on new vehicles this month—6.4% lower than a year ago. Total retailer profit per unit—which includes vehicle gross plus finance and insurance income—is expected to be $2,161, up $6 from November 2024 and down $54 from October 2025. The improvement in retailer profit per unit is primarily a function of lower EV sales, which typically generate lower retailer profits than non-EVs. Total aggregate retailer profit from new-vehicle sales for this month is projected to be $2.2 billion, down 7.7% from last year.

“Subprime mix had been on a steady upward trajectory this year, topping out at 9.8% in October, the highest of any month since March 2020. Subprime mix fell slightly from October to 8.9% in November, still 2.8 percentage points higher than November 2024.

“The industry enters the holiday sales season facing a mix of affordability challenges, evolving incentive strategies and lingering effects from the EV pull-ahead earlier this year. While interest rates have eased and used-vehicle values remain strong—providing some support for trade-in equity—the number of leases set to expire in December is projected to be more than 15% lower than the same period a year ago and 50% lower than in 2023, thus limiting the typical year-end boost. Automakers are expected to maintain disciplined pricing and restrained incentives, particularly in non-EV segments, as they balance profitability with the need to stimulate demand. How aggressively manufacturers choose to adjust discounting and promotional activity during December will be critical in shaping the close of 2025.”

“The electric vehicle (EV) market is entering a new phase following the end of federal incentives, with November data signaling a shift in consumer behavior and industry dynamics. EV retail share has stabilized at 6.0%, flat from October but notably lower than last year’s 9.6%. Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have seen an even steeper decline, dropping to 1.1% from 2.5% a year ago, underscoring the challenges facing electrified powertrains in a post-incentive environment.

“Pricing trends further highlight the evolving landscape. EV transaction prices have surged by $6,500 year over year to $52,400, making them the second most expensive powertrain after PHEVs, which now average $64,300, a jump of $8,400. In contrast, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles average $46,000, while traditional hybrids remain the most affordable option at $42,200. Despite these price increases, automakers continue to rely heavily on incentives to drive EV sales, with average support of $6,220 per vehicle, the highest among all powertrains.

“Leasing remains a critical lever for EV adoption, with 54% of EV transactions occurring through leases, far outpacing ICE vehicles at 20% and hybrids at 15%. While EV incentive spending has moderated compared to a year ago, the reliance on leasing and discounts underscores the challenges automakers face. As the market adjusts to life without federal tax credits, manufacturers will need to rethink go-to-market strategies to balance affordability, profitability, and consumer demand in this new paradigm.”

Global Sales Outlook

David Oakley, manager, Americas vehicle sales forecasts at GlobalData:

“October global light-vehicle sales are estimated to have increased 3.1% year over year to 8.2 million units, despite some mixed results across major regions. The selling rate for October was estimated at 95.9 million units, up from a downwardly revised 92.3 million units in September.

“China, India and Europe contributed the most to year over year sales gains in October. Although government subsidies and tax incentives in China are being wound down, there was still sufficient demand to deliver year over year growth in October, with new energy vehicles accounting for more than half of all sales. Tax reductions and holiday sales events spurred strong sales in India. In Europe, sales in Turkey increased sharply as consumers sought to invest in vehicles to guard against inflation.

“November sales are expected to decrease 3.9% from November 2024. In part, this is a reflection of a relatively strong month in November 2024. However, tariff effects and economic uncertainty are expected to play a part in subduing demand in Europe and North America, while China could see a slight slowdown as subsidies ease. The global selling rate is expected to reach 92.7 million units in November, down from a rate of 95.8 million units in November 2024.

“Overall, global trade appears to have stabilized slightly over the past month, with some progress made on resolving the Nexperia chip crisis. Despite some uncertainty remaining over the health of the global economy, we see total 2025 sales at 91.4 million units, up by around 200,000 from our forecast a month ago and representing growth of 3.0% year over year.”

PJM Interconnection, the biggest grid operator in North America, spanning 13 states and Washington, D.C., has been struggling to keep up with booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech’s power-hungry data centers needed for the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.

PJM members, which include power generators, utilities and large energy users, cast votes on Wednesday that rejected about a dozen proposals aimed at quickly linking up data centers to the PJM grid while attempting to reduce the reliability risks of doing so. Following the results, representatives of the PJM Board of Managers said they still intended to advance a plan to handle its surging data center interconnection requests and aimed to finalize it by December.

Earlier proposals for the so-called “Critical Issue Fast Path” required data center developers to bring their own power supplies and shut off operations during energy emergencies, including when electricity use surges on very hot and cold days. Those provisions were removed from later versions of the plan, and it was unclear what a final roadmap for PJM’s handling of data centers would be.

Data centers are expected to account for nearly all of the 32 gigwatts of demand growth PJM forecasts on its system through 2030. Without significantly increasing power supplies, PJM has warned of power shortages in the region as early as 2027.

PJM covers Northern Virginia, which has the biggest global concentration of data centers. Other burgeoning hubs are developing in states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic grid.

The power crunch has sent prices in PJM’s annual capacity auction rising by more than 1,000% over the last two auctions.

The region’s power bills started rising last summer. High prices in the auction are meant to encourage the build out of additional power plants and bring equilibrium to the market, but costs and supply chain problems have contributed to lengthy delays with building new power plants.

The loan, issued through the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), was awarded to Constellation Energy (CEG), the nation’s largest nuclear power operator. The unit, which was shut down in 2019 due to economic pressures from cheap natural gas, will be revived under the new name Crane Clean Energy Center.

The revival is largely enabled by a 20-year, $16 billion power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which is seeking large-scale, carbon-free electricity to power its energy-intensive AI data centers. The deal ensures a stable revenue stream for the project and underscores the growing partnership between Big Tech and nuclear energy.

Following the announcement, Constellation Energy’s stock rose 5% in after-hours trading.

Once operational, the 800-megawatt reactor will supply enough electricity to power approximately 800,000 homes in the PJM Interconnection region, one of the largest U.S. power grids. The project is expected to enhance grid reliability, provide affordable baseload power, and create more than 600 jobs.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the initiative will “provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region” and “help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

Thomas Hochman, Director of Energy & Infrastructure Policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, highlighted the broader significance of the deal. He noted it is the first LPO loan specifically addressing AI-driven electricity load growth and represents a novel partnership model between a tech firm and an energy developer. Hochman also emphasized that the power will flow into the public grid, benefiting all ratepayers and strengthening system-wide reserves.

The project signals a strategic pivot by the U.S. to expand its nuclear energy capacity amid intensifying global competition, particularly with China, which has taken a significant lead in nuclear development. Constellation plans to invest roughly $1.6 billion to bring the reactor back online between 2027 and 2028.

Prime determinants of growth

The rise in the sale of electric vehicles as well as the lack of standardization of EV charging and the greater need for convenience drives the growth of the global portable EV charger market. Limitations associated with the existing electric vehicle charging infrastructure also boost the growth of the portable EV charger market. Greater adoption of portable EV chargers is expected during the forecast period to address range anxiety associated with electric vehicles among consumers. However, the superior cost of portable EV chargers is anticipated to restrict the market growth during the forecast period. Moreover, greater demand for mobile charging as a service and the rise in adoption of shared mobility are expected to present new opportunities in the coming years. Market players are increasingly investing in the development of advanced wireless, bi-directional fast chargers to cater to the growing demand for portable EV chargers during the forecast period.

Covid-19 Scenario

The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic led to the closing of international borders and disruption in the supply chain, which reduced demand for electric vehicles worldwide, thereby leading to decreased demand for portable EV chargers.

The pandemic resulted in a continued reduction in the adoption of portable electric vehicle chargers due to nationwide lockdowns and a slowdown in shipments due to temporary closures of manufacturing facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic halted overall nationwide mobility.

The automotive industry has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disruption negatively impacted the demand for electric vehicles which further reduced the growth of the portable electric vehicle charger market.

However, with ease in COVID-19 restrictions, the global portable EV charger market is expected to experience growth on account of the rise in the adoption of electric vehicles and the introduction of stringent emission regulations by countries across the world.

The DC portable EV charger segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period

Based on type, the DC portable EV charger segment is expected to hold the highest market share in 2025, accounting for nearly three-fourths of the global portable EV charger market, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period. With a DC charger, direct current is supplied directly to the battery, bypassing the onboard charger. DC fast charging is essential for high-mileage heavy vehicles. The rise in the need for portable anytime/anyplace charging drives the growth of DC chargers in the market. It is also projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 20.7% from 2026 to 2035.

The passenger cars segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period

Based on application, the passenger cars segment is expected to account for the largest share in 2025, accounting for more than three-fourths of the global portable EV charger market, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. There is an increase in the development of portable electric vehicle chargers for passenger vehicles to reduce mileage and range anxiety among consumers. The rise in demand for electric passenger vehicles owing to the increase in awareness of environmental impacts due to emissions of greenhouse gases, and the implementation of favorable government policies support the growth of this segment.

There have been 11 GW of batteries and 8 GW of demand response resources added to the bulk power system since last winter, NERC said.
“Essentially, you have a doubling between the last several successive [winter reliability assessments],” said Mark Olson, NERC’s manager of reliability assessment.
Solar nameplate capacity rose 11 GW since last winter, but is expected to contribute only about 1 GW towards meeting peak demand.
In the Maritimes region, imports may be needed to meet peak demand, NERC said.","Dive Brief:

Peak demand on the bulk power system will be 20 GW higher this winter than last, but total resources to meet the peak have only increased 9.4 GW, according to a report released Tuesday by the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

Despite the mismatch, all regions of the bulk power system should have sufficient resources for expected peak demand this winter, NERC said in its 2025-2026 Winter Reliability Assessment. However, several regions could face challenges in the event of extreme weather.

There have been 11 GW of batteries and 8 GW of demand response resources added to the bulk power system since last winter, NERC said. Solar, thermal and hydro have also seen small additions, but contributions from wind resources are 14 GW lower following capacity accounting changes in some markets.

Dive Insight:

NERC officials described a mixed bag heading into the winter season.

“The bulk power system is entering another winter with pockets of elevated risk, and the drivers are becoming more structural than seasonal,” said John Moura, NERC’s director of reliability assessments and performance analysis. “We’re seeing steady demand growth, faster than previous years, landing on a system that’s still racing to build new resources, navigating supply chain constraints and integrating large amounts of variable, inverter-based generation.”

Aggregate peak demand across NERC’s footprint will be 20 GW, or 2.5%, higher than last winter. “Essentially, you have a doubling between the last several successive [winter reliability assessments],” said Mark Olson, NERC’s manager of reliability assessment.

Nearly all of NERC’s assessment areas “are reporting year-on-year demand growth with some forecasting increases near 10%,” the reliability watchdog said.

The U.S. West, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic — areas with significant data center development — have highest growth rates, NERC said. “Demand growth is contributing to lower reserve margins and signaling need for more resources,” according to a presentation on the report.

But some types of new resource additions are slow to come online. Just 3 GW of thermal or hydro generation was added since last winter. Solar nameplate capacity rose 11 GW since last winter, but is expected to contribute only about 1 GW towards meeting peak demand.

Bringing resources online more quickly will require changes to policy and markets, according to the Electric Power Supply Association.

“We need permitting reform, predictable market rules, and policies that support private investment,” EPSA President and CEO Todd Snitchler said in a statement. The group represents competitive generators.

An increasingly complex resource mix “brings additional challenges for operators,” NERC said, particularly in extreme or extended cold weather.

In the Maritimes region, imports may be needed to meet peak demand, NERC said. New England could see gas shortages in extended extreme conditions. In areas of the Southeast, reserves may not be sufficient for high demand scenarios, or resource shortages may occur during early morning hours with high demand.

In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas footprint, “strong load growth is contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls in extreme cold,” NERC said. In parts of the Northwest, resources may not be sufficient during wide-area cold weather that causes thermal plant outages and wind performance issues.

“Winter reliability is improving in some aspects, but the system is still being tested by conditions outside historical norms,” Moura said.

NERC’s assessment includes several recommendations: grid operators should review seasonal operating plans; generation owners should complete winter readiness and weatherization efforts; and balancing authorities should implement generator fuel surveys to monitor the adequacy of fuel supplies.

“Gas production and supplies going to generators strongly impacts how well the bulk power system can perform during winter conditions,” Olson said. “These two systems are inextricably linked.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/zTl-JK6msJj1PKbDkjjwu-lcNJ_LQb7DbDWHdfqJqME/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JY2Vfc3Rvcm0uanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-20 10:01:33.028609

“Toyota’s multi-pathway powertrain approach continues to drive steady growth in electrified vehicles, including hybrids, plug-ins and all-electric, which now account for nearly 50% of the company’s U.S. sales,” the release says.

The Toyota USA Foundation also recently launched Driving Possibilities, its $110 million initiative to support PreK-12 education and beyond.

The long-term program aims to close educational gaps through innovative, hands-on STEM learning while addressing the essential needs of students and families.

Earlier this month, Toyota announced the start of production at its new battery plant in North Carolina, along with a commitment to an additional $10 billion U.S. investment, according to a company press release.

In their minds, she’d been set up for a traditional college experience, leading to a stable government job. But in hers, a desk job was unappealing. She loved working with hair and knew she had the talent and drive to build a serious career in the beauty industry.

But the criticism was intense, complete with warnings that she would bring shame to the family. To appease them, she did everything, at full speed.

After graduating from Kaimuki Christian School, Umebayashi earned an associate degree in cosmetology at Honolulu Community College while training at Marsha Nadalin Salon in Kāhala, where she had worked since she was 15. She also got licensed as a cosmetologist.

She then jumped into business administration at UH Mānoa, packing her schedule with 18 hours of credits each semester, and 12 hours each summer, while continuing to work at the salon. The academic marathon ended with a bachelor’s degree in 2020.

“I wanted to be done with school,” she says. “I was motivated to never step foot in a classroom ever again.”

Her instinct to pursue the trades and specialty skills is shared by many Gen Zers across the country, who are flocking to traditional apprenticeships and trade schools. In Hawai‘i, the trend is less pronounced, but the opportunities are immense. Employers in construction, manufacturing, health care, clean energy and other sectors are eager to hire skilled employees – and they earn higher salaries and carry less debt than many people with four-year degrees.

For Umebayashi, the financial payoff came quickly. At the salon, she worked early mornings to late nights on commission, breaking six figures in annual earnings. She put some of that money into a reduced-priced “workforce” unit at a new high-rise condo in Kaka‘ako, which she was offered in a housing lottery.

In January, at age 27, she became a self-employed stylist, renting space at Oasis Salon in Kaimukī. She says her current pace is less frenetic and better for her work-life balance, but she doesn’t let herself become satisfied or complacent.

“It’s not wise when you’re in your 20s to feel comfortable,” she says. “You should feel uncomfortable, you should take risks. … I thought I would be a millionaire at 25, so I feel like I’m behind. I’ve always had a fire under me.”

Umebayashi is paying off her mortgage as aggressively as possible. Even good debt troubles her, and she takes a very “full throttle, unconventional” approach to investing in hopes of being debt-free and financially secure. She also plans to open a salon of her own.

Despite her restlessness, she realizes she’s in a pretty good spot. She says she sees many of her peers burdened with student loans and struggling to find jobs, with no clear paths forward.

“Our education system makes it seem like college is this great promise to a good life and a good future, but often it can be the opposite,” she says. “You start behind other people who don’t take on debt.”

More money, less debt

From a career perspective, Umebayashi’s skepticism about the benefits of a traditional college experience is not off-base, particularly in Hawai‘i where four-year degrees lead to less income and opportunity than in any other state.

Five years after graduating, only 43% of four-year college graduates in Hawai‘i have jobs that typically require bachelor’s degrees – the lowest percentage in the U.S. – according to a 2024 report from the Strada Education Foundation. Maryland had the highest percentage, at 60%.

And jobs that pay a living wage are scarce. Matt Stevens, a data scientist and executive director of Hawai‘i Workforce Funders Collaborative, says: “We’re 50th in the nation as to how much you can expect to earn at every educational attainment level, adjusted for cost of living. And when you get to the four-year degree, it’s actually off-the-charts low. We’re a statistical outlier.”

The state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations estimates, in uncannily precise terms, that 377,760 jobs will open in Hawai‘i between 2020 and 2030. But less than a third, or 120,290 job openings, are projected to pay at least a “living wage” of $56,841 for a single adult with no children, according to “From Crisis to Opportunity,” a report published in January by the Hawai‘i Workforce Funders Collaborative. The MIT living wage calculator recently upped that amount to $62,234.

The nonprofit collaborative calls attention to the problem of low-quality jobs and advocates for better jobs with better pay. In the process, it brings business, government, nonprofit and educational leaders together to figure out how to do that.

Community colleges in the UH system have responded with a dizzying array of short-term training and credentialing programs alongside core humanities classes and two-year degree programs. Many are new programs developed with input from employers.

“The fact is that a high school diploma is no longer enough. Students have to do something post-graduation, and there are so many options at the community colleges,” says Karen Lee, chancellor of Honolulu Community College. About 3,700 students are enrolled at HCC, which has seen its numbers steadily increase after dropping during the pandemic. That trend is similar across the UH System.

Many practical two-year associate degrees lead to trade careers, viewed broadly as skilled work requiring specialized training and often a license. People straight out of school or training programs can earn $100,000 or more – and live far more comfortable lives than a living wage provides, which would barely cover a decent one-bedroom rental, a compact car and fresh food.

The young pragmatists gravitating to the trades are sometimes called the toolbelt generation, and they’re looking for financial freedom, an escape from office life, and jobs that are less likely to be disrupted by technology and economic downturns.

Mechatronics: demand exceeds supply

In a set of unassuming temporary buildings at Leeward Community College, students are wiring control boxes based on detailed schematics. Other rooms are filled with elaborate machines and tools for learning about sensors, robotics, control systems, computer-integrated machinery and other technology.

William Labby, an assistant professor at LCC, founded the mechatronics program to fill a specific workforce need – technicians to maintain Honolulu’s driverless trains – and it’s since blossomed into a two-year program, leading to an associate of science degree. He chafes at the “trades” label and explains that his students gain high-level math and troubleshooting skills that complement the design skills of engineers.

“Engineers and highly skilled technicians are two sides of the same coin,” he says. “Engineers are design oriented, while technicians deal with installation, maintenance, retooling, reprogramming and all the follow-on functions behind the engineering design.”

About half the mechatronics graduates are hired by Hitachi, which installs and maintains the operating system for Skyline’s trains. For the others, Labby says, companies are coming “out of the woodwork” to talk to his students, with many landing jobs at medical imaging companies, military contractors, Cirque du Soleil and the Ball Corp. in Kapolei. He says new hires at Ball, which makes 12-ounce cans, start out at about $85,000 a year, with lots of overtime opportunities.

“Automation is a growth industry in the state. We’re going to get more and more automated with all of our small food and beverage manufacturing companies,” says Labby. “Most companies would rather hire local, and now that word is getting out about this program, I’m getting more of a push for graduates. Demand exceeds my supply.”

While 22 students are enrolled in the program now, Labby says he has the capacity for 40. The obstacle is high school college counselors. “The message they convey is that if you don’t go to a four-year school, you fail, and that is not the case,” he says.

A fourth-semester student, Christian Smith, just landed a job with a military contractor, and negotiated to work part time until he graduates. Before joining the program, he was a helicopter mechanic with the military, and says he now has “a better, deeper understanding of how things work.”

Another student, Ramsey Agustin, graduated from Damien Memorial School in 2022 and spent his freshman year at Oregon State University studying mechanical engineering. Formidable out-of-state tuition and housing costs forced him to return home.

He’s now completing his final semester in the mechatronics program while also working at a machine shop in Pearl City, and he looks forward to getting a better-paid job soon and eventually finishing his bachelor’s degree.

Agustin finds the classes challenging but manageable. “I haven’t ever felt like we’re being lectured too much, which is helpful,” he says. “About 70% of the classes have been mostly hands-on, which is better for some people. I like it.”

RadTech: a reverse pipeline

More than half of Kapi‘olani Community College’s students move on to four-year universities, says Misaki Takabayashi, the college’s chancellor. But some programs are so sought-after that the pipeline is reversed: people with bachelor’s degrees head to KCC for an additional associate degree.

The radiologic technology program is one of them. Two of the three students I spoke with already had degrees from UH Mānoa: Aura Coffman in animal science and Garrison Hiramatsu in elementary education. Neither felt that their choices suited them, and they were drawn to the prospect of a well-paid career with defined hours and tasks. A third student, Breanne Yang, says she always wanted to work in health care, but got sidetracked in restaurant jobs.

About 25% of applicants are accepted, with decisions based on an admissions test and grades from prerequisite courses taken in their first year. In the second year, selected students focus on how to safely image the human body using X-ray equipment and gain practical experience in health care settings.

Along with respiratory care, radiologic technology is the most popular program in the college’s health care division, and offers the highest pay. The entry-level hourly wage is $45 on O‘ahu, and a technologist with a couple of years’ experience earns about $92,000 annually, according to Program Director Kimberly Suwa. Very experienced or specialized technologists, such as those working in mammography or radiation therapy, earn about $112,000, she says.

When high schoolers tour the campus, those figures usually impress them. “They obviously understand that there is a large discrepancy between what you can make at McDonald’s versus what you can make as a technologist,” Suwa says. “But I don’t know if they fully understand the impact of being able to do a two-year degree as opposed to having to go to a four-year college.”

For one thing, the community colleges in the UH System charge $131 per credit hour for in-state students, or about $2,000 a semester for a full 15-hour course load. Tuition at UH Mānoa is $441 per credit, or about $6,600 per semester for a similar load.

Despite the lower cost, and access to scholarships and federal financial aid, more students than in the past seem to have outside jobs, says Jodi Ann Nakaoka, the chair of KCC’s health sciences department. She says the department cautions students to eliminate or minimize their work hours because the program is intense, but Hawai‘i’s high cost of living increasingly makes that impossible.

AERO: training super mechanics

At the end of Lagoon Drive, a shoreline road snaking along the eastern edge of the Honolulu airport, young men and a handful of women are training to become airplane mechanics at Honolulu Community College’s aeronautics maintenance technology program.

Vintage and modern planes line the perimeter of the building, and engines and tools fill the interior workshops. All of the aircraft have been donated, including a small Cessna 172, a replica of an old crop duster, and a DC-9 with its engine removed but airframe intact.

Teams of students are taking engines apart and putting them back together, and learning how to diagnose and fix problems that the faculty have introduced. Much of the classroom instruction gets translated into projects, such as constructing a cross-section of a plane’s wing based on blueprints.

Instructor Brian Quinto drills the students on the importance of safety and attention to detail. “We’re often compared to auto mechanics. No denigration to them, but if something goes wrong with your car, you just pull over.” Signing off on repairs becomes a legal document, he explains to students, and planes aren’t cleared to take off until the mechanic says so.

Andy Tran, a second-year student in the program, says “there’s a big learning curve for the program. The more I learn, the harder it is to fix things.”

“Many of the new students are like deer in the headlights because it comes at you really fast, but we have a lot to teach in a relatively short amount of time,” explains Mike Willett, the lead instructor at the AERO program. It’s one of Honolulu Community College’s most popular offerings, with about 75 current students and more than a hundred on a growing waitlist.

Tran took a sheet-metal course at HCC during the year he waited for a spot to open up. He says he loves everything about aviation, but mechanical training is much cheaper and more accessible than flight school.

The schedule runs for seven hours, four days a week, and leads to an associate of science degree. At the end of the two-year program, the pass rate for first-time test takers seeking FAA certification exceeds the national average, says Willett.

Like the radiologic technology program at KCC, many of the students have outside jobs. Micah Holmberg, who used to repair motorcycles and manufacturing equipment, attends the full-time program, then works as a full-time aircraft mechanic helper nearby. At the end of his double shifts, he travels home to the North Shore.

Hawaiian Airlines regularly opens slots for its part-time paid apprenticeship program for AERO students, and a new scholarship program offers students financial assistance and mentorship. Both were developed to fill openings at Hawaiian caused by retirements. Willett says graduates are also hired by companies such as Hawaii Air Cargo, Swissport and United Airlines, and they leave the program with advanced mechanical skills they can take anywhere.

An apprenticeship changed his life

Drew Maberry works long hours as a journeyman millwright, a job that goes back to classical antiquity when skilled carpenters designed and built water mills. Today, millwrights install, maintain, repair and reassemble machinery used in factories, power plants and construction sites.

On the day we spoke, Maberry had just returned from Par Hawaii, where he was welding large platforms on top of the existing plant in Kapolei. His employer, APB, short for American Piping & Boiler Co., has been contracted by Par to upgrade the facility.

He sets the scene of his jobsite: “I’m wearing fire-resistant clothes and a head sock and gloves. I’m basically covered head to toe, with a hard hat that I change into welding headgear. And I’m two stories high,” welding in the blistering sun of Kapolei.

While the job is strenuous, the pay is good, at $55 an hour, and the benefits are great. With overtime, Maberry’s weekly check is more than he ever imagined he could make when he left high school in Missouri, feeling “lost” and stuck in low-wage retail jobs.

In his mid-20s, Maberry moved to Waimānalo, where his father had relocated. He worked in restaurants for a while, then decided he needed a “career job” so he could live on his own.

After passing math and physical tests, he got a traditional carpentry apprenticeship with the Hawaii Carpenters Apprenticeship & Training Fund, then switched to the union’s millwright apprenticeship when it opened for the first time in 2020.

The past decade has seen a sharp increase in active registered apprenticeships nationwide, from 359,388 in 2015 to over 696,205 in 2025, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. Hawai‘i’s trend line is less robust, with a steep decline in apprenticeships in 2022, though those numbers have inched up in the past couple of years. In 2025, there are 6,094 active apprenticeships in the state, of which about 85% are in construction, 11% in manufacturing and the rest in a smattering of other industries.

Maberry recently completed his apprenticeship’s required 8,000 hours of work and weekly classes, which earned him the official title of journeyman millwright.

Some of his apprenticeship jobs were challenging, he says, including 12-hour days at AES when it was still a coal-fired power plant, with no days off. “I probably have black lung from welding in tight spaces at AES and shoveling dust, or whatever it was,” he says with a laugh.

And he’s worked with plenty of old-school “tough-love” guys, but says that he’s “fortunate that my boss at APB is so understanding and good at dealing with different personalities, which is important because it can be such long hours and grueling work.”

Despite the job’s ups and downs, Maberry says he’s finally financially comfortable and able to provide for his 5-year-old son. And he feels optimistic about the future: “I think about how far I’ve come and I just want to keep learning and building.”

Alternate on-the-job training routes

Beyond Hawai‘i’s dozens of skilled apprenticeships (see the list at tinyurl.com/hiapprentice) spanning from bricklayers to elevator constructors, some large private companies offer their own paid training programs.

Hawaiian Electric’s apprenticeship program, for example, trains people to be linemen, electricians, maintenance mechanics, and maintenance or substation electricians. The program pairs apprentices with experienced journeymen, and supplements on-the-job training with classroom or online instruction. Apprentices are hired based on written and physical tests.

About 250 employees on O‘ahu and in Maui County have completed the program since 2009, and 22 on Hawai‘i Island since 2017, according to Communications Manager Darren Pai. “Establishing our own training programs allows us to address skilled labor shortages, such as linemen, and maintain high safety standards,” he explains in an email.

The more than century-old Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard apprenticeship is the most popular program at Honolulu Community College; it provides the academic component for an associate of applied science degree upon completion.

Other apprenticeships are more informal. The 29-year-old who repaired my refrigerator says he discovered the trade circuitously. He studied environmental science at the University of Montana, then returned home to Hawai‘i Island and started a landscaping business.

After a few years, he decided to do something “less strenuous and more analytical” and mentored with a seasoned HVAC and appliance repair professional on Hawai‘i Island. Eventually, he branched out on his own in Honolulu, where he says the job is “humbling and stressful sometimes, but the fun is in learning new things and diagnosing problems.”

Reaching the other 50%

While apprenticeships and associate degrees are established routes to good jobs, Hawai‘i’s community colleges also offer short-term vocational training. The programs fill a training gap in the Islands since most private vocational schools only teach massage therapy, according to the state Department of Education’s list of licensed schools. And in June, the two Job Corps training centers on O‘ahu and Maui were terminated by the U.S. Department of Labor, along with 97 others across the country.

Short-term training lets participants sample careers, build foundational skills or upskill into better-paying jobs in a variety of areas. For example:

LCC offers commercial driver courses, as does the Hawaiian Council through its Hawaiian Trades Academy.

KCC recently contracted with the Kahala Hotel & Resort to develop training for employees who want to advance into midlevel leadership roles.

HCC launched a summer program that brings high schoolers to campus to try out three career and technical education options.

The Building Industry Association of Hawai‘i offers free pre-apprenticeship training that covers math, blueprint reading and the fundamentals of the trade.

UH Maui College and Hawaiian Electric created a free training program that can lead to jobs at power-generating stations.

High schools across the Islands have introduced career and technical education that helps students gain real-world skills and work experience.

The UH community colleges’ Good Jobs Hawai‘i initiative helps coordinate and fund many of these programs, using $35 million in federal Covid-recovery grants and private philanthropy. Program Manager Nicolette van der Lee says that grant funding runs out next year, but the state Legislature will continue to fund free, noncredit courses for those seeking careers as commercial drivers, nursing aides, information technologists and other high-demand positions.

The Good Jobs program targets the nearly 50% of residents who forgo college and other formal training.

“We’ve been seeking to connect with them and show that you don’t have to have a job in the hotel industry working as a server, or some other entry-level job that doesn’t have a pathway to a living wage,” says Van der Lee.

Early results are promising

A preliminary study shows that short-term training has a positive impact. Hawai‘i residents who completed Good Jobs training were making, on average, about 12% more six months after completing the program, according to a July 7 blog post on the UH Economic Research Organization’s website.

Among those employed before the program, 38% ended up moving to a different industry, where they saw even higher income gains. The biggest gains were for people switching to the health care industry, which the report says saw “average quarterly wage increases approaching $4,000,” or about $16,000 annually.

Younger participants just entering the workplace found jobs in industries “with stronger wage potential, often linked to their training,” according to the blog post.

Van der Lee says the Good Jobs initiative is part of a thriving workforce development ecosystem in Hawai‘i, spearheaded by the state Workforce Development Council. “We want to change the narrative that says you have to leave Hawai‘i for more education and opportunity,” says Van der Lee. “We’re trying to create the education and training infrastructure here, and also the employment opportunities individuals need to get the good jobs so they can stay.”

A troubled economy

Anna Pacheco, president and CEO at AE Consulting, has spent more than a decade researching education and workforce challenges, and consulting with local organizations. She sees unprecedented opportunities now in trade careers, driven by a wave of retirements.

“It has really put us into a talent crunch,” she says. “We’ve got this huge gap with the more senior folks leaving positions and the younger generation not entering them at the speed we need to fill those gaps. And the problem is becoming more and more profound.”

Like Labby from LCC, she says the predominant message that young people hear is to go to college, get a four-year degree and land a professional job.

“The reality is that our economy relies heavily on those trades positions,” Pacheco says. “I think we’re at an inflection point where we need to get students into those careers because if we don’t, we’re not going to reach our clean energy goals or our housing goals.”

While the prospects are promising for people with practical skills in the trades, the picture for recent four-year college graduates is blurrier. The current hiring slowdown, with new jobs only trickling into the U.S. economy, can hit recent graduates the hardest.

Students who majored in computer science, for instance – once seen as a sure bet, complete with snarky “learn to code” comments to English majors – are now the ones who are often bemoaning their job prospects. Today, 6.1% of recent graduates in computer science and 7.5% of computer engineering majors are unemployed – some of the highest rates of all college majors, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Popular majors such as environmental studies now have higher underemployment rates than art history majors, with 49% working in jobs that don’t require a bachelor’s degree. Even new graduates in journalism have significantly less underemployment, at 36%.

In Hawai‘i, UHERO economists see the state slipping into a mild recession in 2026, the result of federal layoffs and less consumer spending and tourism due to tariffs and inflation. Only construction remains resilient, according to UHERO’s September 2025 forecast.

While higher education is always valuable, and often the pathway to a prosperous, fulfilling life, that path can be long, winding and expensive. Quicker, more direct routes are launching many of Hawai‘i’s young adults into rewarding careers, and with fewer financial risks – a big advantage in uncertain times.",https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.hawaiibusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/11/f/y/hero-hawaiis-young-pragmatists-are-choosing-trades-over-college-and-making-six-figures.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 12:01:30.360489

The Quiet Comeback Of Nuclear Energy Construction While renewables grab headlines, nuclear construction is quietly rising again.
With billions invested and decades of work ahead, new energy construction jobs offer stability, growth, and purpose.","A new kind of construction boom is here — one powered by clean energy. Across continents, solar farms, wind projects, nuclear plants, and energy storage sites are creating millions of jobs. The shift is about rebuilding how the world works, one project at a time.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that over 13.7 million people worked in renewables in 2023. As nations aim for net-zero emissions, that number is climbing fast. Governments and investors are pouring trillions into clean infrastructure. Every solar array, wind farm, and storage facility needs workers — and that means opportunity.

Why Are Renewable Energy Construction Jobs Booming?

Clean energy spending hit record highs in 2024. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates global investment in new energy construction surpassed $3.3 trillion, up 25% in just two years.

That surge has unleashed a flood of hiring across solar, wind, nuclear, and battery projects. For every $1 billion invested in renewables, 7,000–8,000 jobs are created. From electricians and welders to engineers and project managers, demand is outpacing supply.

In the U.S., solar installer jobs are projected to grow 22% by 2030, while wind turbine technicians could see 45% growth — among the fastest in any industry.

Solar Construction: The Fastest-Growing Field in Clean Energy

No sector is expanding faster than solar farm construction. These massive installations employ thousands — electricians, civil engineers, heavy equipment operators, and project supervisors — all working together to turn sunlight into power.

Over 5.8 million people now work in solar energy worldwide, according to IRENA. Nearly half are directly involved in building or maintaining solar plants. And with new projects breaking ground every week, job security in this field is strong.

Falling panel prices and government incentives are driving solar’s rise. The U.S. alone added over 35 GW of solar capacity in 2024, creating tens of thousands of new positions. In the Middle East and North Africa, countries like Saudi Arabia and Morocco are building record-breaking solar farms as part of national diversification plans.

A solar project can take years to build and decades to maintain. That means long-term, well-paid careers in a growing industry.

Skills That Power Solar Careers

Modern solar construction blends technology and craftsmanship. Top skills include:

Electrical & Mechanical Work: Wiring, inverters, and energy control systems.

Civil & Structural Engineering: Designing stable racking and foundation systems.

Project Management: Coordinating hundreds of workers and materials.

Digital Monitoring: Managing data through smart sensors and automation tools.

In the U.S., solar construction workers earn $22–$45 per hour, while engineers and managers can make $80,000–$130,000 annually.

The Quiet Comeback Of Nuclear Energy Construction

While renewables grab headlines, nuclear construction is quietly rising again. New-generation designs — Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) — are faster to build, safer to operate, and key to reliable zero-carbon power.

Over 70 new reactors are under construction worldwide. Major projects include Hinkley Point C in the UK and Vogtle Units 3 & 4 in the U.S. Each employs thousands of engineers, technicians, and welders.

Nuclear construction careers demand precision and training. Common roles include:

Civil and structural engineers

Mechanical and welding technicians

Instrumentation and control specialists

Quality assurance and safety inspectors

These roles pay among the highest in the energy sector — often $100,000 to $150,000+ annually.

Battery Storage Projects: The Backbone of Renewable Power

Every solar or wind project needs storage to balance supply and demand. That’s where battery energy storage construction comes in.

Global investment in storage projects topped $40 billion in 2024, and capacity is set to triple by 2030. Each site employs hundreds of skilled tradespeople — electricians, data technicians, and systems engineers — who install and maintain large-scale lithium-ion systems.

Major initiatives like Tesla’s Megapack projects in California and Australia, or Europe’s Grid Booster systems, are hiring rapidly.

Typical roles include:

Battery System Technicians

Thermal Management Engineers

Data Integration Specialists

Pay is strong — often $80,000–$120,000 or more for experienced professionals.

Wind Power and Hybrid Sites: Clean Energy’s Dynamic Duo

Wind energy remains a cornerstone of the renewable boom. Together, wind and solar construction careers form the largest share of global clean energy jobs.

A growing trend is hybrid sites, where wind and solar share infrastructure and connect to battery storage. These projects keep power flowing day and night and demand cross-trained workers.

In this field, flexibility is gold. Electricians, crane operators, site supervisors, and data engineers who understand both technologies are in especially high demand.

The Leading Companies Behind the Clean Energy Boom

Leading construction giants are shifting toward renewables.

Bechtel is spearheading nuclear and wind projects.

Fluor is expanding into hydrogen and solar infrastructure.

Black & Veatch and Siemens Energy are building next-gen storage systems and renewable networks worldwide.

These firms are where innovation meets opportunity, employing millions and training the next generation of clean energy professionals.

Conclusion

The clean energy transition is more than a movement — it’s a rebuild of global industry. From solar farms to nuclear reactors and battery systems, construction workers are shaping a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable world.

With billions invested and decades of work ahead, new energy construction jobs offer stability, growth, and purpose.

Gemini 3 represents a significant boost in performance, beating OpenAI’s top models in several key industry benchmarks, as AI companies regularly leapfrog each other in performance.","Investments in clean energy and transportation hit $75 billion in the US in the third quarter of this year, driven largely by a surge in EV purchases, a new report by Rhodium Group found.

EV sales jumped 32% from the previous quarter to hit a new record as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired at the end of September. But such investment levels are unlikely to continue.

Other clean tech sectors appear to have already peaked: Investments in EV manufacturing, for example, dropped 30% compared to the same period last year. And while companies announced $6 billion in new projects this past quarter, mostly for EVs and batteries, they also cancelled $2 billion worth of existing projects, primarily in battery manufacturing, Rhodium found.

Ukraine is seeking $44 billion in compensation from Russia for war-related carbon emissions. Kyiv said the claim would cover emissions from the fossil fuels and emissions-heavy commodities like cement and steel used in fighting the war, as well as emissions from forest fires and from the deviation of commercial flights around closed Ukrainian airspace. In total, according to one independent analysis, those emissions add up to at least 237 million metric tons, more than the annual emissions of Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia combined.

It’s not clear whether Ukraine’s US and European allies will support the idea of taking this money out of frozen Russian assets, or whether another avenue exists by which Moscow could be compelled to pay. In the meantime, Oxford University researchers argue in a new paper that carbon markets could help Ukraine finance its post-war reconstruction, but only if the country’s emissions regulations are improved.

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva arrived in Belém to rally COP30 delegates toward consensus, as the summit approaches its final days with no resolution on key issues. A call for countries to strengthen their national climate plans has met resistance from some developing countries, who, in a classic catch-22 of climate politics, say they can’t do more without more financial aid from wealthy countries, which are reluctant to commit more aid without stronger plans from recipients. Meanwhile, more than 80 countries have now come out in support of creating a detailed plan to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels.

But the plan still faces opposition from China and Gulf oil producers, among others. Delegates are also caught up in debate over gender identity, with the Vatican, Iran, and others pushing for a narrower definition in a draft Gender Action Plan, which aims to articulate ways in which countries can address the disproportionate impacts of climate change on women and girls. So far the only thing delegates have been able to agree on is where to host upcoming COPs: In Turkey next year, with Australia serving as the chief mediator, and then likely Ethiopia in 2027.

View / COP is ‘drowning in stupid homework’

Climate and energy editor, Semafor

Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez is on a mission at COP30 to save the trees — specifically the untold numbers that are sacrificed for the production of UN reports that no one reads.

Gómez, Panama’s climate envoy, usually spends COP meetings focused on finance and other common priorities. But this year, he told me, he is going into every meeting fixated on slashing paperwork. “People talk about drowning because of sea level rise, but no one is talking about bureaucrats drowning in stupid homework,” he said. Between COP and the multiple other environment-related UN conventions that Panama is a party to, he said, his office is responsible for producing up to 10 reports every year, some stretching to hundreds of pages. And as a remarkably self-aware UN report in August made clear, nearly all of these reports are ignored even by the officials they ostensibly exist to inform.

All this paperwork is more than just an annoyance, he said: For small countries especially, the workload is an unsustainable drain on time and money, and the fragmentation of information across so many channels makes it extremely complicated to make progress on any of the world’s climate goals. The only people who benefit from this system, he said, are the Western consulting firms cashing checks to help. Panama’s solution is to consolidate all of its environment-related plans and status updates into one Nature Pledge, to be published this week, which Gómez said he hopes can be a model for other overwhelmed countries to follow. So if you see Gómez in the hallway in Belém — look for his signature broad-brimmed hat — just don’t ask him to put anything in writing.

I’m back home now after a fun week in Brazil (I highly recommend beers at De Bubuia), but still following COP until it wraps up later this week. On the second day of the conference, Brazilian officials promised it would run no more than “five, maybe 10 minutes” over schedule. If the past is any indication, that’s likely over-optimistic. Most of the key issues up for debate remain unresolved, but as more high-level ministers land in Belém this week, things can start to move quickly.

The Trump administration is pushing through a new series of oil and gas deals, leaning again on US energy exports as a key lever in broader trade negotiations.

As Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House this week, Saudi Aramco is expected to sign two deals to import US liquefied natural gas. Trump and MBS are also expected to discuss a possible deal to advance Saudi Arabia’s nuclear power program.

Meanwhile, the US also agreed to increase exports of liquefied petroleum gas to India, and to sell more LNG to Ukraine, which is facing a deep gas deficit following Russian attacks on its pipelines and gas wells.

While these deals offer a compelling route for Washington to strengthen its hold on global energy markets, they risk overselling what the US can actually provide: Fulfilling the US trade deal with the European Union this year would already require the US to redirect almost all of its existing fossil fuel exports there.

And it’s not clear that global demand for US LNG will really match the administration’s expectations: Goldman Sachs analysts warned in a note today that LNG prices will face a significant drop later this decade as supply overwhelms demand — but could perk back up in the 2030s, depending on how quickly China works to displace coal in its power sector.

Developed countries met their $100 billion climate finance target for developing nations in 2023, but some countries’ overperformance, combined with a focus on quantity rather than quality of funds mobilized, concealed others’ inefficiency, a new report found.

To pinpoint exactly where countries fell short on their commitments, the ODI think tank calculated each nation’s fair share based on historical responsibility for cumulative emissions, GDP, and population. The US, for example, paid less than half its fair share in 2023 despite bearing responsibility for the largest portion of climate finance. By contrast, Norway, France, Sweden, and Japan provided more than twice what they would be expected to deliver.

But even those figures need nuancing: France, while appearing generous in its contributions, stands out for its reliance on loans, while Japan, another generous contributor, allocated less than 15% of its climate finance to adaptation, focusing mostly on lower-emission projects rather than climate-resilient developments.

The Russian oil and gas company Lukoil was suspended from a coalition of oil majors working together to reduce their methane emissions after coming under heightened US sanctions.

The Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter was launched at COP28 in Dubai, and includes 55 companies including all of the big US and European producers. That group is on track to cut its operational methane emissions nearly to zero by 2030, and to reach operational net zero for all emissions by 2050, Bjørn Otto Sverdrup, head of the charter’s secretariat, told Semafor. But for state-owned companies in emerging economies, as well as companies in sanctioned countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, “many of them haven’t really started the journey” on methane, he said, leaving a major gap in the fossil fuel industry’s climate efforts. Lukoil was a rare exception, but “sanctions are making it difficult for companies to engage,” Sverdrup said. In the meantime, the US Treasury Department on Friday cleared the way for some potential buyers to negotiate with Lukoil on acquiring its overseas assets.

The World

at a Glance

US President Donald Trump reportedly approved covert CIA plans inside Venezuela that could pave the way for a broader military campaign in the country.

While the White House says its focus is on halting drug trafficking, experts believe its real aim is to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who reportedly agreed to stand down after a delay of two or three years, an offer rejected by the White House.

Washington’s campaign, which includes the deployment of the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, has triggered a rally in defaulted Venezuelan bonds, reflecting investors’ enthusiasm for a country with enormous economic promise: According to Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate María Corina Machado, the economic benefits of a transition could be worth $2 trillion.

India is racing to stockpile Russian oil before US sanctions on Moscow’s biggest oil firms take effect tomorrow.

New Delhi has been buying Russian crude at steep discounts since the Kremlin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, taking advantage of reduced demand thanks to EU restrictions, and Moscow’s desperation for foreign currency.

But the intake has caused friction between Delhi and Washington, and in August US President Donald Trump imposed punishing 50% tariffs on India. That did little to reduce India’s purchases, but a more recent approach, penalizing companies that bought from Russian oil majors, was more effective: India’s oil refiners are expected to fall in line, although a Carnegie Politika analysis noted that they could “resume purchases when Trump’s attention wanders.”

China is reportedly considering a new stimulus package for its struggling real estate sector, a mammoth industry that if weakened further could threaten the country’s financial stability.

Officials in Beijing are for the first time considering options such as mortgage subsidies and lowering home transaction costs to reverse the sector’s years-long slump.

While Chinese investors have gradually reduced their exposure to real estate, a huge share of the country’s wealth remains tied up in property that is fast losing value.

Despite Beijing’s intervention, “the real estate market downturn will continue for some time,” a former Chinese finance minister said, calling on authorities to keep fiscal policy loose to defend the world’s second-biggest economy from a property crash, Caixin reported.

Some US economic data was permanently lost during the government shutdown, an information shortfall that will make economic policymaking much harder.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the October jobs report would not be released independently, because surveys were halted: It is the first time in 77 years that the government will not publish an unemployment rate. Price data may also be lost.

The lack of information comes with the Federal Reserve divided over whether to cut rates in December, a crucial decision given rising consumer worries about inflation.

Last month, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell preached caution: “What do you do if you’re driving in a fog?” he said. “You slow down.”

The US and Saudi Arabia agreed to develop a rare earths refinery in the Gulf kingdom, the latest in a slew of investments announced after days of meetings between their leaders.

Under the deal, an American minerals firm will partner with Riyadh’s state-owned mining company to supply both countries’ manufacturing and defense industries, which currently rely heavily on rare earths from China, the industry’s dominant player.

While Western nations are racing to diversify their supply, experts have warned that production sites could take years to come online, with a senior official in Greenland — which the US has targeted for its vast deposits — saying it could be a decade before production starts.

The Trump administration is pressing Kyiv to accept a new plan that was drafted in consultation with Russia to end the Ukraine war.

Axios reported that the White House has been secretly working on the proposal with Russian officials, including Kirill Dmitriev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, according to the Financial Times. The framework appears heavily tilted in Moscow’s favor, with one source telling the FT that accepting it would amount to Ukraine giving up its sovereignty; other potential concessions include rolling back US military assistance and adopting Russian as an official state language.

Washington is “trying to will into existence Russia’s maximalist demands,” a Russia-focused journalist argued, by “seizing on Russian battlefield gains and Ukraine’s corruption crisis.”

US chip giant Nvidia reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations on Wednesday, likely reinvigorating the AI trade after several rocky days.

As fears of an AI bubble grow, investors and policymakers are increasingly hungry for clarity on the AI industry’s future; the health of the world’s most valuable company — Nvidia reported a 62% annual increase in quarterly revenue — is critical to that equation by showing bumper demand for its powerful AI chips.

The earnings come a day before September’s delayed US jobs report, another critical signal on the economy’s health that will provide clues into whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.

China is ramping up retaliation against Japan in a diplomatic row that is already impacting Tokyo’s fragile economy.

Beijing said Wednesday it was halting Japanese seafood imports and movie releases, after advising citizens against traveling to Japan. Relations between the two countries soured after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comments about Taiwan; Beijing is now punishing Tokyo with aggressive rhetoric and economic pain.

A blow to tourism is an “unwelcome drag” on Japan, a Moody’s analyst said, after the country reported its first quarterly GDP contraction in more than a year. But Japan’s public is “numb to Chinese rhetoric,” Bloomberg’s Japan-based columnist wrote, and Beijing’s conduct could help Takaichi advance her agenda by galvanizing public support.

The EU is scaling back its attack on Big Tech after years of aggressive regulation.

The bloc’s leadership laid out a “digital package of simplification” on Wednesday, which will streamline rules on AI and privacy — and potentially, dare we hope, remove those “cookies?” pop-up boxes that clutter up the screen before you click them away. The EU has grown concerned that overzealous regulation is stifling growth, The New York Times reported: The European Central Bank’s former President Mario Draghi warned in an influential report last year that without sweeping changes, the bloc could become an economic backwater.

The proposals have sparked backlash in Brussels, The Verge noted, with critics accusing lawmakers of “bowing to pressure from Big Tech.”

The price of bitcoin fell below $90,000 on Wednesday, marking a 27% plunge from its October high and erasing the digital token’s gains for the year.

Investors this week withdrew a record $523 million from BlackRock’s flagship bitcoin ETF, and the stock of pioneering digital asset firm Strategy tumbled further than bitcoin itself did over the same period, raising concerns of a “crypto winter.” The slide could imperil a slew of planned digital currency IPOs that aimed to capitalize on the higher valuations and favorable regulatory environment fostered by US President Donald Trump, The Information noted.

“Investors have never had more ways to place complex wagers on crypto,” The Wall Street Journal wrote, and “the dangers of those bets are becoming apparent.”

Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer became the world’s most valuable work of modern art at auction. Its $236.4 million price also made it the second most expensive artwork auctioned overall.

The portrait by the Austrian pioneer of symbolism and art nouveau was painted between 1914 and 1916, and depicted a young Jewish Viennese society woman; it was confiscated by the Nazis after the Austrian Anschluss. The record price is a rare bright spot for the high-end art market, which is struggling with lack of demand and few big-ticket lots, ARTnews reported.

Another stroke of luck for Sotheby’s: Frida Kahlo’s El sueño (La cama) is expected to set a new record Thursday for the most expensive artwork made by a woman.

A US judge ruled that Meta, the owner of Facebook, does not have an illegal monopoly, a decision that could pave the way for a new era of tech mergers and acquisitions.

The US Federal Trade Commission sued the company in 2020, saying its purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram in the early 2010s unfairly stifled competition. It was part of a wider crackdown on perceived antitrust violations under the Biden-era FTC, under which even small acquisitions were closely scrutinized.

The New York Times called the ruling a “sweeping victory” both for Meta and for Silicon Valley, which relies on big companies buying small ones to fuel innovation, but which has seen such deals cool under the more hawkish regulation.

A group of Africa experts said the upcoming G20 meeting in Johannesburg should focus on debt refinancing for low-income countries hit by soaring debt payments.

The panel said developing nations needed immediate debt relief, with interest payments ballooning in recent years amid rising inflation. While developing countries’ debt remains moderate compared to wealthier nations, their government revenues are far smaller and their interest rates far higher, meaning they spend a huge share of their national income servicing debt. Unless these burdens are eased, Africa will never exploit its potential, a former Ethiopian prime minister said.

This G20 “will long be remembered for its determination — or for its failure — to rise to the challenge,” Hailemariam Desalegn Boshe wrote.

Fitful US efforts to end the Ukraine war appeared to gain renewed momentum, though questions persisted over Russia’s willingness to countenance peace.

A top US envoy is set to meet Ukraine’s president in Turkey in a bid to revive stalled talks between Kyiv and Moscow, and Axios reported that the Trump administration has been secretly working with the Kremlin on a new peace plan.

American officials hope additional sanctions on Russia’s energy sector will bring the country to the table. But Russian President Vladimir Putin showed little interest in compromise during a meeting with China’s premier, and overnight strikes on Ukraine killed nine people, while Romania said it scrambled fighter jets over a purported Russian drone incursion.

The US inked a raft of deals with Saudi Arabia following talks between the countries’ leaders, deepening a partnership at the core of a revamped Middle East security order.

The agreements included the sale of F-35s, a civil nuclear deal, and cooperation on AI technology and critical minerals. Washington also designated Saudi Arabia a major non-NATO ally, while Riyadh pledged to invest $1 trillion in the US.

The visit was not without controversy: President Donald Trump contradicted his own intelligence agencies in saying the Saudi crown prince had no knowledge of the 2018 killing of a Saudi journalist, a murder that once threatened a rupture in bilateral ties. Instead, Congress has largely mimicked the president’s embrace of Saudi.

A successful push to expand uptake of the HPV vaccine will prevent an estimated 1.4 million deaths from cervical cancer, marking a major milestone for global health.

Around 86 million girls in high-risk countries were inoculated, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance announced, as part of a three-year campaign to ramp up access especially in low-income nations: Clinicians rode camels to vaccinate remote herding communities, and traveled by boat to villages that sit on riverbanks, Gavi’s HPV program head told the BBC’s Global News podcast.

But Gavi’s work is threatened by the $3 billion shortfall left by US aid cuts — a deficit that will necessitate “difficult decisions,” a spokesperson told CNN.

Anthropic’s valuation rose to $350 billion Tuesday, after Microsoft and Nvidia announced investments in the AI startup, the latest agreement tying together prominent American tech players.

Anthropic, which makes popular chatbot Claude, in turn made a $30 billion commitment to use Microsoft’s cloud services, as the tech giant tries to reduce reliance on OpenAI. Such eight-figure AI deals are becoming both increasingly common — “These announcements don’t hit like they used to huh,” Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal quipped — as well as circular: Companies are essentially funding their own customers, raising fears of a bubble.

A Goldman Sachs strategist questioned on a recent podcast whether this is “all ultimately a house of cards, with everyone propping each other up.”

China’s public is much more trusting of AI than the Western world, a new Edelman survey showed, a divide that could be critical in the fight for technological domination.

In China, 54% of people said they embrace greater AI use, compared to just 17% in the US; Chinese respondents were also more likely to believe AI can rectify climate change, mental health, and poverty. The enthusiasm reflects how the tech has become entrenched in Chinese life — starting from childhood — and could give Beijing an edge as it challenges the US’ lead.

Silicon Valley startups are increasingly running on lower-cost Chinese AI models, which “seemingly come out of nowhere to close the performance gap” with their US counterparts, a Bloomberg columnist wrote.

The US plans to sell advanced F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, one of several deals expected to emerge from today’s talks between their leaders.

While US President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Oval Office meeting may result in the defense sale — and potentially a civil nuclear deal — bigger issues are still in flux.

With the Middle East security order changing fast, Riyadh is pushing for a US security guarantee and is publicly pivoting away from Beijing in order to deepen ties with Washington. Separately, as Semafor’s Gulf Editor notes in an upcoming column, an obsolete narrative of bottomless Saudi oil wealth is butting up against the reality that Riyadh, like Washington, is courting foreign investment.

An outage at a major software company brought down large parts of the internet on Tuesday.

Cloudflare offers cybersecurity and internet infrastructure services, including encryption, defense against cyberattacks, and other services, for about a fifth of all websites. Its collapse — for an as-yet unknown reason — hit social media platform X and the AI chatbots Claude and ChatGPT, among dozens of other websites.

The problem again reveals the internet’s vulnerability to single points of failure: An outage at Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider, disrupted banks, airlines, and other platforms in October.

Microsoft and Alphabet’s respective cloud services also had significant recent collapses that caused widespread outages.

A few major companies are “the infrastructure of the internet,” an expert told The Guardian, “so when one of them fails it becomes really obvious.”

An intensifying selloff hit global markets yesterday, with stocks, crypto, and even gold dropping sharply.

The rout, partly fueled by investors’ worries of a US equities bubble, led to the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s worst three-day stretch in months, with tech stocks particularly hit: Nvidia, the world’s most valuable firm, lost almost $100 billion from its market capitalization.

Analysts have for months warned of an over-concentration of capital on the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech firms, with some questioning whether the companies will be able to generate the extraordinary revenues needed to justify their soaring valuations.

Meanwhile abroad, experts warn of a deepening global exposure to American stock markets, with foreign investors owning a record share of US equities.

Google is making the latest bid at meeting rising consumer expectations for the capacity of a new AI model with the third version of Gemini released Tuesday.

Gemini 3 represents a significant boost in performance, beating OpenAI’s top models in several key industry benchmarks, as AI companies regularly leapfrog each other in performance. And it hints at what may become Google’s edge in the race between frontier models: its natively multimodal design.

Consumer expectations have been high, with some people speculating on the model’s performance or claiming to have been blown away by previews of its capability. The chatter prompted Andrej Karpathy, a former OpenAI researcher who once led AI for Tesla, to joke “I heard Gemini 3 answers questions before you ask them. And that it can talk to your cat.”

Excitement about a new model release can be positive, but it can also lead to a letdown if consumers expect too much. Some users believed OpenAI’s GPT-5, released in August, would be a major breakthrough and were disappointed when the improvement turned out to be incremental.

The nature of large foundation models like Gemini is that it’s difficult to predict what new capabilities will emerge with a massive new training run, or what attributes might change, irking passionate users who have grown accustomed to them.

“We invest in a lot of testing, both internally and externally,” said Koray Kavukcuoglu, Google’s chief AI architect and CTO of DeepMind, in an interview with Semafor. “But at the end of the day, there’s nothing that can replace hundreds of millions of users testing something in many different ways, and that creativity.”

In this article:

Putting products into the world at such a rapid pace is part of Google’s push to get back to its roots and rise to the challenge of a disruptive new technology wave — one that it helped usher in with AI breakthroughs over the past decade.

In April, DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis put Josh Woodward in charge of the Gemini app to help boost its feature set to appeal to a wider array of consumers. Woodward’s Google Labs, a division he still leads, had built NotebookLM, an experiment that became one of the company’s most popular AI apps.

Google said Tuesday that the app now has 650 million monthly users, putting it closer but still behind ChatGPT’s reported 800 million weekly active users.

Gemini 3 comes with a new batch of products including a developer tool that removes the need for writing code, an agent that can sort your emails, and a vibe coding tool for turning simple prompts into elaborate, interactive graphics.

“That’s all coming from how close we are working together and how synchronized we are that by the time the model development is done, we are actually ready to release something together,” Kavukcuoglu said.

“I’ve been describing the new role as fast and full on,” Woodward said. “There’s a lot of brainstorming, a lot of thinking about where we want to go, what we’re seeing from feedback, but also what are just new model capabilities we can build features around.”

When Google was racing to build what would eventually become Gemini following the surprising success of ChatGPT, it chose to build it as a “natively multimodal” foundation model, incorporating not just text but images, videos, and other multimedia in the training data.

In the long run, DeepMind hopes the approach will lead toward advanced general intelligence and robotics, but it has also borne fruit in the short term, putting the company ahead in areas like image and video creation.

In the latest update, Woodward said the multimodality has shown signs of a kind of cross-pollination, where two modalities improve the capabilities of one another. An example in Gemini 3 is “multimodal vibe coding,” where users can visually instruct the model to make changes in coding. Google product managers, he said, can take screenshots of an application, upload it to the model, and code up new features and bug fixes to show the development team on the spot.

While that was possible in Gemini 2.5, it’s gotten better in the latest version as a result of the two modalities improving in tandem. “They’re not only better individually, but they’re better together,” Woodward said.

Another example is Generative Interfaces, a new feature Google unveiled Tuesday. A user might ask for a visual aid to help learn about a complex subject, like cellular biology. Rather than spit out text or still images, Gemini 3 is capable of coding an app in the background and then presenting it as an interactive experience with animations. “You can imagine that permeating a lot of different tools over time,” Woodward said.

Gemini 3 is an impressive model, judging by the benchmarks, but that’s not surprising. The DeepMind team, combined with Google’s infrastructure, will keep Google at the forefront, if not in the lead, in raw capability. But most of Google’s billions of users probably aren’t aware the benchmarks exist. They notice the products.

Google’s biggest challenge — the one it’s been tackling now for a few years — is turning AI capability into products as transformative and essential as YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and, of course, search itself.

The Gemini 3 launch seems to show the breadth of possibilities. The product announcements span enterprise and consumer, productivity and entertainment. It’s a reminder that Google is gargantuan. That is one of its weaknesses. Size moves slowly. But if the company can execute on AI product development across its vast empire, size can also be an advantage.

Generative interfaces, for instance, may be what “search” looks like in the future. While OpenAI and Perplexity have changed search from a bunch of blue links to a coherent answer, that probably isn’t where this ends. Most people are visual learners, so it makes sense they would prefer an interactive, visual app instead of a paragraph of text.

Right now, there isn’t enough compute power to offer this kind of response for free to billions of users. But that part is what Google is really good at — finding ways to build infrastructure as efficiently as possible — or in space, if needed.

Google has a daunting challenge ahead, one that requires a lot of building in every corner of the empire. You can tell that the employees who have remained at the company are having a little bit more fun, even if they’re working more hours.

With each product launch, you catch a glimpse of the progress.

Reuters reported recently that DeepMind’s Hassabis has been focused on the company’s scientific endeavors at the expense of its business.

Some investors question why Alphabet hasn’t emerged as the undisputed AI leader given its inherent strengths. “It’s the classic team with all the talent that doesn’t win the national championship,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. The Minneapolis investment firm this year sold around $14 million of Alphabet stock, concerned about its prospects, despite recent strides, in the fast-changing AI marketplace, Munster said.

Google has quite a bit of catching up to do with other AI companies, especially OpenAI, but the search giant’s bets on cloud, chips, and research may be starting to pay off, Business Insider argues. “If Gemini 3 is a smash hit, Google just has to not fumble it. No pressure,” tech correspondent Hugh Langley writes.

China’s civil aircraft manufacturer COMAC took a crucial first step towards challenging Western planemaking giants Boeing and Airbus.

The company flew its C919 airliner at the Dubai Airshow, in its first unveiling outside of Asia. The narrow-body plane entered service in China in 2023, a rival to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, the workhorses of commercial aviation. So far, though, it has had no major customers outside China and lacks certification by major Western regulators.

Boeing, though, is struggling after some high-profile disasters, and China’s ties to Gulf countries means there is a market opportunity for COMAC. Analysts told Reuters that China would struggle to gain significant market share, but that COMAC’s presence in Dubai was a signal of its ambition.

US President Donald Trump threatened to expand his military campaign to countries across Latin America, rattling local markets and upending geopolitics in the region.

The Trump administration has carried out strikes on vessels off the coast of Venezuela alleged to be ferrying drugs, and the president said yesterday he would be “proud” to extend attacks to include land targets in Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela.

The threats mark a sharp shift in Washington’s foreign policy, suggesting it wants to make the Western Hemisphere — where Chinese presence has surged this century — its central focus, The New York Times’ Mexico bureau chief said. The “Donroe Doctrine… promises major benefits,” including access to natural resources and “strategic security positions,” Jack Nicas wrote.

Poland said an explosion along a railway line used to ferry supplies to Ukraine was an act of “sabotage,” implying that Russia was behind the blast.

The incident, which did not result in casualties, was the latest in a series of episodes across Europe for which authorities have suggested Moscow was responsible. Analysts say the Kremlin uses so-called hybrid warfare to sow discord, test European defences, and blur the line between war and peace. Russia has denied responsibility for the various unexplained drone sightings, explosions, and killings.

Even as they increase traditional defense spending to deter Moscow, however, Europeans “must also acknowledge that hybrid hostilities with the Kremlin are already underway,” an expert wrote for the Atlantic Council.

Gunmen abducted 25 girls from a boarding school in northern Nigeria, the latest sign of the country’s persistent security struggles. The region — which borders the Sahel, the world’s terrorism hotspot — has for years been overrun by Islamist militias including Boko Haram, which in 2014 kidnapped 270 girls in northern Nigeria. Successive governments have vowed to crack down on the armed groups, though progress has been limited.

The US, which has accused Abuja of doing little to stop the killing of Christians in the country, has pushed for greater cooperation; Nigeria’s foreign minister confirmed recent security talks between the countries, AFP reported.

India agreed to source nearly 10% of its liquefied petroleum gas from the US, as New Delhi works to finalize its long-awaited trade deal with Washington.

Monday’s agreement, which an Indian minister called a “historic first,” will bolster India’s energy security and also mollify the US, The Times of India wrote, after Washington slapped New Delhi with punishing tariffs over its trade surplus and purchases of Russian crude.

The deal also helps India diversify its supply of LPG, a key cooking fuel, away from Gulf countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, even as New Delhi increases its Middle East crude oil imports following sanctions on Russia. It reflects “the delicate balance India is trying to achieve,” Bloomberg reported.

Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler kicks off a diplomatic offensive in Washington this week, seeking to cement a deepening alliance with a raft of proposed deals.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is pursuing a defense guarantee, a nuclear agreement, and greater access to cutting-edge chips to fuel the kingdom’s economic diversification and AI ambitions. Once a pariah over the murder of a Saudi journalist, MBS now enjoys strong relations with the US, won over by Saudi’s social transformation, economic potential, and stores of energy needed to power data centers.

But despite closer ties, MBS must still ensure that “all the goodwill he has built up in the Trump era continues into future administrations,” Semafor’s Saudi bureau chief noted.

Japanese tourism and retail stocks fell Monday as the country’s diplomatic spat with China weighed on investors.

Nearly 500,000 Japan-bound plane tickets on Chinese airlines were canceled after Beijing told citizens to avoid traveling there, the South China Morning Post reported. The row stemmed from the new Japanese premier’s comments about Taiwan; Tokyo dispatched a senior official to China on Monday in a bid to ease tensions. This isn’t a “crisis moment,” FXStreet wrote, but rather a “meaningful reset in Asia’s geopolitical risk premium.”

Beijing — which is known to test new, Taiwan-sympathetic leaders — sees a global diplomatic tilt in favor of Taipei and wants to signal that “rhetorical shifts around Taiwan… will be met with economic consequences.”

Jeff Bezos is launching an AI startup that he will spearhead as co-CEO, The New York Times reported.

Called Project Prometheus, the company has secured more than $6 billion in funding and plans to focus on tech that “dovetails with Mr. Bezos’ interest in taking people to outer space,” The Times wrote, with AI assisting in engineering and manufacturing across computers and aerospace. The move marks a return to the C-suite for Bezos, who has not held a formal operational role since stepping down as Amazon CEO in 2021.

Bezos is jumping into a crowded field, where a growing number of buzzy startups are raising billions to research ways to accelerate AI applications in the physical sciences.

A Bangladeshi court sentenced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death over her government’s deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising that ousted her last year.

Hasina, convicted of crimes against humanity, has been in self-exile in India since fleeing Bangladesh more than 14 months ago; Dhaka has called on New Delhi to extradite her, though given her close ties to India, it’s unlikely to do so. The sentence seals Hasina’s downfall — even though she still leads the former ruling party — and could “reshape the country’s political future” ahead of elections scheduled for February, a Bangladeshi journalist wrote.

If the next government aggressively pushes for Hasina’s extradition, it could put more pressure on India and its relationship with Dhaka.","https://img.semafor.com/18e29b3241e38ca12dcb66b63b2ad9f980578df2-5500x3667.jpg?rect=0,390,5500,2888&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-11-20 08:59:07.082564

In October, BAN identified several US-based ITAD companies sending used electronics to countries where import rules restrict or prohibit such material under Basel Convention-aligned regulations.

The United States is not a Basel party, and US law does not explicitly ban all outbound shipments of used electronics. But such exports can violate the receiving countries’ rules, and the findings reinforced concerns about screening processes, downstream vetting and the reliability of voluntary certifications across the sector.

Those issues were widely viewed as challenges concentrated among small or mid-sized operators. A new federal enforcement action announced this week suggests otherwise. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s settlement with Apple over hazardous waste violations at a facility in Santa Clara adds a separate, but related, reminder that gaps in environmental management appear at multiple levels of the electronics value chain. Even some of the best-resourced firms are experiencing basic compliance failures in areas regulators consider foundational.

The EPA’s settlement, published Nov. 18, concludes a two-year review of a facility Apple uses for semiconductor-related research and development. The agency cited deficiencies in waste characterization, emissions controls for solvent systems, container management, land-disposal notifications and routine inspection practices.

Apple has since corrected the issues and agreed to pay a $261,283 penalty. According to the agency, the site is now operating in compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the federal framework governing hazardous waste.

These findings were not new to observers who followed the case during its earlier stages. Inspection records released in 2024, including documents referenced by the individual who filed the initial complaint, outlined the specific handling and characterization issues that drew EPA attention in the first place.

Regulators identified at least 19 potential violations during inspections conducted in August 2023 and January 2024. The issues documented in those reports included solvent tanks managed under state-only classifications despite meeting federal criteria for ignitable waste, incomplete testing of carbon filters used to trap VOC emissions, and several corrosive or solvent waste containers lacking full analysis or required labeling.

Inspectors also found gaps in monitoring routines. Daily inspection logs were incomplete, particularly on weekends when the building operated without personnel on site. Calibration records for emissions-monitoring equipment were missing in several instances, and some waste shipments may not have included documentation demonstrating proper federal characterization. While the EPA press release summarized only the principal violations, the more detailed inspection documents provided the operational description behind the ultimate settlement.

The BAN investigation and the Apple case expose how inconsistent environmental enforcement has become. The two situations differ in scale and context, but they highlight similar structural weaknesses in the form of incomplete downstream controls in the ITAD sector, and uneven operational discipline within R&D environments at major electronics manufacturers. Both areas involve materials, including solvents, corrosives, VOC sources, or end-of-life electronics, that require clear documentation and traceability to maintain environmental compliance.

The Apple situation also illustrates the particular challenges associated with semiconductor research sites. These facilities handle smaller volumes of hazardous materials than large fabrication plants, but the chemical profiles and regulatory expectations are similar. As AI- and ML-driven hardware development accelerates, demand for specialized solvents and process chemicals has increased. Regulators have responded by paying closer attention to emissions routing, waste determinations, and storage timelines, especially in regions like Santa Clara where semiconductor-related activity is dense.

The convergence of these developments carries practical implications for ITAD operators. The BAN findings showed that not all downstream partners are operating within the rules of importing countries or international norms. The Apple settlement showed that even large companies face scrutiny over waste handling fundamentals.

Both outcomes suggest that environmental assurances, whether in an OEM’s sustainability pledge or an ITAD firm’s certification claims, require verification and internal systems strong enough to withstand inspection.

What is certain is that in the broader market, repeated compliance concerns can influence enterprise procurement and ESG assessments. Investors and customers increasingly weigh environmental performance when evaluating supply-chain partners.

Although the financial penalty in Apple’s case is small relative to the company’s scale, the enforcement action signals the continued regulatory attention aimed at hazardous waste handling in the electronics ecosystem.

With the Santa Clara investigation now closed, the EPA has affirmed that Apple has resolved the identified issues. But the broader pattern remains: Environmental compliance challenges are emerging across multiple segments of the electronics chain, from downstream exports to upstream prototyping labs.

As scrutiny intensifies and expectations around traceability expand, operators at all levels, from recyclers and major OEMs to enterprises that use the technology, may face more sustained pressure to tighten oversight and improve documentation.

It’s questionable whether a final rule will be issued by the announced December deadline—at least if the agency goes through established channels. But if and when the GHG standards and findings are upended, the move could open the door for more regulatory rollbacks.

The EPA maintains it has no authority to regulate vehicle emissions under the Clean Air Act, despite an earlier ruling to the contrary. The Clean Air Act argument, if it sticks, sets the stage to potentially undo emissions standards for oil and gas operations and other polluting facilities. This normally requires a series of “individual rule-making” steps, but EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has signaled that he may invoke the ""good cause"" exception under an administrative act to bypass those steps. Some petro stakeholders worry that dismantling the federal law could actually work against them because it could give states more regulatory leeway.

Pat Parenteau, a professor and senior fellow for Climate Policy, Vermont Law and Graduate School, explains: “Today, [oil and gas] companies' main argument against liability is that the Clean Air Act preempts state law. If the Supreme Court reverses its holding and rules that the Act does not authorize regulation of GHG, the preemption argument falls away.

“Companies would be liable in more than 30 lawsuits that states and municipalities have filed [to date] and could be on the hook for billions of dollars in damages from climate change,” he says.

The other focus of this rule-making, the endangerment finding, is the legal foundation for climate policies. It concludes that certain greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.”

It was the EPA that established the finding back in 2009 based on a robust collection of decades of research. More recent studies further back the endangerment finding, “with zero countervailing evidence,” write a group of researchers who say their climate predictions have all come true, “some alarmingly faster than anticipated.”

“The scientific consensus that runaway greenhouse gas emissions are hazardous to human health and well-being is so total, thorough, and overwhelming that it has withstood decades of well-funded attempts to disprove it,” says Jon Goldstein, associate vice president, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund.

But Trump’s EPA stands firm that the agency “unreasonably analyzed the scientific record” and also claims that “no requisite technology for vehicle and engine emission control can address global climate change concerns without risking greater harms to public health and welfare.”

EPA bases its position largely on a new Department of Energy report that downplays the impact of climate change. Though it reportedly contains a plethora of inaccuracies, with several scientists stating that its content misrepresents their conclusions. In line with the push for these regulatory rollbacks, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program that requires coal-fired power plants, industrial factories, and oil refining facilities to disclose their emissions to the federal government. The EPA is also targeting dozens of other air and or water quality protections, loosening and or eliminating standards for fossil energy sectors.

The agency argues that these regulations come with too high a cost to industries, which ultimately gets passed down to taxpayers. Though previous administrations point to the “social costs” of carbon, or the economic damages (such as harm to human health and declining crop yields). EPA concluded in 2023 that one metric ton of carbon dioxide cost $190 in 2020; and projected it would cost about $230 in 2030; and about $308 in 2050.

In the absence of strong, constant federal policy over time, states are increasingly setting their own rules. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have adopted greenhouse gas reduction targets to address climate change, with Colorado’s among the most rigorous. The state passed the first methane rules for the oil and gas sector in 2014 and, in 2024, became the first to create a comprehensive framework for methane measurement, reporting, and verification at oil and gas production sites.

Notably, Colorado’s regulations have come from a collaborative stakeholder-driven process that has earned the support of the state’s oil and gas trade associations, Goldstein says. New Mexico is also among the most aggressive in its clampdown on oil and gas releases, and emissions have been dropping since. Satellite readings of a part of the Permian Basin show that the methane intensity on New Mexico’s side of the basin was less than half of that on neighboring Texas’s loosely regulated side.

Other states and regions join Colorado and New Mexico with varied policies targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or policies to develop clean energy resources or promote alternative fuel vehicles, among other measures. Though the Trump administration is attempting to block states from leading in transitioning to clean energy, having revoked vehicle emissions standards set by California and by over a dozen other states, actions that have prompted lawsuits.

Some of the private sector is continuing to prioritize climate actions too, despite a radically changing federal policy landscape. Ninety-one percent of businesses surveyed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development either maintained or increased their investments in clean energy in 2025. They are investing in climate-proofing their value chains. They have committed to setting science-based targets for emissions reductions. And are buying carbon credits.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/bltcac270dea623eab8/691e52de78e5efa9d3bb2cdc/US_EPA_HQ_1540.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-20 11:05:05.200145

Schneider signs two deals with US data centre operators

New agreements expected to generate nearly $2.3 billion in sales

Company says its solution can scale AI capacity without raising power demand

Nov 19 (Reuters) – Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA) said on Wednesday that it had signed new deals worth almost $2.3 billion with two U.S. data centre operators, as surging adoption of artificial intelligence boosts infrastructure demand.

At an industry event in Las Vegas, the French industrial group announced a $1.9 billion partnership with privately held tech firm Switch, covering power modules and cooling systems.

The second agreement, valued at $373 million and involving uninterruptible power supplies and switchgear, was signed with Texas-based Digital Realty (DLR.N).

The two contracts are a phased delivery of 2025 and 2026, a Schneider spokesperson said.

Schneider, France’s biggest energy company by market value, has emerged as a key data centre supplier, making server racks, cooling and power equipment that form the backbone of AI infrastructure.

It is also working with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) to design cooling systems for its most powerful AI chips.

Large-scale cloud service providers, also known as hyperscalers, are racing to build AI infrastructure. Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft are projected to spend more than $360 billion in 2025, according to company filings.

AI RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON US ENERGY GRID

The deal with Switch is Schneider’s largest cooling services agreement for data centres in North America to date. Schneider said the solution it is supplying should help scale AI capacity without proportionally increasing energy demand.

“Current data centre infrastructure wasn’t built to meet the demands of AI,” said Vandana Singh, senior vice president at Schneider’s North American secure power division.

U.S. utilities are struggling to keep pace with Big Tech’s power-hungry AI data centres.

Analysts from Morgan Stanley have estimated that global power demand from data centres will nearly triple in the next three years, intensifying the strain on already stretched U.S. power grids.

The data centre business accounts for nearly a quarter of Schneider’s total revenue. Financial analysts are expecting it to unveil targets tied to AI development during its capital markets day in London on December 11.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Zack Colman explains the implications of China becoming the dominant force in global climate talks.","Massachusetts is often a climate bellwether for the United States. It spearheaded the country’s first regional cap and trade program, was among the first states to mandate greenhouse gas reductions, and launched the U.S. offshore wind industry with a 2016 law directing its utilities to buy large amounts of power generated by turbines at sea.

So it was notable when Massachusetts Democrats floated a plan this month to water down the state’s 2030 climate targets.

The news provoked a fierce public backlash and quick legislative backtracking. Massachusetts House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz told my colleague Adam Aton that the proposal is now likely dead in the water.

But the mere fact the deep-blue state is publicly debating the subject shows just how much the political landscape has shifted between President Donald Trump’s first term and his second.

During Trump’s first four years in Washington, Massachusetts was at the forefront of a liberal state push to tackle climate. The state forged ahead with its plan to build out offshore wind, pushed for a cap and trade program covering the transportation sector and, shortly after Trump left office, passed a law to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.

Today, Massachusetts’ leaders are not only dealing with the lingering fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sent natural gas prices and utility bills soaring, but also the slow pace of offshore wind development. The state’s first project is nearing completion, almost a decade after it was awarded a power contract. It’s not clear whether any others will follow. The state has repeatedly postponed finalizing contracts for a pair of new projects.

The story unfolding in Massachusetts is hardly unique.

In Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro struck a budget deal with Republican legislative leaders that pulls the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The Democrat framed the move as a way to move forward on other clean energy proposals while addressing voters’ concerns over the cost of living, Adam and Scott Waldman reported earlier this week.

Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, fresh off being named one of the world’s 100 most influential people on climate change by Time Magazine, recently approved a natural gas pipeline in her state.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential candidate who popped up at global climate talks in Brazil last week, has walked back his state’s clean fuel mandates and a plan to cap oil company profits.

As Massachusetts goes, so goes the nation.

COP Corner

It’s a tie: Turkey will host next year’s U.N. climate conference — but Australia will hold the summit’s presidency, write Karl Mathiesen, Zack Colman and Zia Weise.

The two countries faced off for more than a year over the talks’ location. The deal is a highly unusual arrangement for the annual climate conference, which normally has a single host and presidency. But it’s not unprecedented: In 2017, Germany hosted a Fijian-led conference.

Control of the presidency means Australia will run the diplomacy, said Chris Bowen, the country’s minister for climate change and energy.

“Obviously it would be great if Australia could have it all. But we can’t have it all,” Bowen said. “It’s also a significant concession for Turkey.”

A Turkish official, who did not give his name, said the final deal would be announced on Thursday. Turkey had proposed hosting the talks in the Mediterranean city of Antalya.

Rush to adapt: Disaster-battered nations are calling for a U.N. agreement to triple the amount of adaptation funding to $120 billion annually, writes Sara Schonhardt.

The move at COP30 comes as wealthy nations fall short of their previous commitments to boost funding for projects that protect people, property and crops from storms, drought and extreme heat. But time is running short: Experts warn that global warming could soon breach 1.5 degrees Celsius, leading to more lives lost and physical and economic damage that would be increasingly hard to recover from.

But has he tried dancing?: The Brazilian president had some choice words for Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor who disparaged Belém last week. As Nette Nöstlinger writes, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva quipped that Merz “should have gone dancing in Pará,” referring to the state where Belém is located.

“He should have tasted Pará’s cuisine. Because he would have realized that Berlin doesn’t offer him 10 percent of the quality that the state of Pará offers,” Lula said.

Power Centers

Trump’s superlative streak

Trump praised his top energy brass “superstars” and touted “groundbreaking” agreements with Saudi Arabia at today’s U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, write Hannah Northey and Christa Marshall.

Trump applauded Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia for vowing Tuesday to invest up to $1 trillion in the U.S. He also boasted that his administration would quickly approve power plants for data centers.

“In fact, Lee Zeldin, one of the superstars of this administration, I said, ‘Lee, if it’s oil and gas, get them approved in two weeks,” Trump said, referring to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. “If it’s nuclear, add another week, because some are going ‘nuclear,’ and … they better be careful. But they are going to be careful, they’re the greatest people in the world, so now they come back, and they actually believed it, and now they’re being approved rapidly.”

The data center winter threat

The nation’s grid monitor is warning that the data center boom is raising the risk of winter outages, writes Peter Behr.

More than a dozen states are at risk of power shortages under extreme winter conditions, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp. That includes New England, the Carolinas, parts of the Tennessee Valley region, most of Texas, several eastern Rocky Mountain states and the Pacific Northwest.

NERC emphasized that all the regions are expected to have enough power in normal winter conditions. But peak winter demand is skyrocketing in areas with a lot of data centers, increasing the threat of outages for a low-probability, once-in-a-decade threat — though extreme winter storms are becoming more frequent as the climate warms.

Cruise industry gets DOJ assist

The Trump administration is backing the cruise industry’s bid to sink a Hawaiian tax that aims to offset the costs of climate change, writes Lesley Clark.

The Cruise Lines International Association filed suit against Hawaii in August, seeking to block the state’s move to place a surcharge on the gross fare paid by a cruise ship’s passengers. The Department of Justice has filed a motion to intervene in the federal case, calling the state’s “green fee” aimed at cruise ship operators and passengers a “scheme to extort American citizens and businesses.”

DOJ’s move comes as the Trump administration has stepped up efforts to battle state initiatives that aim to hold the fossil fuel industry financially responsible for climate change impacts.

The need for the project has been independently assessed and approved by the National Energy System Operator (NESO) and energy regulator, Ofgem.
Community feedback has played a major role in shaping the Lewis Hub.
With consent now granted, construction of the Lewis Hub is expected to begin early in 2026.
Reflecting the significant expansion of the transmission network across the north of Scotland, SSEN Transmission continues to grow its workforce.","This decision by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar follows more than two years of development and extensive community and stakeholder engagement by SSEN Transmission, which will build the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converter station and AC substation near Stornoway.

The Lewis Hub is a key part of the Western Isles HVDC Connection Project that will establish a high voltage subsea and underground transmission link connecting to the proposed Fanellan substation development near Beauly, enabling 1.8 GW of new renewable electricity generation. It will connect the Western Isles to the GB transmission network for the first time and follows a two decades-long wait for a connection to unlock the vast renewable energy potential of the Western Isles, and the associated benefits that will propel economic growth.

The development forms part of Perth-headquartered SSEN Transmission’s over £22 billion investment to transform the electricity network in the north of Scotland, enabling the homegrown, low-carbon electricity needed to meet clean power and energy security targets. The need for the project has been independently assessed and approved by the National Energy System Operator (NESO) and energy regulator, Ofgem.

Community feedback has played a major role in shaping the Lewis Hub. SSEN Transmission opted not to proceed with its original preferred site at Creed North following input from local residents and landowners, instead selecting the current site at Arnish Moor near Stornoway.

The project will deliver substantial local benefits, including new housing, jobs, and supply chain opportunities, along with £1.06 million in community benefit funding which is the total amount of funding available for the development under the UK Government’s guidance on the delivery of community funds for transmission infrastructure.

Local benefits already being delivered by the Lewis Hub include:

Multi-million-pound funding to unlock the development of nearly 100 new homes near Stornoway, which will initially house construction workers but will pass to the local community and provide a substantial boost for affordable home provision in Lewis.

£3.4 million to upgrade a road leading to Arnish Point near Stornoway, improving access to Stornoway Port and supporting local economic development.

Significant funding to expand Macaulay College, providing new facilities to help students reach their potential.

With consent now granted, construction of the Lewis Hub is expected to begin early in 2026.

Alison Hall, Director of Development for SSEN Transmission, commented: “We are delighted with today’s decision, which will play a major role in supporting Scotland and the UK’s clean energy ambitions, and help fulfil a decades-long ambition to connect the Western Isles to the GB transmission network. Investing in this local electricity transmission network connection is also a major driver of jobs and economic activity, and we are already seeing the positive impact the Lewis Hub is delivering through new housing and infrastructure upgrades supporting economic and social growth for the islands.”

Hall continued: “With the creation of new jobs within SSEN Transmission and our supply chain partners, as well as proposals for community benefit funding and our housing legacy commitments, our projects will deliver a lasting legacy in communities across the north of Scotland including in the Western Isles. This decision marks a key milestone in delivering UK and Scottish Government energy targets – creating a hub for clean energy projects that will help build a cleaner, more secure and affordable electricity system for generations to come.”

Colin Bell, Lead Development Project Manager for SSEN Transmission, noted: “This decision is the culmination of a detailed development process where we have sought to achieve the best balance from a community, environmental, and technical perspective, listening closely to the views of the local community with whom we have consulted extensively. We will continue to engage constructively with the local community throughout the lifetime of this project, as we fulfil our commitment to being a good neighbour and delivering a positive legacy.”

The Lewis Hub is a key part of SSEN Transmission’s plans to invest at least £22 billion in the period until March 2031, potentially rising to £31.7 billion. This represents one of the largest private investment programmes in Scotland and will act as a major driver of jobs and economic growth across the country.

Independent economic analysis, peer-reviewed by leading consultancy, BiGGAR Economics, forecasts that if fully delivered, the £31.7 billion investment could support up to 17 500 jobs in Scotland, including 8400 in the north of Scotland, and add up to £7 billion to the Scottish economy, with £3 billion in the north of Scotland alone.

Reflecting the significant expansion of the transmission network across the north of Scotland, SSEN Transmission continues to grow its workforce. Employee numbers have increased from around 400 in 2019 to over 2500 today, with plans to recruit around 600 new roles in 2025/26.

Following the UK Government’s Community Benefit Guidance for new electricity transmission infrastructure, over £100 millions of community benefit funding is expected across the north of Scotland.

SSEN Transmission’s Pathway to 2030 programme is also expected to support the development of at least 1000 new homes across the north of Scotland, creating a lasting legacy by meeting local housing needs once projects are complete. The recent announcement of an agreement enabling the construction of close to 100 new homes near Stornoway was among the first deals to be reached by SSEN Transmission as part of its housing strategy ambitions.

As part of the Trump administration's push to bolster domestic supplies of minerals critical to American automotive, defense, energy, and high-tech manufacturing, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (Permitting Council) has added the Nickolai in Alaska and Sheep Creek in Montana as transparency projects on the Federal Permitting Dashboard.

""I am excited to welcome the Nikolai Nickel and Sheep Creek projects to the FAST-41 program,"" said Permitting Council Executive Director Emily Domenech. ""We are proud to support more mining projects that will strengthen the U.S. economy and reduce our reliance on foreign nations.""

Established in 2015 by Title 41 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41), the Permitting Council is a federal agency charged with improving the transparency and predictability of permitting critical infrastructure projects – including mines, natural gas pipelines, renewable energy, electricity transmission, telecommunications, and certain emerging technologies.

Under the Trump administration, the Permitting Council has steadily added to the list of mining projects eligible for the streamlined permitting and transparency offered by the FAST-41 program.

Graphite Creek and Donlin Gold are among the high-profile projects in Alaska that have been added to the FAST-41 program. The Stillwater palladium-platinum mine is a top Montana project accepted into the program.

FAST-41 projects fall into two categories:

• Covered projects, which receive coordinated interagency permitting and defined timelines, and a public dashboard that offers transparency and accountability.

• Transparency projects, typically smaller or earlier-staged projects, which benefit from public-facing permitting dashboards but do not receive full coordination.

Both Nickolai and Sheep Creek have been added as transparency projects at this stage.

""I look forward to working with the project sponsors to provide a transparent and predictable federal permitting process while achieving President Trump's vision for American energy dominance,"" said Domenech.

Enormous Alaska nickel project

Lying on the southern flanks of the Alaska Range, approximately 130 miles southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska Energy Metals' Nikolai project hosts one of the largest known nickel-cobalt-platinum group metal (PGM)-chromium deposits in North America.

Based on drilling completed by Alaska Energy Metals and previous exploration companies, the Eureka deposit at Nikolai hosts:

• 1.19 billion metric tons of indicated resource averaging 0.21% (5.61 billion pounds) nickel.

• 2.09 billion metric tons of inferred resource averaging 0.2% (9.38 billion lb) nickel.

• Large quantities of copper, cobalt, PGMs, chromium, and iron byproducts are found in both resource categories.

The chromium, cobalt, copper, nickel, palladium, and platinum found in this world-class-sized deposit are all on the 2025 list of minerals critical to U.S. economic development, energy, and national security.

""With Nikolai hosting six critical minerals, two of which, nickel and cobalt, are Defense Production Act Title III materials deemed to be in shortfall, we are extremely well aligned with the U.S. national security objective of developing long-lived, domestic sources of metals and minerals essential to the national economy and national defense,"" said Alaska Energy Metals CEO Gregory Beischer.

In addition to advancing Nickolai towards mine design, permitting, and development, Alaska Energy Metals has partnered with RecycLiCo Battery Materials to study the potential of leveraging RecycLiCo's proprietary hydrometallurgical process to refine critical mineral concentrates produced at Nikolai.

""AEMC would like to produce refined metal products from our Nikolai deposit on-site rather than having to ship metal concentrate to Asian smelters for refining – particularly at a time when the United States is heavily reliant on countries officially designated Foreign Entities of Concern to meet U.S. demand for nickel and other critical minerals,"" said Beischer.

With Nikolai added as a FAST-41 transparency project, federal agencies, investors, and the public at large will be able to track permitting activities as Alaska Energy Metals advances its plans to develop a multi-critical-mineral mine and refining complex in Alaska.

Extraordinary Sheep Creek

While in an even earlier stage of exploration and development, US Critical Materials' Sheep Creek project in southwestern Montana is extraordinary in both the quantities and grades of several high-priority critical minerals found there.

Sheep Creek is best known for hosting high-grade gallium and rare earths, and also hosts significant quantities of niobium – a metal essential to advanced steel alloys and classified as critical to the U.S.

High-grade critical mineral values at Sheep Creek were confirmed by Idaho National Laboratories in 2024. Highlights from nine rock samples collected over a two-mile-long mineralized corridor at Sheep Creek include:

• 13.45% total rare earth elements (TREE) and 250 parts per million gallium.

• 13.82% TREE and 300 ppm gallium.

• 17.78% TREE and 350 ppm gallium.

On average, the samples returned 9.9% TREE, including 2.4% neodymium and praseodymium – the key rare earths used in high-power magnets for EV motors, defense systems, and other high-tech devices.

The gallium found at Sheep Creek is a high-priority metal for the U.S.

""Gallium is not just a mineral – it's a strategic asset,"" said GreenMet CEO Drew Horn, a defense supply chain strategist who previously served as a senior official at the White House National Security Council, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense.

Four interrelated factors make gallium a strategic asset to the U.S.:

• It is extremely rare and seldom found in concentrations high enough to support a standalone mine.

• It is the primary ingredient in wide-bandgap semiconductors used in smartphones, computers, telecommunication networks, LEDs, solar cells, and medical devices.

• The U.S. is 100% reliant on imports for its supply of this high-tech metal.

• China, which produces roughly 98% of the global supply, banned exports of gallium to the U.S. in 2024.

Sheep Creek is one of the only places in the world that shows potential to support a standalone gallium mine that would also produce significant rare earth and niobium co-products.

Sheep Creek's addition as a FAST-41 transparency project signals increased federal attention as US Critical Materials gains a better understanding of the quantities of critical minerals found there and looks at future-leaning technologies to extract them efficiently and sustainably.

""We look forward to partnering with the Permitting Council and the Forest Service to advance Sheep Creek exploration and support the national priority to reestablish U.S. mineral sovereignty,"" said Eric Levy-Myers, director of strategy and innovation at US Critical Materials. ""We are particularly committed to implement next-generation, environmentally responsible Mine of the Future techniques.""

(Reuters) -Operators of the U.S. electric grid covering the world's largest data center market on Wednesday said they planned to move forward with a plan to manage the connection of the giant server warehouses that are propelling the country's power use to record highs and raising the risk of supply shortfalls.

PJM Interconnection, the biggest grid operator in North America, spanning 13 states and Washington, D.C., has been struggling to keep up with booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centers needed for the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.

PJM members, which include power generators, utilities and large energy users, cast votes on Wednesday that rejected about a dozen proposals aimed at quickly linking up data centers to the PJM grid while attempting to reduce the reliability risks of doing so. Following the results, representatives of the PJM Board of Managers said they still intended to advance a plan to handle its surging data center interconnection requests and aimed to finalize it by December.

Earlier proposals for the so-called ""Critical Issue Fast Path"" required data center developers to bring their own power supplies and shut off operations during energy emergencies, including when electricity use surges on very hot and cold days. Those provisions were removed from later versions of the plan, and it was unclear what a final roadmap for PJM's handling of data centers would be.

Data centers are expected to account for nearly all of the 32 gigwatts of demand growth PJM forecasts on its system through 2030. Without significantly increasing power supplies, PJM has warned of power shortages in the region as early as 2027.

PJM covers Northern Virginia, which has the biggest global concentration of data centers. Other burgeoning hubs are developing in states, including Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic grid.

The power crunch has sent prices in PJM's annual capacity auction rising by more than 1,000% over the last two auctions.

The region's power bills started rising last summer. High prices in the auction are meant to encourage the build out of additional power plants and bring equilibrium to the market, but costs and supply chain problems have contributed to lengthy delays with building new power plants.

“About eight out of 10 Michiganders support clean energy investments, but the Trump administration is out of step with what our state wants and what Michiganders need.” As a result, Detroiters and Michiganders are seeing stalled progress and backward momentum on clean energy jobs, Chang said.
“So today, we are calling on the Trump administration to end the attacks on climate policy and clean energy investments.
Michiganders and Americans deserve clean air and good clean energy jobs, and the federal government should do its part.” Jamie Racklyeft, the executive director of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, argued against treating investments in clean energy as a partisan issue.
As members of the Legislature weigh what the future of the state’s tax incentives will look like for businesses, Chang said she was hopeful supporting clean energy jobs could be a part of that conversation.","Following an Australian clean energy company’s decision in September to cancel plans for a battery plant in Detroit, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) joined leaders from the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 58 to break down how the project could have helped the community.

Fortescue, a green technology and metals company, announced in 2024 that it would redevelop a vacant industrial building near the historic Ford Piquette Plant into a $210 million electric vehicle battery factory which was expected to create 600 jobs. However, that plan soured, with the company telling Crain’s Detroit Business that the “current policy settings and market conditions” including President Donald Trump’s Administration’s decision to eliminate “critical tax credits” for electric vehicles and clean energy were the driving force behind the decision to scrap the project.

Chang, who has served in the Legislature since 2015, noted that she has represented communities throughout Detroit who are facing environmental justice concerns, including disproportionate impacts from air pollution.

She noted that the Asthma and Allergy Foundation had ranked Detroit as the most challenging city in the nation for people with asthma based on the prevalence of asthma, and the higher than average number of asthma deaths, with vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions serving as major risk factors for individuals with respiratory conditions.

The Fortescue plant would have been an amazing example of revitalization for the city, Chang said, with construction crews already working on remediation and electrical upgrades. However, the Trump Administration’s move to cut support for clean energy and transportation put a stop to that, Chang said.

“And this is after $12.7 million in state incentives and $11 million in Detroit incentives that were offered and thankfully were not paid out due to the cancelation,” Chang said. “About eight out of 10 Michiganders support clean energy investments, but the Trump administration is out of step with what our state wants and what Michiganders need.”

As a result, Detroiters and Michiganders are seeing stalled progress and backward momentum on clean energy jobs, Chang said.

The potential health benefits that could have come alongside the adoption of more EVs and clean energy sources will also go unrealized, Chang said,

“Detroiters with asthma are going to continue to suffer. Clean air would have led to better health and more worker productivity, but we are going to be losing out on this opportunity.” Chang said. “So today, we are calling on the Trump administration to end the attacks on climate policy and clean energy investments. Michiganders and Americans deserve clean air and good clean energy jobs, and the federal government should do its part.”

Jamie Racklyeft, the executive director of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, argued against treating investments in clean energy as a partisan issue.

“Michigan now has well over 120,000 people working in clean energy and clean transportation jobs, with the sector growing faster than the overall economy and ranking among the strongest in the nation,” Racklyeft said. “Every lost project means fewer paychecks, slower neighborhood revitalization and more tailpipe and smokestack pollution in places that have already carried that burden for generations.”

Meanwhile, China continues to dominate the EV market, while the U.S. only makes up a small margin of EVs sold, Racklyeft said.

“Analysts are warning the continued policy uncertainty here will only help China pull farther ahead in the global EV race,” Racklyeft said. “This is the real choice in front of us. Do we want to import the clean vehicles of the future, or design, engineer and build better vehicles here in Detroit and across Michigan?”

Andrew Dueweke, the assistant business manager for the IBEW Local 58, similarly called for people to look past the politics on clean energy.

“Who knows when this investment might be able to come back to the city,” Dueweke said.

US$ 196 million financing helped to introduce innovative climate resilience measures

Project supported by EBRD and GCF

The launch of all six hydroelectric units of the Qairokkum hydropower plant (QHPP) has marked the completion of a major renewables project in Tajikistan. Rehabilitation measures at QHPP, which provides electricity to 500,000 people in the Sughd province, included concrete dam works and the installation of hydraulic steel components, turbines and electromechanical equipment. As a result, the plant’s installed capacity has increased from 126 MW to 174 MW. The upgrade introduced innovative climate-resilience measures, enabling the plant to cope with the expected impact of climate change on the country’s hydrological systems.

Initiated in 2019, the upgrade was supported by a US$ 196 million financing package organised by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The package consisted of an US$ 88 million EBRD loan, a US$ 37 million loan from the European Investment Bank, a US$ 50 million Green Climate Fund loan and grant and a US$ 21 million CIF loan and grant to the state-owned power utility Barki Tojik. The project also received support from the governments of Austria and the United Kingdom.

Tajikistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Its glacial hydrology and, by extension, its hydropower sector, are highly sensitive to the impacts of climate change, but the project is a model of how carefully designed investments can make hydropower more resilient. This model is likely to be replicated across the country and the wider region.

Hurricane Ida hit the Gulf Coast of the US in 2021. Louisiana bore the brunt of its devastation; Ida was the second-most destructive tropical cyclone on record.

For DEMCO, a not-for-profit, member-owned electric-distribution co-operative, it was an unprecedented crisis. In these moments, an outage management system (OMS) is critical. During the hurricane, Hitachi Energy’s OMS, working in tandem with DEMCO’s other reporting systems, filled in vital gaps, spotting outages before they had been reported so that DEMCO knew exactly where its linemen were needed. Chief engineering and operations officer, Mark Phillips, estimates that without the OMS it would have taken “double, possibly triple” the time to bring power back after the hurricane. Hitachi Energy’s OMS is “state of the art”, he says. “It gives our systems operators full visibility of our grid. There are no blind spots.” Today, the Hitachi Energy OMS delivers insights that DEMCO uses to refine its operations. When it comes to extreme weather, Phillips is phlegmatic: “It’s not a matter of if but when.” Keeping the grid operational demands unceasing courage and hard work. With Hitachi Energy’s OMS, DEMCO’s heroic team has a handy ace up its sleeve.

Developers and landlords with apartment buildings in Detroit say that the situation has become nearly unworkable as a business model, but believe changes in policy would substantially help.

They cite nonpayment of rent from tenants and high Detroit property taxes as two root causes.

Detroit developer Clifford Brown says that Detroit poses unique challenges.

“I am blessed and grateful to do development in the city of Detroit. I love the city of Detroit,” he said. “I’m blessed to do deals in the state of Michigan, but I can’t act like every deal that I do doesn’t have hair on it when deals in other markets don’t. It’s tough to create a scaleable business model. I know everyone is working like hell to find a solution while meeting the needs of residents of the city we serve.”

And it’s a worthy fight, they say.

“I think the challenge that we've seen is a very punitive property tax environment that compresses values for new buyers, (and) that don't necessarily align with what sellers' expectations are in order for them to sell the properties at a palatable price,"" said Matt Jones, managing director for investment sales in the Grand Rapids office of brokerage firm Walker & Dunlop.

There are other issues, such as job growth in the city, said Kevin Dillon, senior managing director of investment sales in the Birmingham office of Berkadia.

“Kids coming out of college, I don’t think they are getting jobs in downtown Detroit like they used to be. The workforce down there isn’t expanding rapidly,"" he said.

Some solutions

There have been some measures that bring help, though developers say more are needed. Detroit has rolled out the PILOT program, which allows payment in lieu of taxes. Property taxes tied to a building’s assessed value are replaced with a percentage of rental revenue. Developers who opt in to PILOT agree to keep rental rates at a below-market rate in exchange for a reduction in taxes, in some cases upwards of 90%, city officials have touted.

Measures other cities are trying, such as the RENTAL Act in Washington, D.C., speed up the eviction process when tenants don’t pay, and are worth a look, local experts say.

But the most meaningful reform, many believe, must come through state and city policies, especially on property taxes.

Jones, the Walker & Dunlop broker, is hopeful for such an outcome.

“I’m optimistic that there can be common sense property tax reform that improves the transaction market,” he said. “You want a healthy transaction market in any city because it encourages more development. It’s a sign of a healthy market when you have a good diversity of capital coming in and out, versus a static transaction market where there are no transactions.”

What if it isn’t solved?

Already, landlords say, units are sitting empty because developers can’t make a profit and can’t find buyers for the buildings. Some have stopped paying the mortgages on the buildings.

Solid-state batteries are at the forefront of innovation, with many manufacturers focusing on how to build them to-scale.

These batteries could create longer-running electric vehicles, making the cars safer to run and more efficient on the road.

Battery innovation

Solid-state batteries rely on a solid electrolyte as opposed to liquid electrolytes, which rely on lithium-ion technology. It is a rechargeable battery, which can store more energy than traditional lithium-ion batteries. As a result, it can offer greater safety and longer lifespans, as well as being more stable at higher temperatures.

As a result, car manufacturers are turning to this product to run electric vehicles (EVs). These vehicles require batteries which can cope with the weight of the car and is safety-assured. However, these manufacturers have been working on scalable batteries for a decade, attempting to become the first to produce an efficient solid-state battery car.

In theory, solid-state batteries will provide a larger driving range, higher safety and faster charging speeds for EVs. Semi-solid state EVs are already available for purchase in some parts of the world, but full SSBs have been more difficult to build to-scale. Automakers around the world are working hard to bring these batteries to the public and create a safer, longer-lasting EV.

Carmaker Stellantis has partnered with Factorial Energy, a manufacturer of renewable energy semiconducters. Stellantis will be using Factorial's solid-state batteries in its fleet of Dodge Charger Daytona EVs, which are set to be on the road in 2026 as a demonstration fleet.

However, Dongfeng, a Chinese carmaker, has said it will be bringing solid-state EVs to road sooner than expected.

A leading manufacturer

Dongfeng Motor Corporation Limited is a major driver of China's automotive industry. Its products are sold in more than 100 countries around the world and it is placed within the world's Top 500. It is a leader in industrial R&D, manufacturing and marketing.

Its production includes passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, NEVs, machines and equipment, auto assembles, parts and components, as well as other automobile-related products and services. Alongside full series of vehicles, the company has a selection of new-energy vehicles, including HEV, all-electric and natural gas vehicles.

Now, the company is putting its efforts into the deployment of a solid-state battery EV. It has an R&D staff count of more than 7,000 members, with its own significant automobile test base and self-assembly capability in China.

Dongfeng's leading product

The new fleet is due to come out in September 2026, using a battery with a 350wh/kg energy density. The battery will be capable of reaching a range of 621 miles on full charge once fitted into Dongfeng's fleet of EVs. Its 0.2GWh pilot production line is already established and operational, suggesting the deployment will be smooth-sailing.

The battery is made up of a multi-component layout with a high-capacity ternary cathode, a silicon-carbon anode and an oxide polymer composite solid electrolyte. Dongfeng claims the battery has a high temperature range, meaning it is safe and usable in any climate. According to the carmaker, the solid-state battery has been tested at temperatures as low as -22°F (-30°C), retaining more than 72% of its capacity - as opposed to 60% for liquid-state ternary batteries - and at a high of 266°F (130°C).

At present, Dongfeng has not reported how long the battery takes to reach full charge, but it is already working on a fast-charging version of the solid-state battery, which is planned to be deployed across vehicles in December 2027. Furthermore, it is exploring the concept of a sulfide-based solid-state battery with an energy density of 500 Wh/kg.

(AP) — The Trump administration has once again extended the life of a Michigan coal-fired power plant that was supposed to close last May as the utility Consumers Energy transitions to cleaner sources of electricity.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan’s attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” Earthjustice lawyer Michael Lenoff said.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

Michigan utility regulators criticized the May order to keep Campbell open but declined to comment on the latest extension.

As the COP30 climate summit wraps up in Brazil’s Amazonian hub of Belém, activists are dispersing after two weeks of rain forest photo ops, protest disruptions and impassioned speeches on slashing carbon emissions. But participants sidestepped the stark reality: The actions of western nations — including Canada — have less and less sway over the trajectory of global warming.

For decades now, western governments, especially in Europe, have prioritized carbon cuts over higher economic growth, spending trillions of dollars to convince consumers to adopt electric cars and accept more costly, less reliable wind and solar power. Yet all these expensive efforts are barely making a dent.

The global decarbonization rate (measured as CO₂ emissions over GDP) has remained roughly constant since the 1960s, with no change following the 2015 Paris Agreement. Global emissions have skyrocketed, reaching a new record last year. Despite this, climate campaigners demand that the world quadruple its decarbonization rate.

Article content

Why are emissions still increasing when the EU and the United States spent more than $700 billion last year on green investments like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, hydrogen, electric cars and power grids? Because rich-world emissions matter very little for climate change in the 21st century.

Article content

The West did dominate emissions in previous centuries, but future emissions will come overwhelmingly from China, India, Africa, Brazil, Indonesia and many other countries clambering out of poverty. One recent scenario shows that under current policies, just 13 per cent of CO₂ emissions over the rest of this century will come from the mostly rich and western countries of the OECD.

Article content

Article content

The West’s pledge to achieve net-zero by 2050 will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars yet do little. Most likely, the policy will simply shift energy-intensive production to the rest of the world with little overall impact on emissions — just as EV battery manufacturing has shifted to China’s coal-powered economy.

North America’s power shortage could offer a key window for China’s equipment manufacturing industry to expand abroad.","(Yicai) Nov. 20 -- North America is facing mounting power shortages driven by explosive growth in demand for artificial intelligence computing, creating a significant opportunity for Chinese companies to expand overseas, according to a new research report by China International Capital Corporation.

CICC, a leading investment bank, said the acceleration of AI model training by major US cloud service providers is straining an aging American power grid, where coal and gas facilities are being retired faster than new capacity can be built. Constructing new gas-fired power plants typically takes more than three years, while nuclear projects require five to 10 years.

US net electricity imports surged 125 percent year on year to 20.94 terawatt-hours in the first nine months of this year, data from the US Energy Information Administration showed, and CICC forecasts the country could face an average annual power shortfall of about 15 gigawatts over the next five years.

Gas turbines are emerging as the most viable short-term solution due to their fast response and short construction cycles, CICC noted. Global leaders such as GE and Siemens are expanding output, while Chinese manufacturers involved in contract manufacturing and supplying key components such as blades, castings, and materials are expected to benefit.

CICC estimated that the supply-demand gap for transformers in North America could reach as high as 66 percent from 2024 to 2027, positioning China as a crucial supplier to help close the deficit. China exported USD6.5 billion worth of transformers in the first nine months of this year, up 39 percent from a year earlier. Energy storage systems are also set to gain from regulatory requirements tied to the “roller coaster” electricity consumption patterns of data centers.

Photovoltaic renewable energy is becoming an important supplementary power source due to its rapid deployment capabilities, and frontier technologies such as solid oxide fuel cells are also attracting attention. Rising demand for aluminum used in power cables may further support the non-ferrous metals sector.

Analysts said that in the new stage of China-US economic and trade relations, Chinese companies are accelerating their integration into global value chains by leveraging institutional advantages, economies of scale, and industrial cluster effects. North America’s power shortage could offer a key window for China’s equipment manufacturing industry to expand abroad.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-11-20 11:00:23+00:00,News From The States,A modest proposal for AI data centers: Invest in small and local solar projects,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/modest-proposal-ai-data-centers-invest-small-and-local-solar-projects,"Over the past decade, Virginia has become home to more than 650 data centers — the largest concentration on Earth — including roughly 150 hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta.
Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.
We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia.
Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia.
Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.","Over the past decade, Virginia has become home to more than 650 data centers — the largest concentration on Earth — including roughly 150 hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta. Loudoun County alone hosts nearly 200 operating sites, with more than 100 additional facilities in development.

Regulators and lawmakers are now confronting soaring peak demand and rising grid costs for Virginia ratepayers. Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.

Data center growth has come at a cost. They already consume more than one-quarter of Virginia’s electricity, a share projected to approach half of statewide demand by 2030. Dominion Energy has told regulators that serving this new hyperscale load will require billions of dollars in new generation and transmission infrastructure — costs increasingly passed on to ordinary Virginians through rate hikes.

As it is, Virginia imports roughly 39% of its electricity — more than any other state — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, buying much of that power at a premium. Options to meet that demand require five to ten or more years of development, whether new natural gas, small modular nuclear, or utility-scale solar. In contrast, small-scale rooftop and ground-mounted solar can be built and interconnected in less than a year.

Since 2010, Virginia’s sales- and use-tax exemption has provided data-center operators with more than $2 billion in cumulative subsidies, justified as job creation. Yet most jobs were temporary construction work.

We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) reported last year that the sector supports about 74,000 jobs statewide, mostly indirect or short-term, while a typical operating facility employs only around 50 full-time workers. In FY 2023 alone, this exemption cost taxpayers $928 million.

A modest, market-based solution

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger said it best in her acceptance speech: “Data centers need to pay their fair share.” Virginia can take her message to heart by inviting the industry to make a small, voluntary, high-impact contribution toward the commonwealth’s clean-energy goals and local development.

Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia. Each SREC represents one megawatt-hour of solar generation; purchasing them helps finance projects and provides verifiable carbon offsets to the buyer.

The program would support any and all solar systems under 3 MW on public schools, hospitals, community colleges and municipal buildings — projects that lower energy bills and strengthen local economies.

With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Using JLARC’s FY 2023 figure of $928 million in annual tax savings, a 5% annual contribution would yield about $46 million per year for the purchase of Virginia-generated SRECs — enough to help finance over 500 MW of distributed solar capacity annually to benefit schools and communities.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Jobs and Economic Impact (JEDI) model, this voluntary program would each year:

Leverage $1.1 billion in private-sector investment in distributed solar

Generate more than $700 million in local economic activity

Create over 2,800 good-paying Virginia jobs.

All of this would be achieved without adding a single cent to ratepayer bills, while reducing taxpayer subsidies and helping stabilize Virginia’s solar industry by offsetting the abrupt and disruptive phase-down of federal investment tax credits.

From additionality to multiplicity

For years, the technology industry has subscribed to what might be called the Gospel of Additionality — the idea that eco-virtue is earned by sourcing the largest and cheapest quantities of clean energy. This approach has sent corporate energy dollars to Texas wind farms and Arizona solar plants while companies continued to draw fossil-based power here in Virginia.

Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.

By purchasing Virginia DG SRECs data-center operators could:

Lower energy costs for public schools, hospitals, and local governments at no capital cost to them

Help offset summer coincident peak demand in the Mid-Atlantic PJM grid area more quickly and affordably than any other generation option

Reduce taxpayer burden by cutting energy costs for public institutions

Avoid ratepayer-funded SREC subsidies through a voluntary, market-based mechanism

Create durable local jobs and workforce training tied to installation, operations and maintenance

A good-neighbor contribution would show that an industry running on public infrastructure can also reinvest in the communities that power it. Data-center operators could help schools, hospitals and small towns across the commonwealth generate clean, affordable solar energy — a sure and equitable way for them to pay their fair share.

And importantly, this modest proposal is designed to complement, not replace, a longer-term, holistic strategy for meeting Virginia’s energy needs by offering a simple, fast, and low-cost way to buy the commonwealth the time it urgently needs.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-va1763634255.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=lAnRZoNU,N,,2025-11-20 12:02:52.757462

Wopke Hoekstra, Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, said he wanted “to be crystal clear” repeatedly at yesterday’s European Commission press conference.

He insisted the bloc is “doubling down on the energy transition,” frequently citing policy measures such as Fit for 55 and the European Green Deal.

Europe’s main climate targets are to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.

Accompanying him, Lidia Pereira, heading the European Parliament delegation to COP30, highlighted Europe’s aim to be a major hub for new technologies, including carbon capture and storage, and encouraged Brazil to follow its lead.

“It is necessary to invest in clean technologies – environment and economy are not against each other,” she said.

But beneath the unified messaging, not everything is clear on a range of fronts.

It remains to be seen how quickly Europe will implement changes, which is one of COP30’s central themes. And Europe’s push on climate finance is under pressure from strains on public budgets and geopolitics.

Moreover, India, China and other countries are challenging CBAM in climate talks, ahead of the financially binding regime starting on 1 January 2026. The price of CBAM certificates will be pegged to the weekly average auction price of allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

Environmental groups are concerned the EU’s policies are not ambitious enough and are not providing a strong enough roadmap for transitioning away from fossil fuels.

However, Europe’s overall carbon emissions fell in 2024, with preliminary estimates showing a further 2.5% reduction compared with 2023 levels.

This is part of a long-term trend driven by renewable energy, higher energy efficiency and decarbonisation of the power sector.

Hoekstra stressed that 94% of emissions take place outside the EU. The implication is that Europe’s actions won’t make or break the global climate. But he said it would work hard tackling the 6% it can control.

“What matters is that we focus not only on ‘transitioning away’ [the COP28 pledge] but also on the doubling and tripling of commitments,” he said.

“What the whole world needs is more sustainable economic growth – not the type of growth we’ve had before, And an [economic] distribution that is fairer than it is today.

Shapiro abandons Pennsylvania's landmark climate initiative",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-years-sparring-gov-shapiro-abandons-pennsylvanias-landmark-climate-initiative,"Pennsylvania is the fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter in the nation, and for years, RGGI was considered its landmark climate policy.
Pennsylvania is now the first state with a Democratic governor to leave the regional climate program, which includes New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has attempted to repeal those funds, a move that the Shapiro administration has countered with a lawsuit.
The day after the state budget was signed, the Shapiro administration filed applications to discontinue its involvement in both court cases.
“For years, Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” Shapiro said.","This article was first published by Capital & Main.

When the Republican minority leader of Pennsylvania’s state House took the podium, as final floor debate over the state’s months-delayed state budget kicked off, he was resolute: A landmark climate initiative — which he dismissed as a “specter” — was holding back the state.

“After today,” said Rep. Jesse Topper, who is from south central Pennsylvania, “that specter will be gone.”

As he spoke, he celebrated what environmentalists and some Democratic lawmakers have for weeks been warning the state not to do: Leave the regional carbon-trading program that it set out to enter in 2019.

A key pillar of former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s climate legacy, the 10-state compact caps the amount of planet-warming emissions that power plants within it are allowed to release. It also requires the plants to purchase the ability to emit carbon via quarterly auctions, whose proceeds are invested in environmental initiatives like energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Trade unions and fossil fuel industry trade groups have long argued that the carbon trading program would stymie the state’s energy industry and lead to higher utility bills.

Environmentalists, meanwhile, saw the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI, as an effective way to curb emissions from the power sector, though some argued the program did not go far enough. Pennsylvania is the fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter in the nation, and for years, RGGI was considered its landmark climate policy.

The state’s entry into the compact fueled years of partisan sparring and two unresolved lawsuits that await a verdict from the state Supreme Court. As part of the deal to drop out of the compact, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration, a party in both cases, is pulling out of the lawsuits.

Democrats spent years staving off attacks from Republicans and the fossil fuel industry over the program.

To end a months-long budget impasse, Democrats did not just fold to these sustained attacks on Nov. 12, but conceded to offer RGGI as a “bargaining chip” to bring Republicans back to the bargaining table, Spotlight PA reported. Pennsylvania is now the first state with a Democratic governor to leave the regional climate program, which includes New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.

“It was a shocking reversal on a very significant climate policy,” said Jen Quinn, legislative and political director at the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club. “I don’t think there’s any other way to say it besides [we are] shocked and disappointed.”

The move came as part of a $50.1 billion budget that Shapiro signed into law 135 days after the June 30 annual deadline to do so — ending a bitter impasse that left schools, counties and nonprofits without funding, and that overlapped with the 43-day federal government shutdown.

Gov. Shapiro’s office did not comment on the record regarding the move to pull out of RGGI.

Tucked into the budget were a mixed bag of climate policies, including a renewed $25 million for a hotly demanded grant program to install solar panels on schools — the same appropriation the program received last year. The budget also repeals the hold state lawmakers put on the use of millions in federal funds for low-income residential solar projects last year. The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has attempted to repeal those funds, a move that the Shapiro administration has countered with a lawsuit. Despite progress at the state level, the program is still in limbo.

“It’s like a drop in the bucket,” David Masur, executive director of nonprofit PennEnvironment, said of the impact of solar funding in this year’s budget compared to the losses that come with eliminating RGGI (pronounced Reggie).

The deal also includes new provisions requiring state regulators to hit shorter deadlines throughout the permitting process for certain industrial projects, deeming some approved if those deadlines are missed — a move environmentalists fear could lead to projects being rubber-stamped. A spokesperson for the Shapiro administration told Capital & Main the measure amounts to “providing more certainty for businesses while still providing the environmental and public health protections that Pennsylvanians deserve.”

The budget also includes a provision requiring state utility regulators to audit the way the region’s grid operator, PJM, calculates future demand on the grid, a process known as load forecasting. If PJM overanticipates demand, taxpayers could get stuck footing the bill for unneeded energy projects. If it underestimates it, they could see rolling blackouts. Getting it right is crucial, advocates say.

Though she considers solar funding and increased attention to load forecasting as wins for consumers and the climate, Quinn, the Sierra Club legislative director, said this year’s budget package is, on the whole, “a step backwards.”

Rep. Greg Vitali, Democratic chair of the House Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, didn’t mince words. “Bad budget for the environment,” he told Capital & Main shortly after the budget deal was adopted Wednesday.

Vitali, who is from Delaware County, north of Philadelphia, broke ranks with his party, one of just four House Democrats to do so, in voting against a key budget bill which contained the language removing Pennsylvania from RGGI. He was despondent on the House floor in the minutes leading up to the vote.

“I understand that environmental protection is not highly valued in this General Assembly,” he told his colleagues. “I also understand that my words will not affect any, or many, votes.”

Though he waffled on RGGI while on the campaign trail in 2022, after taking office the following year Gov. Shapiro convened a working group that brought together parties that were historically on opposite sides of the debate over the controversial program — environmentalists, labor unions, consumer advocates and energy producers.

Masur, the nonprofit director, was part of that working group and left those talks feeling optimistic. Watching RGGI’s repeal felt like “a pretty big tectonic shift,” he said.

After nine meetings, the working group concluded in 2023 that a cap-and-invest program was the best way to reduce emissions from the power sector while generating funds for renewable energy. In response, Shapiro introduced the Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction Act, known as PACER, which would require power plants to pay for the greenhouse gasses they emit — funds that would be rebated on consumer’s utility bills and go toward pollution reduction programs. It was introduced in the 2023-2024 legislative session, then again in 2025 as part of a package of bills the governor dubbed the “Lightning Plan.”

No components of the Lightning Plan were part of this year’s final budget deal. In fact, PACER has stalled for close to two years. Had it reached the governor’s desk and been signed, it would then have removed the state from RGGI in favor of the state-run alternative.

That Democrats did not secure an alternative to RGGI, or another meaningful climate program, in exchange for pulling out of the compact marked a wasted opportunity, environmentalists say.

“The RGGI repeal was shocking and disappointing,” Masur said. “I think it’s made worse by the fact that it wasn’t really like there was some quid pro quo.”

The move comes as the state is preparing for a slate of newpower plants to come online to provide energy to data centers for the artificial intelligence sector, likely increasing residents’ utility rates in the process.

Republicans applauded the withdrawal from RGGI as a win for consumers’ electricity bills. The Commonwealth Foundation, a right-wing thinktank, alongside industrial labor unions and the energy industry have asserted that RGGI would increase consumer bills by 30%.

Environmentalists say this is a fallacy. For instance, in 2023, the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy found that the state would gain as much as $148 million in 2030 by participating in RGGI, with no impact on consumer electricity rates or employment levels. Others have estimated that the state lost out on closer to $1 billionin a single year. At least one analysis from 2019 found electricity prices had dropped across RGGI member states while raising money for projects like energy efficiency and renewables, which environmentalists argue will save consumers money in the long run.

Though Pennsylvania was technically part of the compact, its participation was halted by a 2022 injunction and has since been tied up in litigation. Pennsylvania has never participated in an RGGI auction. Shapiro’s administration, meanwhile, has defended the program in state court, spending millions in the process. At question in these cases is whether RGGI constitutes a tax or a fee, which would determine whether the Wolf administration overstepped in entering the compact by executive order instead of seeking approval from the legislative branch, which was then controlled by Republicans. The day after the state budget was signed, the Shapiro administration filed applications to discontinue its involvement in both court cases.

Robert Routh, policy director of climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that in crafting the budget deal, the administration was taking a gamble on the likelihood that the state Supreme Court would strike the program down on its own. Such a gamble is shortsighted, he said. A Supreme Court verdict could help shape climate policy for years to come.

“We don’t know how the case would have been decided, but there were key legal issues pending to determine how this administration and future administrations design rules to control air pollution in Pennsylvania,” he said. Now, “We won’t have that guidance or clarity.”

Shortly before signing the series of budget bills into law, including the fiscal code that struck down RGGI, Shapiro said at a press conference that the move would alleviate a sticking point that had long hampered negotiations.

“For years, Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” Shapiro said. “Today, that excuse is gone.

“I’m looking forward to aggressively pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto our grid and reduce the cost of energy for all Pennsylvanians,” he vowed.

Environmental watchdogs remain dubious. Many of these policies require buy-in from the divided state Legislature — the lack of which caused the ultimate demise of RGGI in Pennsylvania. “It’s pretty clear, in this General Assembly, no meaningful legislation is going to be passed to address climate change,” Vitali said on the House floor ahead of the budget vote.

Quinn agreed that none of Shapiro’s past climate pitches have seemed to come with much political capital. But she said she hopes to hold him to his promise nonetheless.

“We don’t have anything similar on the books,” she said. “We want to see that come from him.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/power-station-springdale-1024x5401763634051.jpeg?h=dc8f5cd0&itok=dV5zK74f,N,,2025-11-20 11:04:45.332436

Loudoun County alone hosts nearly 200 operating sites, with more than 100 additional facilities in development.

Regulators and lawmakers are now confronting soaring peak demand and rising grid costs for Virginia ratepayers. Now is the moment for the commonwealth to adopt a straightforward, market-based solution that delivers more affordable energy and ensures data centers pay their fair share — all for only a modest contribution.

Data center growth has come at a cost. They already consume more than one-quarter of Virginia’s electricity, a share projected to approach half of statewide demand by 2030. Dominion Energy has told regulators that serving this new hyperscale load will require billions of dollars in new generation and transmission infrastructure — costs increasingly passed on to ordinary Virginians through rate hikes.

As it is, Virginia imports roughly 39% of its electricity — more than any other state — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, buying much of that power at a premium. Options to meet that demand require five to ten or more years of development, whether new natural gas, small modular nuclear, or utility-scale solar. In contrast, small-scale rooftop and ground-mounted solar can be built and interconnected in less than a year.

Since 2010, Virginia’s sales- and use-tax exemption has provided data-center operators with more than $2 billion in cumulative subsidies, justified as job creation. Yet most jobs were temporary construction work.

We suspected data centers were creating an energy crisis for Virginia. Now it’s official.

The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) reported last year that the sector supports about 74,000 jobs statewide, mostly indirect or short-term, while a typical operating facility employs only around 50 full-time workers. In FY 2023 alone, this exemption cost taxpayers $928 million.

A modest, market-based solution

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger said it best in her acceptance speech: “Data centers need to pay their fair share.” Virginia can take her message to heart by inviting the industry to make a small, voluntary, high-impact contribution toward the commonwealth’s clean-energy goals and local development.

Here’s the proposal: Data centers would contribute a small percentage of their avoided state sales-tax liability each year toward purchasing Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) under the distributed generation (DG) carve-out for small-scale solar projects operating in Virginia. Each SREC represents one megawatt-hour of solar generation; purchasing them helps finance projects and provides verifiable carbon offsets to the buyer.

The program would support any and all solar systems under 3 MW on public schools, hospitals, community colleges and municipal buildings — projects that lower energy bills and strengthen local economies.

With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

Using JLARC’s FY 2023 figure of $928 million in annual tax savings, a 5% annual contribution would yield about $46 million per year for the purchase of Virginia-generated SRECs — enough to help finance over 500 MW of distributed solar capacity annually to benefit schools and communities.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Jobs and Economic Impact (JEDI) model, this voluntary program would each year:

Leverage $1.1 billion in private-sector investment in distributed solar

Generate more than $700 million in local economic activity

Create over 2,800 good-paying Virginia jobs.

All of this would be achieved without adding a single cent to ratepayer bills, while reducing taxpayer subsidies and helping stabilize Virginia’s solar industry by offsetting the abrupt and disruptive phase-down of federal investment tax credits.

From additionality to multiplicity

For years, the technology industry has subscribed to what might be called the Gospel of Additionality — the idea that eco-virtue is earned by sourcing the largest and cheapest quantities of clean energy. This approach has sent corporate energy dollars to Texas wind farms and Arizona solar plants while companies continued to draw fossil-based power here in Virginia.

Our modest proposal offers a different creed: Multiplicity — where one small investment multiplies benefits across the commonwealth’s schools, hospitals, and communities.

By purchasing Virginia DG SRECs data-center operators could:

Lower energy costs for public schools, hospitals, and local governments at no capital cost to them

Help offset summer coincident peak demand in the Mid-Atlantic PJM grid area more quickly and affordably than any other generation option

Reduce taxpayer burden by cutting energy costs for public institutions

Avoid ratepayer-funded SREC subsidies through a voluntary, market-based mechanism

Create durable local jobs and workforce training tied to installation, operations and maintenance

A good-neighbor contribution would show that an industry running on public infrastructure can also reinvest in the communities that power it. Data-center operators could help schools, hospitals and small towns across the commonwealth generate clean, affordable solar energy — a sure and equitable way for them to pay their fair share.

And importantly, this modest proposal is designed to complement, not replace, a longer-term, holistic strategy for meeting Virginia’s energy needs by offering a simple, fast, and low-cost way to buy the commonwealth the time it urgently needs.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-VA.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 06:58:33.943559

Tom Davis represents Beaufort and Jasper counties in the South Carolina Senate.","South Carolina stands at a crossroads. Our state faces surging electricity demand driven by population growth, advanced manufacturing, and data center expansion. Meanwhile, two partially built nuclear reactors at VC Summer in Fairfield County have sat dormant since July 2017. The Santee Cooper Board’s unanimous decision on Oct. 24 to enter final negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management to sell and complete those reactors with private capital changes everything.

This proposed deal transforms an abandoned liability into a strategic asset. It delivers 2,200 megawatts of reliable baseload power without asking taxpayers for another dime, positioning South Carolina as the national leader in America's nuclear resurgence.

Nuclear power remains the only reliable, scalable energy source capable of meeting our state’s growing needs. While wind and solar have their place, they cannot provide the around-the-clock baseload power that manufacturers, data centers, and households depend on. As China accelerates nuclear deployment and states like Texas and Tennessee expand their energy portfolios, South Carolina cannot afford to sit on the sidelines.

The Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design represents a quantum leap in safety. It features passive safety systems that rely on gravity and natural circulation rather than pumps, meaning the reactor can safely shut down and cool itself even during complete power loss. This eliminates vulnerabilities that led to accidents like Three Mile Island and Fukushima. If power systems fail, physics takes over, with water naturally flowing downward to cool the reactor core, and heat naturally rising to dissipate through the containment structure. No human intervention, electricity, or backup generators needed.

The deal has been thoroughly de-risked. Since July 2017, Westinghouse has successfully delivered six AP1000 units worldwide, including Georgia’s Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which now power more than one million homes. Fourteen more units are under construction in China. Construction efficiencies improved 30 percent between Vogtle’s third and fourth units, and the design is licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission until 2046.

Critically, Santee Cooper has maintained VC Summer in good condition since 2017, keeping the site among the best-preserved nuclear assets globally. We’re not starting from scratch; we're finishing what we started.

The financial structure protects South Carolina ratepayers while securing massive benefits. Brookfield's proposal includes a multi-billion-dollar ratepayer relief package and provides Santee Cooper with percentage ownership and power share through a structure that delivers below-market electricity rates without equity investment or project-level financial risk.

Brookfield brings extraordinary resources: approximately $1 trillion in assets under management, including $500 billion invested in U.S. infrastructure. As majority owner of Westinghouse, Brookfield uniquely aligns capital, technology, and execution expertise.

Beyond electricity generation, Brookfield's investment will rebuild South Carolina's nuclear workforce and strengthen the state’s manufacturing ecosystem. The project will prioritize South Carolina vendors and suppliers, creating sustained demand for local businesses. Through partnerships with trade schools and universities, Brookfield will establish comprehensive training pipelines for nuclear technicians, welders, and engineers.

This commitment to workforce development will revitalize the Midlands economy and position South Carolina as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and nuclear research. The ripple effects will extend far beyond Fairfield County, creating opportunities for the next generation of South Carolinians in careers that didn’t exist when the project was first conceived.

The alternative is leaving 2,200 megawatts of potential capacity on the table while competitors surge ahead. South Carolina has a chance to turn a painful chapter into a success story. The Brookfield-Santee Cooper partnership delivers reliable power, protects ratepayers, creates jobs, requires no new taxpayer funding, and positions our state as a national energy leader.

DALLAS, TEXAS (November 19, 2025) – Monday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin shared 100 additional environmental accomplishments EPA has achieved in the last 100 days, recognizing 300 days of fulfilling the agency’s statutory obligations, and delivering clean air, land, and water for all Americans under President Donald Trump’s leadership.

EPA Region 6 led the response to the Smitty’s Supply fire in Roseland, Louisiana, to remove over 11 million gallons of waste from the Tangipahoa River and surrounding waterways and engage with over 3,000 residents. Region 6 also issued a Safe Drinking Water Act permit for ExxonMobil’s Rose Low Carbon Solutions Class VI injection wells in Jefferson County and a Clean Air Act permit to Texas GulfLink for a deepwater port southeast of Freeport. These permits enable significant projects to move forward, creating jobs and boosting the nation’s energy economy. Region 6 also provided oversight of the depressurization of four flanged tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Air monitoring for tritium indicated no deviation from background levels.

Nationwide, this progress includes announcing a proposed rule that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of “pressure testing” Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

These 100 actions build on Administrator Zeldin’s list of 100 pro-environmental actions taken by the agency during President Trump’s First 100 Days in office and another 100 pro-environmental actions highlighted at the 200-day milestone to total 300 featured accomplishments.

“We are thrilled to announce another 100 top accomplishments from the last 100 days in our mission to meet our statutory duties and defend human health and environmental quality,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “The Trump EPA is showing that we can be exceptional environmental stewards while Powering the Great American Comeback. 300 days, 300 major environmental wins – this is the energy that propels us forward and the pace that motivates us. We will keep working tirelessly to secure success after success for America’s environment and families nationwide.”

“EPA Region 6 is home to much of our nation’s energy, industry, and agriculture production as well as diverse landscapes and natural resources. Under the Trump Administration, our team has shown we can fulfill our mission to protect human health and the environment while not getting in the way of the economic development that’s Powering the Great American Comeback,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “We have accomplished a great deal in less than a year, and we’ll keep pushing to do even more for the environment, the economy, and the American people.”

This snapshot represents the great work done by the agency on a daily basis as EPA continues to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while committing to commonsense policies that drive down prices, unleash American energy, advance permitting reform and cooperative federalism, make America the AI capital of the world, and revitalize the auto industry.

Led emergency response at Smitty’s Supply explosion and fire in Louisiana deploying 464 EPA employees and contractors to conduct air monitoring and recover 7,622,181 gallons of oily waste and 3,769,668 gallons of CERCLA waste from the Tangipahoa River.

Signed final Clean Air Act Minor New Source Review permit for Texas GulfLink Deepwater Port, the first use of an offshore support vessel to house VOC vapor control technology.

Conducted oversight of the depressurization of four flanged tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.

Signed proposed approval of Oklahoma SIP Revisions for New Source Review permitting and general SIP updates, addressing 13 SIP submittals.

Approved Texas SIP for SO2 interstate transport requirements.

Announced a proposed rule that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of WOTUS under the Clean Water Act.

Completed 100 days of “pressure testing” Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects following the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico MOU, accelerating timelines by nine months while advancing funding discussions with Mexico that will contribute to permanently ending the flow of raw sewage from Mexico into the United States.

Issued an Interim Final Rule to cut red tape on the temporary-use Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incinerators (CISWI) for natural disaster debris removal, providing state, local and Tribal governments with the ability to quickly and effectively clean up their communities

Issued guidance directing regional offices to work with local, state, Tribal, and federal partners to remove barriers in State Implementation Plans (SIPs) that discourage prescribed fires.

Established orders under Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 5(e) for 68 new chemicals that may present unreasonable risk.

Proposed 144 and finalized 170 significant new use rules (SNURs) under TSCA for chemicals approved in the new chemicals program, ensuring these chemicals do not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment.

Decreased the backlog of pesticide submissions under review by over 5,200 from the start of the Administration to the beginning of November, ensuring growers and other users have the tools they need to protect our food supply, combat pests and respond to other public health and environmental issues.

Hosted a webinar for almost 400 building code officials covering lead hazards, EPA lead-safe work certification requirements, and protective practices during home renovations.

Streamlined review processes for over 3,000 company chemical risk notifications (including PFAS and pesticides), distributing 900+ to improve regulatory decisions protecting human health and the environment.

Issued vital guidance needed for publishing bilingual labels to better protect farmworkers and other users from pesticide exposures and ensure proper use.

Held a webinar attended by 882 participants aimed at training farmers, applicators, and other users on how to comply with Endangered Species Act label mitigations.

The vote overturns environmental protections put in place during the Biden administration, which shielded large swaths of Alaskan tundra from new oil and gas leasing.
Although the Biden-era rules still allowed for drilling in around 52 percent of the reserve, large swaths were saved for preservation.
Those concerns drove the Biden administration to put in place stronger protections for special areas with environmental or cultural significance.
Under the reversion to the 2020 plan, roughly 82 percent of the reserve will again be open to new drilling.","The U.S. House of Representatives voted Tuesday to strike down protections against oil drilling in some of the most diverse ecosystems and wildest lands left in North America. The resolution passed relatively quietly, but the bill will have an enormous impact on millions of acres in northern Alaska, the subject of a decades-long fight over conservation and drilling in the Arctic.

The vote overturns environmental protections put in place during the Biden administration, which shielded large swaths of Alaskan tundra from new oil and gas leasing. Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve encompasses roughly 23 million acres of land in the north of the state, making it the largest block of public land in the United States. The passage Tuesday of Senate Joint Resolution 80 nullifies the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) 2022 rules governing the National Petroleum Reserve, which closed off roughly half of the reserve to oil and gas projects.

Although the Biden-era rules still allowed for drilling in around 52 percent of the reserve, large swaths were saved for preservation. Those protected zones included key wildlife habitats, lands used by local communities and special areas like Teshekpuk Lake, one of the most diverse wetland ecosystems in the Arctic and a crucial area of passage for migratory bird populations.

Arkansas Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman, who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources, described the “resource-rich lands” in Alaska as “indispensable to unleashing American energy and mineral dominance” in a statement and celebrated the bill’s passage as a boon to Alaska’s economy, one that would “create jobs and promote access to affordable energy for years to come.” Westerman’s framing of the issue has been echoed by some Alaskan advocacy groups, including the Indigenous group Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, which expressed hopes that new drilling would boost tax revenue and improve state services.

The change comes amid a wave of Republican-led efforts to reverse Biden-era constraints on fossil fuel production, part of a larger push under President Donald Trump to increase domestic drilling and scrap environmental guardrails that constrain the energy sector. Alaska is a key battleground for those efforts, with the Department of the Interior estimating that the National Petroleum Reserve holds up to 25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 8.7 billion barrels of oil that could be extracted.

But environmental groups have been swift to point out there’s more than just fossil fuels in the nation’s largest federally managed land area. “This vote will authorize the fossil fuel industry’s continued destruction of habitat and landscapes that are critical for wildlife to survive,” Robert Dewey of the U.S. conservation group Defenders of Wildlife, said in a statement following the Senate vote.

While Republican majorities pushed the measure through the Senate last month and on Tuesday through the House, a few Democrats also backed the environmental rollbacks. In the Senate, Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman voted with Republicans and on Tuesday, Texas Democrats Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez joined Jim Costa of California to vote in favor. President Trump is expected to sign the measure.

With the BLM’s 2022 protections erased, rules governing the reserve will revert to the 2020 plan adopted during Trump’s first term, which opened more than 80 percent of the lands to potential oil and gas leasing—including sensitive sections of the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area that had been off limits for decades.

Environmental groups warned in 2020 that the plan would punch roads and pipelines through delicate wetlands, disrupt migration routes for caribou and waterfowl and fragment habitats in complex, interconnected ecosystems in the Arctic. Those concerns drove the Biden administration to put in place stronger protections for special areas with environmental or cultural significance. Three years later, those safeguards are on the verge of being dismantled entirely. Under the reversion to the 2020 plan, roughly 82 percent of the reserve will again be open to new drilling.

The National Petroleum Reserve has historically been framed as a dormant bank stocked with fuel, set aside in 1923 as a strategic oil supply for the U.S. Navy. But in recent decades, scientists and Indigenous communities have highlighted the cultural and ecological importance of the region. Coastal lagoons that shelter whales and walruses abut Arctic tundra home to polar bear and caribou populations. These ecosystems sustain the subsistence hunting and fishing that many Indigenous communities have relied on for generations.

The permafrost blanketing the reserve is also one of the world’s largest carbon stores. Oil development not only produces direct emissions from drilling in the ice, but can accelerate permafrost thaw, potentially releasing vast amounts of ancient carbon long locked in frozen tundra. Scientists warn that once released, that carbon cannot easily be recaptured.

The Biden administration in its approach to the reserve framed the areas as a globally significant climate refuge where oil and gas development needed to be tightly constrained. Tuesday’s vote is the latest signal that federal policy has shifted sharply away from those conservation principles and toward a landscape increasingly shaped by fossil fuel projects.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1487928387-1024x674.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 05:59:34.619190

s the COP30 climate conference wraps up in Brazil's Amazonian hub of Belém, activists are dispersing after two weeks of rainforest photo ops, protest disruptions and impassioned speeches on slashing carbon emissions. But participants sidestepped the stark reality: The actions of Western nations hold diminishing sway over the trajectory of global warming.

For decades now, Western governments, especially in Europe, prioritized carbon cuts over higher economic growth, spending trillions of dollars to convince consumers to adopt electric cars and accept more expensive, less reliable wind and solar power. All these expensive efforts are barely making a dent.

The global decarbonization rate, measured as carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over GDP, has remained roughly constant since the 1960s, with no change after the 2015 Paris Agreement. Global emissions have skyrocketed, reaching a new record high in 2024. Despite this, climate campaigners are unrealistically demanding that the world quadruple its decarbonization rate.

Why are emissions still increasing when the European Union and the United States spent more than US$700 billion in 2024 on green investments like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, hydrogen, electric cars and power grids? Because rich world emissions matter very little for climate change in the 21st century.

While the West dominated emissions in previous centuries, the vast amount of future emissions will come from China, India, Africa, Brazil, Indonesia and many other countries clambering out of poverty. One recent scenario shows that with current policies, just 13 percent of CO2 emissions over the rest of this century will come from the mostly rich, Western countries of the OECD.

The West’s pledge of achieving net zero by 2050 will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars and do little. Most likely, the policy will simply shift more energy-intensive production to the rest of the world with little overall impact on emissions, just as we have seen electric car battery manufacturing shift to China’s coal-powered economy.

If rich countries try to fix this problem with carbon border taxes, the costs will escalate further for both rich and poor countries while robbing the poor of the opportunity for export-driven growth.",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2025/11/16/2025_11_16_169043_1763253536._large.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 06:58:15.167591

At the heart of this revolution lie critical battery metals—lithium, cobalt, and nickel—whose strategic importance has skyrocketed, igniting a new ""gold rush"" that is reshaping global supply chains, geopolitical alliances, and the future of industrial development. This renewed focus on securing these vital resources comes with immediate implications for market stability, technological innovation, and national security, as the world races to electrify its future.

The immediate implications are multifaceted: intense strain on existing supply chains, significant price volatility for these commodities, and a heightened geopolitical competition for control over their extraction and processing. While the long-term demand outlook remains robust, the market is navigating a complex period marked by temporary oversupply in some segments, coupled with the immense challenge of scaling up production and refining capacities to meet future exponential growth. This dynamic environment is compelling governments and corporations alike to re-evaluate their strategies, seeking to build more resilient, diversified, and sustainable pathways for these essential materials.

The Electrification Imperative: A Deep Dive into Battery Metal Dynamics

The driving force behind the renewed emphasis on battery metals is the explosive growth of the electric vehicle market and the broader energy transition. Global EV sales surged by 25% in 2024, reaching 17 million units, and are projected to account for 22.6% of total light-vehicle sales worldwide by 2025, climbing to nearly 70% by 2035. This exponential growth directly translates into an insatiable demand for lithium-ion batteries, which in turn necessitates vast quantities of lithium, cobalt, and nickel. A typical EV, for instance, requires approximately eight kilograms of lithium, dwarfing the needs of consumer electronics.

This demand surge has unfolded over a critical timeline:

Mid-2010s Onwards: China aggressively invested across the entire battery supply chain, rapidly expanding its battery production capabilities and raw material supply chains, establishing a dominant position.

2020-2022: Price Surges and Supply Shocks: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed supply chain vulnerabilities, leading to global lithium prices surging over 500% from 2021 to 2022. Nickel prices spiked by 250% in early 2022, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, notably the Russia-Ukraine war.

2022 Onwards: Policy Interventions: Western governments responded with significant policy initiatives. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced tax credits for EVs with batteries sourced from domestic or free-trade partners, while the European Critical Raw Materials Act aims to foster domestic production.

2023-2024: Market Stabilization and Short-Term Oversupply: A period of oversupply and slower-than-expected EV demand growth in some regions led to significant price declines for lithium and nickel. However, some prices have shown signs of rebounding in early 2025, with forecasts of a substantial lithium recovery by 2026.

Key players across the battery metal supply chain include:

Miners: Australia (48% of lithium extraction), Chile (31%), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC, 70% of cobalt production) dominate raw material extraction. Notable public companies include Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), SQM (NYSE: SQM), BHP Group Limited (NYSE: BHP), and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO).

Refiners and Processors: China holds an overwhelming dominance, controlling over half of global lithium, cobalt, and graphite refining capabilities, and 70% of global battery manufacturing capacity.

EV Manufacturers and Battery Cell Producers: Leading battery manufacturers include Chinese giants Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited (CATL) (SHE: 300750) and BYD (OTCPK: BYDDF), alongside South Korean (e.g., LG Chem (KRX: 051910), Samsung SDI (KRX: 006400)) and Japanese (e.g., Panasonic (OTCPK: PCRFY)) producers. Major EV manufacturers like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Mercedes-Benz Group AG (OTCPK: MBGAF) are actively securing supplies.

Initial market reactions have been characterized by extreme price volatility, a surge in investment and M&A activity to secure resources, and a clear prioritization of battery metals as national security interests by governments worldwide. The supply chain remains highly vulnerable due to geographic concentration, geopolitical instability, long lead times for new projects, and persistent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns, particularly in regions like the DRC. Efforts to secure resources include diversification of sourcing, domestic production incentives, direct offtake agreements, strategic stockpiling, and significant investment in recycling and alternative battery chemistries.

Winners and Losers in the Battery Metal Race

The volatile yet high-growth environment for battery metals presents a mixed bag for public companies, creating distinct winners and losers across the mining, EV manufacturing, and battery production sectors.

Mining Companies:

Potential Winners: Miners with low-cost operations, diversified portfolios, and long-term supply agreements are best positioned. Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), the world's largest lithium company, benefits from its scale and strategic contracts, aiming to triple its production by 2030. SQM (NYSE: SQM), the second-largest, recently reported a rebound in profits driven by strong lithium demand. Diversified giants like BHP Group Limited (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO) are pivoting towards renewable-focused metals, including nickel and lithium, strengthening their long-term prospects.

Potential Losers: Many producers, particularly those with higher operating costs or significant exposure to the recent price downturn, have faced substantial financial pressure. Australian nickel producers, for instance, have ceased operations due to fierce competition, particularly from Indonesian supply. Companies like Tianqi Lithium (SHE: 002466) issued profit warnings in early 2024 due to falling lithium prices. The recent market oversupply has forced unprofitable miners to implement drastic cost-cutting measures and delay or cancel projects, impacting future supply growth.

EV Manufacturers:

Potential Winners: EV manufacturers generally benefit from the increased availability and, critically, the recent lower prices of battery metals, which reduce their production costs. This allows them to either improve profit margins or lower vehicle prices, boosting competitiveness and sales. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM), and Mercedes-Benz Group AG (OTCPK: MBGAF) are actively working to stabilize their supply chains through direct investments and long-term agreements. They are also investing in battery chemistry innovations, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, to reduce reliance on more expensive or ethically contentious metals.

Potential Losers: While lower prices are currently advantageous, EV makers who fail to secure diverse and sustainable long-term raw material sources risk future supply bottlenecks and competitive disadvantages when demand eventually outstrips current supply. Over-reliance on specific metals from geopolitically unstable regions (e.g., cobalt from the DRC) can lead to reputational damage and supply restrictions.

Battery Producers:

Potential Winners: Major battery producers like Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited (CATL) (SHE: 300750), LG Energy Solution (KRX: 373220), Panasonic (OTCPK: PCRFY), and Samsung SDI (KRX: 006400) are in a strong position as lower metal costs translate to reduced production expenses. This facilitates the rapid scale-up of ""gigafactories"" to meet projected demand. Companies like FREYR Battery, Inc. (NYSE: FREY) are actively advancing efforts to stabilize the supply chain. These producers are also diversifying battery chemistries, with a clear trend towards LFP batteries, which use less nickel and no cobalt, to balance performance and cost.

Potential Losers: Battery producers can suffer if they fail to manage raw material procurement effectively or are slow to adapt to new battery chemistries or recycling technologies. For instance, POSCO (NYSE: PKX) delayed the completion of its lithium brine project in Argentina until 2026, indicating strategic adjustments due to market volatility. Regulatory changes, such as new EU rules classifying ""black mass"" (recycled battery material) as ""waste,"" can also squeeze margins by restricting exports to non-OECD countries, including China.

Wider Significance: A Geopolitical and Environmental Crossroads

The renewed focus on battery metals transcends mere market dynamics, embedding itself deeply within broader industry trends, geopolitical strategies, and environmental considerations. It signifies a pivotal moment in the global green transition and a new era of resource competition.

This scramble for critical minerals is intrinsically linked to the green transition, as EVs and renewable energy storage are foundational to achieving net-zero emissions. Projections indicate lithium demand could jump by 2,909% with 40% EV adoption by 2050. This reliance on minerals for climate goals has elevated energy security and technological leadership to national priorities. Simultaneously, it fuels intense geopolitical competition. China's commanding position in the processing and refining of critical minerals (e.g., 95% of refined graphite by 2030, 73% of lithium, 59% of cobalt) creates vulnerabilities for Western nations. This dominance is driving market fragmentation and the emergence of parallel supply chains, as countries like the US and EU seek to reduce reliance on concentrated sources and build strategic autonomy.

Ripple effects are widespread. For competitors, navigating fragmented supply chains and volatile prices challenges cost competitiveness and can slow EV adoption. For partners, resource-rich nations (Australia, Chile, DRC, Indonesia, Canada) gain significant leverage, demanding more equitable terms for investment and promoting sustainable development. This fosters new alliances and trade agreements, with automakers increasingly partnering directly with miners to secure long-term supplies.

Regulatory and policy implications are profound:

Subsidies and Incentives: Governments, particularly in the US (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, Defense Production Act) and Europe (Critical Raw Materials Act), are pouring billions into domestic critical mineral production, processing, and recycling to de-risk supply chains and foster regional ecosystems.

Environmental Regulations: The extraction of battery metals carries significant environmental and social costs, including water pollution, habitat destruction, and human rights abuses (e.g., child labor in DRC cobalt mines). Policies are emerging to promote sustainable mining practices, enhance transparency, and boost recycling rates. The EU's proposed Battery Regulation, for example, mandates sustainability, end-of-life management, and due diligence obligations for raw material sourcing.

Historically, the current situation draws parallels with past resource booms, exhibiting a ""boom and bust"" cycle characteristic of commodities. However, the scale and strategic nature of the green transition make this distinct. It marks a ""return of state intervention"" in critical mineral supply chains, where national policy frameworks increasingly shape industry activities. The cautionary tale of Zambia's copper mining history, which led to ""sacrifice zones"" with severe environmental degradation, underscores the critical importance of stringent regulations and accountability to prevent repeating past mistakes in the pursuit of battery metals.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Battery Metals

The trajectory of battery metal supply chains and the EV market beyond 2025 will be defined by strategic pivots, technological advancements, and the delicate balance between surging demand and the ability to scale sustainable supply.

In the short-term (up to 2025/2026), the EV market continues its robust expansion, albeit at a more moderate pace than earlier projections. While prices for lithium, graphite, cobalt, and nickel declined in 2023-2024 due to temporary oversupply and inventory adjustments, some metals are showing signs of recovery. Nickel prices have rebounded due to Indonesian export restrictions, and lithium prices are anticipated to recover substantially by 2026, potentially reaching $12,000-$17,000 per tonne. Opportunities lie in the continued EV growth and the strategic pivot by battery manufacturers towards large-scale energy storage systems (ESS) to utilize underused factories. Challenges persist with geopolitical tensions and ongoing price volatility.

The long-term outlook (beyond 2026) is characterized by substantial growth. By 2040, EVs are expected to account for 70% of all new passenger car registrations. Demand for lithium is projected to increase fivefold by 2040, nickel sixfold, and cobalt threefold. Key strategic pivots and developments include:

Diversification of Battery Chemistries: The market is consolidating around Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) chemistries. LFP, with its lower cost and absence of cobalt/nickel, is gaining significant traction.

Advanced Battery Technologies: Solid-state batteries are seen as the ""new gold standard,"" promising longer ranges and improved safety. Sodium-ion batteries represent a potential long-term game-changer, as they eliminate the need for lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese by substituting abundant sodium, fundamentally altering the resource landscape.

Battery Recycling and Circular Economy: Recycling is becoming critical for long-term supply security and environmental sustainability. By 2030, recycling is projected to supply 15% of the nickel, cobalt, and lithium required for new batteries, creating a secure, domestic supply stream.

Vertical Integration and Supply Chain Reshoring: Companies are increasingly investing directly in raw material extraction and refining, and governments are pushing to build domestic and diversified supply chains to reduce reliance on single regions.

Investment in Production Capacity: Despite sufficient geological reserves, the primary challenge is insufficient current extraction and refining capacity. An estimated $500-600 billion in investment globally through 2040 is required for new mining and refining infrastructure.

Potential scenarios for resource availability and pricing range from worst-case scenarios of severe supply crunches and price spikes (due to insufficient investment or geopolitical disruptions), hindering EV adoption, to best-case scenarios of balanced supply and demand through successful scaling of new projects, efficient refining, and significant contributions from recycling. Technological breakthroughs in new battery chemistries could also diversify the resource base and mitigate supply risks. While overall reserves are sufficient, the bottleneck remains in the speed and sustainability of extraction and processing. Prices are expected to remain volatile but will likely experience upward pressure in the long term if supply and recycling efforts do not keep pace with demand.

As part of the deal, Eos is allowed to issue $500 million in notes that investors can convert into stock. The proceeds will go toward buying back past versions of these notes and “general corporate purposes,” according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

The agreement is the result of the Department of Energy modifying a $305 million loan to Eos, according to a spokesperson for the agency.

That loan agreement, entered into in November, is going toward expanding the firm’s main plant in Turtle Creek.

“As part of the Trump administration’s review of the loan portfolio, both parties worked together to enhance the deal,” according to the Energy Department.

”Eos was given the ability to pursue advantageous private market capital as its business grows rapidly, while DOE will gain the ability to share in some of this potential upside through equity value in warrants that eventually can be converted into additional return for the U.S. government.”

Eos did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment.

The firm produces industrial-scale, rechargeable batteries that rely on reactions between zinc and bromine, which the Energy Department touted in a release during the waning days of the Biden administration as valuable for storing excess clean energy.

They’re also used to fuel data centers, perhaps shedding light on why the artificial intelligence-friendly Trump administration remains supportive of Eos, despite its ties to renewables.

President Donald Trump has shown a fondness for these types of deals, with the federal government under his watch taking stakes of 15% in rare earth minerals producer MP Materials and 10% in computer chip maker Intel.

Westinghouse has also entered a profit-sharing deal with the government from the sale of nuclear reactors.

Pennsylvania and Allegheny County economic development agencies got in on the action with Eos last month by pledging a combined $24 million toward growing its operations in Turtle Creek as well as Marshall.

The Turtle Creek facility employs 280 people, a number that will roughly quadruple over the next year or so, according to Eos CEO Joe Mastrangelo. Corporate operations shifting from Edison, New Jersey, to Nova Place in Pittsburgh’s North Shore in the back half of 2026 will bring additional jobs.

Flush with public dollars, the 17-year-old company has finally found itself able to generate substantial revenue. In the third quarter of this year, Eos’ revenues neared $31 million, up from less than $1 million during the same quarter in 2024.

It took a net loss, however, of about $641 million.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/11/9060689_web1_ptr-EOSexpansion006-102225.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 04:59:01.009767

Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency

Lee Michael Zeldin was born in January 1980 in East Meadow, New York. He earned an undergraduate degree in political science from the University at Albany, and later received a Juris Doctor from Albany Law School.

He received an Army ROTC commission as a second lieutenant and served four years in the United States Army, first in the Military Intelligence Corps. He was deployed to Tikrit, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He went on to serve as a prosecutor in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps and as a military magistrate. He transitioned from active duty to the Army Reserve, where he still serves with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

He began the practice of law as an attorney for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, then began a private law practice. Zeldin served four years as a member of the New York Senate. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008 and retained the seat by winning reelection. He ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York.

Zeldin was nominated by President Donald Trump in November 2024 to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Senate confirmed him and he was sworn into office in January 2025.

Zeldin is married to Diana and they have identical twin daughters. He is Jewish; his wife is Mormon.

In the News…

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin spoke about the new definition of “wetlands” that will determine protections for bodies of water from pollution under the Clean Water Act.

Administrator Zeldin stated, “There will be less that will be regulated by the federal government.”

He added, “I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, other landowners, and governments.”

The EPA administrator said, “No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.”

While local production for renewable energy is growing, manufacturers face competition from Asian powerhouses, led by China, that dominate the global solar supply chain with cheaper, mass-produced panels.","BELEM, Brazil, Nov. 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – The message could not have been clearer as protesters carried coffins labeled oil, coal and gas through Belém while negotiators met in the Amazonian city for the United Nations COP30 climate summit.

It may be too early to declare the end of the fossil fuel era, but up to 80 countries are demanding a concrete plan to move away from polluting power at the climate summit.

Along with the political challenge of getting the 195 countries, including oil producers, at COP30 to agree to such a plan, there are practical obstacles to weaning the world off oil and gas, especially as electricity demand is set to soar from the surge in artificial intelligence and population growth.

Although renewable power is expanding fast, the world is not on track to triple clean energy by 2030, a target set at COP28 in Dubai two years ago, when countries agreed for the first time on “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”

And the expansion is not happening quickly enough in the countries that need clean power most.

Developing nations say they require more money to switch to clean power and join the “unstoppable” renewables revolution that could create 8,000 jobs a day over the next decade, said Bruce Douglas, chief executive of the Brussels-based Global Renewables Alliance.

“The gap is getting smaller, (but) we need a significant increase in investment and deployment…. The targets are great, but targets are not turbines and pledges are not panels,” Douglas said in an interview at COP30.

Governments need to put in place ambitious climate plans to give investors confidence in projects that would provide energy-poor citizens with power and cut mortality rates from air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, Douglas said.

“Capital is flowing in record amounts year-on-year, but it’s not happening in those markets that need it most,” Douglas said.

Only about 17% of investment in clean energy goes to developing and emerging economies, he said, with that number falling to about 4% in Africa, where some 620 million people lack stable and affordable access to energy.

Urielle Nsenda, a negotiator for the Democratic Republic of Congo, said developing countries like hers also need technical support to design renewable projects.

“Another problem facing countries in Africa is that we don’t have enough data on the sector to help us identify and build suitable projects for national circumstances,” she said in Belém.

For example, the DRC has significant hydropower energy potential, according to the International Energy Agency, while other African countries are focusing on solar power to boost their renewable capacity.

“The energy transition requires us to adapt our infrastructure,” Nsenda said. “We don’t want to carry the burden alone.”

PRICED OUT

Douglas said finance from richer governments can be used to provide subsidies to communities to invest in solar, and larger-scale projects often require measures to reduce the risk of financial losses and bring down the cost of investments.

“In many cases the perceived risk is higher than the actual risk, so default rates for some of those countries are lower than they are using to price the interest rates,” he said.

Douglas also called for an end to more than $1 trillion of fossil fuel subsidies worldwide and policies to ensure this does not penalize the most vulnerable by exposing them to higher electricity bills.

“So you build the renewables at the same time as you are transitioning away from fossil fuels,” he said.

A draft of a possible deal for the COP30 talks, drawn up by host Brazil, contains a line urging all parties to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.

Developing countries that produce gas, oil and coal are concerned about the effect of the transition on workers and industries as well as on consumers who might face higher costs.

After Nigeria abolished fuel subsidies as part of a package of economic reforms in 2023, petrol prices tripled, driving nationwide protests last year.

Nigeria aims to reduce its dependence on oil and generate 30% of its energy from renewables by 2030 as well as develop local manufacturing capacity.

While local production for renewable energy is growing, manufacturers face competition from Asian powerhouses, led by China, that dominate the global solar supply chain with cheaper, mass-produced panels.

“The developed world must phase out their reliance on fossil fuels fast, while allowing developing countries a longer timeline and the necessary support, like technology and financing, to do the same,” Prince Papa, Africa campaigner for the global Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative (FFNPTI), said ahead of the COP30 talks.

One stumbling block on the path to a global clean energy transition is the stance of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, which has blocked renewable projects at home and is pushing other countries to follow suit.

“There are going to be winners and losers, and the losers may well be those consumers in the United States who could face increased power prices, especially given increased demand from data centers and AI,” he said.

The House on Tuesday voted to overturn a slew of Biden administration land protections through the rule-busting Congressional Review Act.

The House passed S.J. Res. 80 from Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) to ax former President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw millions of acres from production in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve.

Three moderate Democrats — Jim Costa of California, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas — crossed the aisle to vote ""yes.""

The legislation passed the Senate last month with support from Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman and now heads to President Donald Trump.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) said the measure was critical to Alaska’s economic success and in line with congressional intent.

“The Biden administration stymied energy production in the NPR-A and failed to offer leases in a manner that that would boost revenue and provide economic stability to the region and the state,” Westerman said.

Arguing against the resolution was House Natural Resources ranking member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who warned that the Republicans’ CRA strategy was both unnecessary and legally dubious.

""House Republicans are continuing to lock the American people into higher energy costs by pushing their fossil fuel playbook and sabotaging clean, renewable energy,"" Huffman said. ""Our constituents deserve better.""

The Congressional Review Act allows lawmakers to undo newly issued rules by simple majority. Because the last administration did not submit a number of resource plans as rules, it kept them vulnerable to attack from the GOP.

The House also passed H.J. Res. 131, from Rep. Nick Begich (R-Alaska), to repeal the Biden administration’s restrictions in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

“Congress must move to repeal the Biden-era [Record of Decision] that runs counter to congressional intent and unfairly reduces economic opportunities in the region,” Westerman said.

Huffman called the measure the ""latest attack from my Republican colleagues to undercut our public lands, to prop up fossil fuel polluters and the expensive energy sources that they peddle and to leave people out of the decision-making process.”

The same three Democrats voted for the proposal. Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, who often bucks his party on the environment, voted to keep Biden development limits in Alaska.

Rep. Harriet Hageman's H.J. Res. 130 would strike the Bureau of Land Management Buffalo Field Office's latest resource management plan, which sought to severely restrict coal leasing. No Democrat voted in favor. The Senate is poised to approve the legislation this week.

Congress already killed Biden-era resource management plans in Montana, North Dakota and Alaska. The administration is moving to undo other Biden actions on its own.

We’ve just about made it through another hurricane season. But I should warn you that something even scarier is coming: A gubernatorial election.

Board up your windows! Batten down your lawn furniture! The politicians are coming, and they’re blowing Category 5 gusts of hot air!

In 2026, we’re going to elect our next governor, and candidates have been jumping into the race like kids leaping into a cool Florida spring on a scorching summer day. So far, there are four Republicans and two Democrats vying for the job.

The Republicans are Byron Donalds, a U.S. representative from Naples; Paul Renner, a former speaker of the House from the Jacksonville area; little-known Lt. Gov. Jay Collins from Tampa; and James Fishback, a business executive with no government experience whom Politico described as a “fast-talking, Spanish-speaking Davie, Florida, native.”

On the Democratic side, the competitors are former Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly, now pursuing the Charlie Crist party-switch path; and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, a former police chief and sheriff.

As if those six weren’t enough, there’s an independent candidate, Miami Sen. Jason Pizzo, a former Democrat who’s announced he’s running, too.

Generally speaking, seeing seven candidates seeking the Governor’s Mansion could be a sign of how big a disaster the sitting occupant has been.

The Ron DeSantis administration is being investigated by a Leon County grand jury in the Hope Florida scandal. He’s under scrutiny for voting to give $83 million to a campaign contributor in exchange for 4 acres of Destin land nobody wanted. His proposal to build golf courses in a state park last year was so deeply unpopular that the Legislature passed a law this year to prevent him or his successors from ever trying to do it again.

Note that two of the three episodes involve DeSantis’ horrible handling of environmental issues. That’s why, I think, every chance we get in the next 12 months, we voters ought to quiz his would-be replacements about where they stand on that segment of the state’s responsibilities.

As we have seen repeatedly, the environment in Florida IS the economy. The two are as inextricably intertwined as the tangled roots of a mangrove forest.

Dirty water

When DeSantis was first elected in 2018, Florida voters were concerned about toxic algae blooms that had lasted for months. DeSantis swore he’d cure this by appointing a panel of scientists to tell him about what to do.

He appointed the panel — but then he and the Legislature failed to follow most of its recommendations.

Now Florida is the No. 1 state for polluted lakes. A toxic algae bloom killed off so much seagrass in the Indian River Lagoon that more than 1,000 manatees starved to death. Florida’s longest river, the St. Johns, is coping with steadily increasing pollution from septic waste.

Even when the Legislature passed a law ordering special protections for our iconic springs, the agencies answering to DeSantis ignored it, noted Grant Gelhardt of the Sierra Club.

Instead of attacking pollution sources, DeSantis cut a deal to pay millions of dollars to an Israeli company that dumps a hydrogen peroxide mix into algae-tainted waterways. But then the algae comes back and the Israelis have to do it over. Even the head of the Israeli company thinks this is futile.

“DeSantis’ fight against algal blooms in Florida will fail,” he wrote on X, back when it was just plain Twitter. “There is no question that preventing raw sewage and runoffs from spilling into waterways must be addressed.”

So, the first question everyone should ask the gubernatorial candidates is: What will you do to fix Florida’s rampant water pollution problems?

Lake O woes

I had a lengthy chat about this with Gil Smart of the Vote Water organization, who pointed out that Lake Okeechobee in particular needs help.

It was recently named the dirtiest lake in the U.S. Things have gotten so bad there that Bass Masters removed Lake O from its Top Ten Bass Lakes in the United States.

Rather than clamp down on polluters poisoning Lake O and other waterways, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has set up a series of voluntary “basin management action plans” that all fail, Smart said.

“That’s the state’s main tool for reducing pollution and it’s not working,” he said. “At what point do we stop saying, ‘Oh, that’s a shame,’ and start doing something about it?”

The polluters tend to be big campaign contributors, which guarantees they’re left alone. But the pollution is taking an economic toll on our tourism, fishing, and other industries, so whoever takes over from DeSantis will need to make some hard choices.

Last year, Donalds convened a water summit that matched polluters with regulators — and refused to allow in either the press or the public. If he opened the meeting to everyone, Donalds argued, the poor polluters and the people regulating them would be too scared to talk honestly.

To me, “honest talk” between polluters and regulators is less important than letting the public — the people paying the tax bills and drinking the water —- know what’s going on.

But that leads to our second question for the candidates.

On the downlow

DeSantis clearly missed his calling. Instead of politics, he should’ve gone into espionage.

He persuaded the Legislature to make his travel records a state secret, even though no governor ever sought such a Sunshine Law exemption. He held a Cabinet meeting in a foreign country, ensuring most Floridians couldn’t participate. Even worse, he’s repeatedly cut non-public deals to give away public land to private interests.

First came his attempt to allow a company to build three golf courses in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, plus hotels and pickleball courts in other parks. That blew up in his face like a hand grenade.

Then he attempted to swap land from the Withlacoochee State Forest with a Canadian golf course builder. An uproar ensued and the land went unswapped.

More recently, he wanted to give some mystery developer 600 acres from the Guana River Wildlife Management Area. Once the public found out, the developer melted back into the shadows.

Each instance of DeSantis trying to keep things on the downlow led to widespread outrage. People love Florida’s preserves, and they don’t like seeing some ploy to give them away.

That’s why I think the next question for the candidates has to be: Will you treat public land like it’s owned by the public, and not as your personal property to benefit friends?

We want to return to the days when our precious state parks, preserves,, and forests stayed public and stayed natural.

This leads to the one area where DeSantis almost came across as a good guy.

Undermining the Everglades

For 25 years, when Florida politicians wanted to fool the voters into thinking they liked the environment, they talked about restoring the Everglades.

“I pledge to spend millions on restoration of the River of Grass,” they’d promise solemnly. What they really meant was, “I’ll hand over millions in tax dollars to well-connected contractors to build what the plans call for, but I won’t do it fast and they’ll take their time, too.”

That’s why the Everglades restoration has gone billions over budget and years beyond its original deadline.

But not even the most cynical would have built a new pollution source like an immigrant detention camp in the Big Cypress National Preserve. That would undercut all the restoration work that’s already been done.

Yet DeSantis did it, and without even checking its environmental impact.

Environmental groups accused him of betraying the Glades. But DeSantis scoffed at being considered an Everglades villain, considering all the money he’d steered toward the River of Grass.

“You’re talking about the guy who’s plowed how much money into Everglades restoration?” DeSantis said.

That’s sort of like him saying, “I’ve spent a lot of money on a fancy car, so you should respect my automotive expertise — even though I’ve just dumped a bag of sugar in the gas tank.”

Lawsuits are working their way through federal court to shut this camp down.

I contacted one of the plaintiffs: Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, the organization co-founded by Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I asked her what she would ask the candidates to replace DeSantis. Her answer:

“Will you commit to banning all harmful development from the Everglades that undermines the billion-dollar restoration project?”

That should cover not only the prison camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” she said, but also a rock mine being pushed by Big Sugar and various residential and commercial developments that have been steadily chomping away at the margins.

“You can’t be an Everglades governor and allow development in the Everglades,” she said.

Which leads to the next question.

Developer-Santis

DeSantis has never met a developer he didn’t like. He’s signed every bill they supported. He’s backed controversial developments so often, I started calling him “Developer-Santis.”

Did the developers want expensive toll roads to spread urban sprawl throughout rural areas? Despite widespread objections, DeSantis said yes to that.

Even when a project would make hurricane evacuation much worse, he didn’t support saving the lives of Floridians. Instead, he voted to say yes to the developer.

And if any local government failed to kowtow to developers, he’s been eager to force them into compliance.’

The result of putting the developers in the driver’s seat is that growth is careening out of control, leaving our sewer systems overloaded, our water systems running dry and our roads crowded and crumbling.

Lots of Floridians are becoming fed up with this unwavering governmental support of sprawl-over-all. They want a change. That’s especially true in our remaining rural areas, where people like living at a slower pace.

So, the next question I would ask the candidates is: Will you stand up to developers and tell them no? Will you stick up for saving some parts of Florida as rural? Will you commit to keeping these slices of paradise the way they are?

If they do it even once, that’s better than DeSantis.

Last but not least, let’s talk about science.

The anti-scientist

While I was talking to Gerhardt of the Sierra Club, he told me, “Science should be in the forefront of any plan to protect Florida’s resources.” Who could argue with that?

Our governor would. In the future, DeSantis will be remembered as the most virulently anti-science governor ever.

During the pandemic, he became such a contrarian to the medical establishment that he actually scolded teenagers for wearing masks .

He’s also appointed people who were anti-science, like an anti-vaxxer surgeon general. And consider his wildlife commissioners, who are so eager to shoot bears that they ignored that the science shows the bear population has declined.

He was cool with signing a new law based on the thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory about “chemtrails.” Meanwhile, even though signs of climate change are obvious everywhere in Florida, he approved legislation to remove that term from most of state law. He had the full support of Speaker Renner on that one, by the way.

Surprisingly, ignoring climate change does not make it go away. We will continue facing soaring temperatures and rising sea levels that affect everything from the intensity of hurricanes to the frequency of expensive beach renourishment.

So, I think it’s fair to ask the candidates if they believe in following what science says about solutions. Or would they prefer Florida continue relying on folk tales, internet rumors, and ancient superstitions?

I think we need to pin these guys down now. Otherwise, they’re liable to try try to top DeSantis.

Cynthia Giles was the senate-confirmed head of U.S. EPA enforcement during the Obama administration and a senior advisor at the Biden EPA.","EPA didn’t get the memo. President Trump has been loudly pushing his vision for U.S. energy dominance, which includes increasing U.S. oil and gas exports. But the Trump EPA is cutting the legs out from under U.S. oil and gas competitiveness in international markets.

I was the senate-confirmed head of enforcement in the Obama EPA and a Senior Advisor in the Biden EPA, deeply involved in the Biden environmental rules for U.S. oil and gas. So I am an unlikely person to be helping the President by sending a warning: EPA is putting your energy dominance agenda at risk. This is the moment to intervene because EPA action is expected any day.

The engine for U.S. sales of oil and gas overseas is the strength of U.S. rules that position U.S. oil and gas to become the cleanest in the world. A growing number of countries want to buy oil and gas that has cut avoidable emissions and can prove it. The EU has methane restrictions on the books, and many other large fuel-purchasing countries are teed up to follow suit.

Importing countries want oil and gas that hit three key benchmarks: reduced emissions from production and distribution, a robust system to curtail super-emitters – which are responsible for as much as 50% of emissions – and reliable monitoring and reporting so emission claims can be verified. That’s what EU rules require, and what other big importing countries are quickly moving toward.

Fortunately for U.S. oil and gas companies, the U.S. already has such a program. It’s set forth in the 2024 methane rule and in EPA’s reporting program. While the motivation of the U.S. rules wasn’t primarily to promote exports, that’s their effect, because they address the requirements of importing countries, backed by the credibility of U.S. government oversight.

The driver for U.S. oil and gas supremacy is already built; all the Trump EPA has to do is get out of the way.

Despite these rules’ alignment with the President’s energy dominance agenda, EPA plans to delay both, one for as long as a decade. EPA Administrator Zeldin claims that gutting these rules is good for the U.S. oil and gas industry. That is exactly wrong. These rules are what positions U.S. oil and gas producers to be the strongest competitors in the world.

Industry experts concur. An S&P Global analysis finding that growth of LNG exports is expected to add $1.3 trillion to the U.S. economy through 2040 states: “Continued focus on methane reduction throughout the U.S. LNG supply chain will be critical to maintaining a competitive advantage for U.S. LNG in markets that have implemented or are considering implementing methane caps or carbon tariffs on LNG imports, such as Japan and South Korea.” A University of Texas Center for Energy and Environmental Systems Analysis report is more pointed: “Data transparency enhances competitiveness and market access for U.S. oil and gas exports. Substantially weakening emissions data collection would harm rather than help U.S. companies.”

EPA told the EU in 2024 that U.S. oil and gas exports should qualify for an equivalence determination under the EU requirements, exempting U.S. products from most import requirements. The flip side is also true: without the 2024 U.S. rules, an equivalence determination cannot be justified. This difference is night and day for U.S. exporters. An exemption will catapult U.S. oil and gas to the top of the most-desired list. Whereas the EPA proposal to stop reporting “completely shoots a hole” in the request for equivalence.

Industry explained all of this to EPA before it proposed to set aside the rules that give U.S. industry a huge advantage over foreign competitors. Industry leaders don’t want these roll-backs because they can count; the rules’ modest compliance costs are a drop in the bucket compared to hundreds of billions in revenues from exports.

President Trump can get what he wants for U.S. oil and gas exports. Administrator Zeldin just has to leave the reporting rule alone and reactivate the delayed methane rule. With those two rules in place, the U.S. could satisfy the importing countries’ requirements and become the world’s most attractive trading partner.

If that doesn’t happen, and EPA continues to throw a wrench in the works for U.S. energy dominance – likely reducing, rather than boosting, U.S. exports – then the White House can’t say they weren’t warned.

(AP) — The Trump administration has once again extended the life of a Michigan coal-fired power plant that was supposed to close last May as the utility Consumers Energy transitions to cleaner sources of electricity.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan's attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

The U.S. Department of Energy argues parts of the Midwest are facing an energy emergency, and that the J.H. Campbell coal-fired plant’s power would help keep costs low.

Consumers Energy, which operates the plant, had planned to shut it down in May — an early decommissioning the company said was aimed at reducing costs for customers, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and moving toward natural gas and renewable energy sources.

In a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright alleged work taken to shut down coal-burning plants in favor of natural gas and renewable power created an energy shortage.

“The Trump administration will keep taking action to reverse these energy subtraction policies, lowering energy costs and minimizing the risks of blackouts. Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable and secure energy regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, especially in dangerously cold weather,” Wright said in the statement.

This is now the third time Wright ordered the Campbell plant to stay open.

The last two orders also claimed emergency conditions required the plant to stay open. The most recent one would have expired on Wednesday.

Environmental groups and Michigan's state utility regulator have pushed back against the Trump administration’s reasoning to keep the plant open longer.

Michigan League of Conservation Voters spokesperson Nick Dodge said Campbell’s closure doesn’t create any emergency.

“It’s unnecessary, and there have already been plans and additional generation put in place through renewables and in natural gas to fulfill all the energy needs that Campbell provides,” Dodge said.

He also raised concerns about threats to the environment along the Lake Michigan shoreline where the coal-burning plant sits. Regarding the reasoning that Wednesday’s order was a cost-saving measure, Dodge said it would have been cheaper to let the plant close.

“It was supposed to save us $600 million … through 2040. And that was due to the plant being so inefficient and expensive to operate. So, all of that is out the window now with the plant being forced to stay open,” Dodge said.

Consumers Energy, Michigan’s second-largest utility, announced plans to close the Campbell plant back in 2021. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved the plan in 2022.

A webpage detailing steps in the closure said it would make Consumers, “a cleaner, leaner and flexible energy company.”

Company spokesperson Katie Carey provided the following statement responding to Thursday’s order to keep the plant open.

“Consumers Energy is prepared to continue operating the Campbell plant as required by the U.S. Department of Energy. Consistent with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order, the costs to operate the Campbell plant will be shared by customers across the Midwest electric grid region – not solely by Consumers Energy customers. We are planning to submit a cost recovery filing to FERC later this year outlining net costs to operate the plant during the first 90 days.”

Michigan shares a power grid with all or part of 14 other states and one Canadian province. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., or MISO, oversees that regional system.

In a written statement, MISO said it will work with Consumers Energy to ensure order compliance.

“MISO remains focused on reliably operating the grid using the resources our members provide, while working closely with stakeholders and regulatory partners,” the statement from MISO media relations advisor McKenzie Barbknecht read.

The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of the Army’s proposed changes have heightened worry among conservation groups that federal protections for isolated wetlands might be weakened further than they were soon after the 2023 Supreme Court decision that found wetlands must be connected by surface water to a navigable body of water to fall under the 1972 Clean Water Act.

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers said in a release Monday that the newly proposed changes are to “fully implement the court’s direction by focusing on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes—and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies.”

As part of the announcement, leadership posted the prepublication notice they planned to submit to the Federal Register. Once published there, a 45-day public comment period would open.

Language in the Clean Water Act states that the “term ‘navigable waters’ means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” However, the act doesn’t define what “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, actually are, leaving the EPA and Corps to determine the geographic scope of the rule.

Over the last five decades, pushback and litigation have forced the two agencies to revise the definition several times.

The current regulatory definition, according to the EPA, was put in place in September 2023 to align with the May 2023 Supreme Court ruling on the Sackett v EPA lawsuit.

The Sacketts filed the lawsuit after the agency ordered the Idaho couple to restore where they had begun backfilling with dirt the section of their property that the EPA considered to be wetlands of a nearby navigable waterbody. The judges sided with the Sacketts that federally protected wetlands must have an obvious connection to waterbodies like streams, oceans, rivers and lakes.

To conform to the Sackett decision, the EPA and Army amended in September 2023 the latest final rule, which had been put in place that January.

EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle shared with Washington, D.C., lawmakers Monday afternoon an overview of the proposed rules.

“I know that across the country, news of today’s proposal is going to be met with a lot of relief and happiness from farmers, ranchers, other landowners, governments that have been looking for a simple, prescriptive definition that the whole country can operate off of, and would allow individuals to know whether or not there’s a ‘water of the United States’ without having to go hire an attorney or a consultant, having to pay someone to Tell them,” Zeldin said Monday during the announcement livestreamed on the EPA’s YouTube.

The EPA secretary explained that the proposal “includes practical, common-sense revisions that will make a real difference,” and adds definitions for what he called “key terms” such as “’relatively permanent,’ ‘continuous surface connection’ and ‘tributary’ to appropriately limit the scope of what is consistent with” the Sackett case.

“We’re establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters, either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow. We’re adding a new exclusion for groundwater and revising exclusions for certain ditches prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems,” Zeldin continued. “We’re incorporating locally familiar terminology such as wet season to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS. And we’re strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources.”

He explained that the proposed rules were developed based on input from multiple sources, including preproposal recommendations, docket information from nine public listening sessions and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Telle addressed the audience after Zeldin.

“Since 1972 Americans have struggled to understand what Congress meant when it included the term ‘waters of the United States’ in the Clean Water Act. Did it apply to them? Did it not? The definition of that term has been often abused, sometimes stretched beyond recognition over time, and it’s left Americans uncertain about whether they were complying with the Clean Water Act or not,” he said Monday, adding that “under President Trump’s leadership, the EPA and army Civil Works, which oversees the Corps of Engineers, are kicking off the formal process that will give American certainty about their property once and for all.”

Several Republican officials thanked Zeldin from the podium for initiating the proposed amendments including West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey who said that “for too long there’s been great deal of uncertainty” about the WOTUS rule.

“Unfortunately, it left many people holding the bag. Farmers, contractors, small business owners guessing whether their ephemeral stream or a backyard ditch was going to be classified as a waters of the United States rule and potentially subject them to significant penalties,” he continued.

Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer said he was confident that the rule will prioritize clean water while protecting farmers, ranchers, landowners and businesses alike.

Conservation groups have been vocal about these revisions opening up isolated wetlands to development and degradation since the announcement was made.

“Wetlands are the lifeblood of our coast, and should be held to the highest standards of protection,” North Carolina Coastal Federation Coastal Advocate Kerri Allen explained. “The wetlands most impacted by these proposed rollbacks are the very wetlands that hold water during storms and help protect downstream waters. With the proposed changes, our coast will face irrevocable damage that impacts not only our wildlife and fisheries, but also our coastal economy and communities.” The Coastal Federation publishes Coastal Review.

Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Mark Sabath said Monday in a statement that this proposed rule, if adopted, “could have catastrophic ramifications for communities already plagued by flooding, water quality concerns, and drinking water shortages. After critical, longstanding protections for clean water and wetlands were drastically narrowed by the Sackett decision, we need stronger protections, not weaker, to safeguard our communities and environment.”

League of Conservation Voters Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote had a similar reaction.

“The Trump administration’s Polluted Water Rule is another blatant giveaway to big corporate polluters that will jeopardize the waters that our families and communities rely on for drinking, recreation, and fueling our local economies,” Foote said.

“In 2023, the Supreme Court’s devastating Sackett decision stripped federal protections from millions of miles of streams and tens of millions of acres of wetlands, and now corporate polluters are pushing their friends in the administration to go even further in decimating our clean water safeguards. They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon,” Foote continued.

Environmental Defense Fund Associate Vice President Will McDow stated Monday that the new proposed WOTUS rule from the Trump administration that will redefine which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act Protections.",https://coastalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/boiling-spring-lakes-preserve.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 03:58:12.926804

Indonesia will require an estimated Rp 3,000 trillion ($179 billion) in investment to achieve full reliance on electricity sourced from renewable energy, according to the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry.

Jisman Hutajulu, Expert Staff for Strategic Planning at the ministry, said the required capital covers major infrastructure components, including power plant construction, substations, transmission lines, distribution networks, and other supporting systems.

“It will take roughly Rp 3,000 trillion in investment -- this is a very large figure. We are calling on all stakeholders to work hand in hand,” Jisman said in Jakarta on Wednesday.

The push toward clean electricity is considered crucial given Indonesia’s vast renewable-energy potential, estimated at 3,500 gigawatts, and its environmental advantages over fossil fuel–based generation.

Jisman noted that the ministry plans to maximize renewable-energy capacity across the country, reflecting the targets outlined in State Utility PLN’s Electricity Supply Business Plan for 2025–2034.

Under the roadmap, Indonesia aims to add 69.5 gigawatts of new power generation capacity, 47,758 circuit-kilometers of transmission infrastructure, and 107,950 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of substations.

Of the total planned 69.5 gigawatt increase, clean-energy sources will play a dominant role with the following breakdown:

76 percent, equivalent to 52.9 gigawatts, will come from renewable energy and energy-storage systems.

Energy-storage systems will supply 10.3 gigawatts, equal to 15 percent.

The remaining 16.6 gigawatts, or 24 percent, will come from fossil-fuel-based power plants.

The ministry emphasizes that broad collaboration -- including government, state utilities, financiers, and the private sector -- will be critical to closing the funding gap needed to realize Indonesia’s clean-energy transition.

While the defense and economic implications of the pledged deals will take center stage, the civilian nuclear agreement will not only influence Saudi Arabia’s economic development but also the strength and direction of the U.S. nuclear industry.

Key details about the deal have yet to be publicized, but the signed “Joint Declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation” is a further step towards finalizing a 123 agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Agreements under section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act govern the transfer of U.S. civilian nuclear technology, equipment, and materials to foreign countries. These agreements require Congressional approval and are mandatory for American civilian nuclear technology to be exported.

Those opposed to a 123 agreement with the Saudis have raised the risk that a civilian nuclear program would pave the way for Saudi Arabia to acquire a nuclear weapon. Others have argued that a Saudi civilian nuclear program would also push Iran to complete the final steps to build a nuclear warhead.

But, the claim that a U.S-Saudi civilian nuclear deal is an accelerator to proliferation lacks credibility. By signing the Joint Declaration with the United States, Saudi Arabia is voluntarily opening their entire nuclear sector to American nonproliferation standards and international scrutiny; which would otherwise be lacking under a deal with another country. An agreement with the U.S. limits the possibility of turning civilian-grade nuclear materials into weapons because sensitive processes like enrichment and reprocessing are frequently checked, and can even be excluded if agreed upon by the parties.

Ultimately, inking a civilian nuclear deal that would see the United States export reactor technology to Saudi Arabia would be a boon for a U.S. nuclear industry that has been dominated by Russia in the global export market. Exporting reactors to Saudi Arabia would provide the industry with opportunities for more learning-by-doing, which can reduce overall costs of reactor construction and help to expedite domestic deployment of advanced reactors.

A Nuclear Deal Was a Long Time Coming

For more than a decade, Saudi officials have signaled that they view nuclear energy as central to the country’s economic diversification and long-term strategic positioning.

In President Trump’s first term, his administration pursued a deal to share U.S. nuclear technology with Saudi Arabia, allowing preliminary work on nuclear power as a precursor to a final nuclear cooperation agreement. Those efforts ultimately stalled when the Biden administration refrained from finalizing a deal with Saudi Arabia.

Given the Trump administration’s interest in exporting more nuclear technologies and competing for the global nuclear reactor market, the deal with Saudi Arabia should not be surprising. In May, President Trump signed a quartet of executive orders to spur the American nuclear industry. Notably, Executive Order 14299, Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security, acknowledged the importance of nuclear energy in American foreign policy and national security. The order specifically directs the Secretary of State to aggressively promote American nuclear exports through diplomatic engagement and negotiation of 123 Agreements.

Early in 2025, the Trump administration and Saudi officials hinted at revived talks on a possible 123 agreement, but no announcements were made and further negotiations were not publicized. Last night’s agreement is just the next step in that process. According to a White House fact sheet, the deal “builds the legal foundation for a decades-long, multi-billion-dollar nuclear energy partnership with the Kingdom; confirms that the United States and American companies will be the Kingdom’s civil nuclear cooperation partners of choice; and ensures that all cooperation will be conducted in a manner consistent with strong nonproliferation standards.”

With the Joint Declaration now complete, all that is left is finalizing the formal agreement under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act.

What Does the Deal Mean for U.S. Nuclear?

A civilian nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia materially strengthens the American nuclear industry at a moment when global demand for new reactors is rising and international competitors, particularly Russia and China, are moving aggressively to capture emerging markets.

For U.S. reactor developers, the most immediate benefit is simple: reactor orders. The American nuclear sector has spent decades without new large-scale international customers, leaving companies trapped in a cycle where limited deployment constrains learning, which in turn keeps costs high and timelines long. A Saudi project, likely involving multiple reactors, would provide exactly the kind of operational learning that historically drives down costs and accelerates commercialization. A similar dynamic is already visible next door in the UAE, where the Barakah project—facilitated by the U.S.-UAE 123 Agreement—has shown how early reactor orders can build competence, reduce costs, and reinforce long-term industrial capability.

Saudi Arabia also has the capital to finance first- to nth-of-a-kind reactors, which can allow designs to move down the cost curve and become globally competitive. In the United States, utilities are structurally risk-averse when it comes to projects with very high upfront capital costs, whether it’s large gigawatt-scale plants or next-generation SMRs. American utility business models reward cost certainty, not technological ambition, and they face regulators who are understandably cautious about saddling ratepayers with multi-billion-dollar construction risks. As a result, many U.S. reactor developers find themselves trapped in a catch-22: they cannot achieve lower costs without deployment, but they cannot achieve deployment without lower costs. Foreign orders can break that cycle.

With the fiscal capacity and political will to finance early builds, Saudi Arabia can provide the market demand that allows U.S. designs to demonstrate performance, achieve serial production, and reduce costs through improved efficiency. A Saudi orderbook would help build up the U.S. nuclear supply chain. But, while a 123 agreement creates the legal pathway for U.S. exports, it does not dictate when or where the first reactors would be built. While the Trump administration could push for an early domestic success, Saudi Arabia could move more quickly than American utilities constrained by capital costs and regulatory risk. Ultimately, the combination of domestic and foreign demand is what rebuilds an industry that has gone decades without either. Multiple reactor projects create predictable, multi-year demand for steel, forgings, instrumentation and control systems, construction labor, and fuel production. That stability allows suppliers to scale, modernize, and invest while developers and end users are able to point to firm partnerships, projects, and prices.

Beyond the industrial benefits on U.S. soil, the Saudi nuclear partnership would strengthen America’s competitive position in a global market dominated by state-backed rivals. Russia, through Rosatom, is currently the dominant exporter of nuclear reactors, with major multi-reactor projects underway in Turkey, Egypt, and other countries. Such agreements guarantee long-term fuel, servicing, and financing packages that bind partner countries to Moscow for decades. China is moving in the same direction. Every country that opts for Russian or Chinese reactor technology creates a 100-year relationship between them. As global demand accelerates, the countries that show up with competitive offers will shape the next generation of nuclear markets.

The Deal Is Also a Win for Nonproliferation

Saudi Arabia was going to pursue a civilian nuclear program with or without the United States. Even with the agreement signed, Saudi Arabia can still buy reactors from the French, the Koreans, or maybe even the Chinese. And whether they signed or not, the Saudis could easily buy enrichment technology from the same place that Libya, Iran, and North Korea did: Pakistan.

That has been the largest sticking point over a deal with Saudi Arabia. But explicitly waiving enrichment and reprocessing technology is not necessary for a 123 agreement—it’s only been a stipulation in one previous agreement. The United States’ approach to nuclear cooperation agreements and nonproliferation standards has been steadfast. No matter the specific stipulations agreed to across different 123 Agreements, transparency and oversight to another country’s nuclear operation is demanded by any American 123 agreement. Not to mention, international oversight and safeguards have only improved since the U.S. started exporting civilian nuclear technology. Saudi Arabia has, after over a decade of negotiation, arrived at the signing table knowing the United States’ position on nonproliferation—suggesting the Saudi’s intent to uphold the deal.

The joint agreement signed yesterday gives the United States a role in setting conditions, imposing oversight, or influencing the direction of a Saudi nuclear program. Cooperation provides an opportunity to shape nuclear development toward transparent, peaceful use in the Gulf. Blocking engagement would not have eliminated Saudi Arabia’s long term strategic calculations; it would have only limited America’s visibility and leverage.

A U.S. 123 agreement will require Saudi Arabia to accept more stringent international safeguards and will produce a more transparent program than if Saudi Arabia had partnered with China or Russia. Those alternatives would have likely involved less rigorous oversight and higher proliferation risks, not to mention, a loss for U.S. industry.

Saudi Arabia values its links to the United States and has repeatedly signaled a preference for American nuclear technology. Riyadh likes the credibility and prestige that comes with U.S. partnerships. Building nuclear bombs while having U.S. reactor technology within a negotiated nonproliferation framework would have a very steep cost and would be technically difficult. And, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s comments suggest that if Saudi Arabia ever pursued a weapon, it would be a political decision, and it would not begin with a transparent, heavily monitored civilian nuclear program.

Crossing the T’s and Dotting the I’s

The “Joint Declaration on the Completion of Negotiations on Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation,” secures a U.S. role in the growth and development of Saudi Arabia’s nuclear future. It preserves U.S. influence in the region and allows for the safeguarding of nuclear technologies. It also is the next step towards a new market for U.S. reactor developers who need reactor orders to secure financing, improve efficiency, and lower costs for the U.S. domestic market.

Next to come is the finalized and signed 123 Agreement, which President Trump will then send to Congress for review. The details of the agreement will carry enormous weight, setting the terms under which the United States can maintain influence, ensure transparency, and keep the program firmly within peaceful bounds. A well-crafted 123 agreement should build in safeguards, including prohibitions on reprocessing spent fuel, robust verification measures, and close cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. It should also defer sensitive issues, such as domestic enrichment, until a future date or create an alternative mechanism, providing flexibility while keeping concerns in check.

Whether Saudi reactor orders materialize immediately or take shape over several years, the agreement gives American developers access to a new market with energy demands and plenty of capital—both of which are key to making the American nuclear industry competitive again.",https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Riyadh.jpeg?mtime=1763588435,N,,2025-11-20 11:04:53.552835

EPA Region 6 led the response to the Smitty’s Supply fire in Roseland, Louisiana, to remove over 11 million gallons of waste from the Tangipahoa River and surrounding waterways and engage with over 3,000 residents. Region 6 also issued a Safe Drinking Water Act permit for ExxonMobil’s Rose Low Carbon Solutions Class VI injection wells in Jefferson County and a Clean Air Act permit to Texas GulfLink for a deepwater port southeast of Freeport. These permits enable significant projects to move forward, creating jobs and boosting the nation’s energy economy. Region 6 also provided oversight of the depressurization of four flanged tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Air monitoring for tritium indicated no deviation from background levels.

Nationwide, this progress includes announcing a proposed rule that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of “pressure testing” Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

These 100 actions build on Administrator Zeldin’s list of 100 pro-environmental actions taken by the agency during President Trump’s First 100 Days in office and another 100 pro-environmental actions highlighted at the 200-day milestone to total 300 featured accomplishments.

We will keep working tirelessly to secure success after success for America’s environment and families nationwide.”

“EPA Region 6 is home to much of our nation’s energy, industry, and agriculture production as well as diverse landscapes and natural resources. Under the Trump Administration, our team has shown we can fulfill our mission to protect human health and the environment while not getting in the way of the economic development that’s Powering the Great American Comeback,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “We have accomplished a great deal in less than a year, and we’ll keep pushing to do even more for the environment, the economy, and the American people.”

This snapshot represents the great work done by the agency on a daily basis as EPA continues to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while committing to commonsense policies that drive down prices, unleash American energy, advance permitting reform and cooperative federalism, make America the AI capital of the world, and revitalize the auto industry.",,N,,2025-11-20 10:02:05.240708

After all, what can one possibly add to the conversation?

Well, one thing that’s struck us during the current wave of AI infrastructure euphoria is how closely the pitfalls of these two mega-trends align.

For starters, both mega-trends carry more than a hint of missionary zeal.

While most reasonable people can agree the energy transition is a key plank in the fight against climate change, that does not mean all its projects will deliver a good return on investment.

Stonepeak chairman, CEO and co-founder Michael Dorrell, for one, complained about renewables’ “uninteresting” returns from the 2010s onwards, noting there had been “an awful lot of capital chasing these projects – and a lot of that capital was socially driven, as opposed to economically driven”.

In the AI world, the quest for ‘artificial general intelligence’ and its purported benefits is often pursued with a messianic fervour that threatens to cloud a focus on ROI. The latter was highlighted in a recent, much-discussed JPMorgan report on what’s needed for a projected $5 trillion in AI infrastructure capex to make economic sense.

“Big picture, to drive a 10 percent return on our modeled AI investments through 2030 would require ~$650 billion of annual revenue into perpetuity. For context, that equates to 58bps of global GDP, or $34.72/month from every current iPhone user, or $180/month from every Netflix subscriber,” the report stated.

Even if some companies are able to generate the required revenue from their AI offerings, JPMorgan warned there could be some “spectacular losers as well”.

The scale of the opportunity in both mega-trends is thus a blessing and a curse.

Which brings us to a second common point: ‘bragawatts’. Both sectors share a penchant for platforms boasting large-scale development pipelines. But as we found in our cover story last October, valuing renewables platforms is genuinely challenging, and there’s a distinct possibility that only a fraction of these extensive project pipelines will ever be built.

Given the multiple challenges facing AI infrastructure pipelines – securing power chief among them – it is entirely fair to be equally sceptical of their deliverability.

The energy transition and the AI infrastructure build-out are also inflationary, which puts the spotlight on affordability. A Rabobank report released in January concluded that a combination of factors will make the energy transition in Europe – the transition’s heartland – both inflationary and likely to increase price volatility until at least 2030.

Similarly in the US – the epicentre of data centre development – modelling by Carnegie Mellon University indicates that the growth of data centres and crypto‑mining could increase average national electricity generation costs by roughly 8 percent by 2030 under current policies. In high‑demand regional markets such as Virginia, costs could rise by as much as 25 percent.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, energy affordability was a key theme in the recent election in Virginia, with governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledging to lower energy costs “and make sure that data centres pay their fair share”.

It’s not just about affordability, though. Like any development boom that literally dots the landscape with new physical assets, both the energy transition and AI infrastructure are vulnerable to nimbyism and the accompanying political and regulatory fallout.

Industry veterans will recall that one of the stated objectives of the former UK government’s de facto onshore wind ban – which lasted from 2015-24 – was to stop projects it said were “often imposed upon communities without consultation or public support”.

Worryingly, a new report by Data Center Watch recorded 20 projects, representing around $98 billion, being blocked across the US in Q2 due to local opposition – “a turning point in data center development risk” and more than the total for all previous quarters since 2023, the organisation said.

Now, what would it mean to include the phaseout of fossil fuels in the final climate text?
So, it was a big effort that we could include that an objective is to phase out fossil fuels, which actually was not even that language.
We should stop producing, extending the frontier of production, and also stop the consumption and burning of fossil fuels.
So, the elephant in the room is the fossil fuels.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. We’re broadcasting from the U.N. climate summit — that’s COP30 — from the Brazilian city of Belém, the gateway to the Amazon. I’m Amy Goodman.

As delegates and leaders representing more than 190 countries continue negotiations, the Brazilian presidency is expected to release a new draft text today addressing some of the most pressing climate demands, including financing and the transition away from fossil fuels. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is in Belém today as pressure is mounting to include a roadmap to phase out oil, coal and gas in the final climate text. He may pass us at any moment. More than 80 countries from Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Pacific, as well as European Union member states and the United Kingdom, have joined those calls, with Colombia leading the efforts.

This all comes as frustration is mounting over the refusal by wealthier nations and some of the world’s worst polluters to properly fund climate adaptation efforts for Global South countries most impacted by the climate crisis, but those that did not cause it.

We’re now joined by Susana Muhamad, longtime environmentalist. She served as Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development from 2022 to this year. She was also the president of last year’s United Nations Biodiversity Conference held in Cali, Colombia. She is of Palestinian descent.

We welcome you back to Democracy Now!, Susana. We have spoken to you at past COPs. You were the main climate negotiator at one point for Colombia. If you can initiate this global audience into what COP means, even that, the Conference of Parties 30, 30 years, why this is so important, and what’s happening today with the Brazilian president here, and what you’re seeing in the texts that have been presented?

SUSANA MUHAMAD: Thank you so much, Amy, and I’m so glad to be here again this year.

Well, it’s very important to let the audience understand what this environment means. COP is the Conference of the Parties. Who are the parties? And the parties to what? The parties are the countries of the world that have subscribed the Convention on Climate Change. And this convention is an international treaty signed by the countries to be able to control and stabilize the climate, because we knew since 30 years ago — and that’s why it’s called COP30, because it’s the 30th time that the parties meet to try to solve this issue.

But what’s the reality? You have faced it in the United States during these years, that things are getting out of control, the climate. And the emissions, the CO2 emissions that produce this climate crisis, are increasing, not decreasing, and also that the climate is becoming more wild, if we can say it in simple words, and more dangerous, the situation.

So, this 2025 COP is critical, because scientists said that we needed to cut emissions by 42% compared to 2019 in 2030, but the reality is that we are in a trajectory, rather than to decrease 42%, to increase 16%. And rather than to stabilize the climate in 1.5, we are actually going to a trajectory to have an increase in temperature of 2.8 Celsius. And just to give your audience a dimension of what that means, we have never experienced in the last two geological eras this temperature. Humanity, since it’s a species alive on planet Earth, has never experienced this temperature. We have no clue, no idea what this means. And when we could see that happening? At the end of this century. And who will be living this? The children that were already born in this century. So, that’s why this conference is the only fora that we have internationally, globally. So, countries, agree and take action.

AMY GOODMAN: I’m going to ask you about what Kumi Naidoo yesterday, the South African climate activist, called “the F-word”: fossil fuels. Now, what would it mean to include the phaseout of fossil fuels in the final climate text? And how is it possible that that hasn’t happened before?

SUSANA MUHAMAD: Well, it happened for the first time in Dubai, which was actually a very interesting process, because it was in the Arab world, in the United Arab Emirates. And you know that the largest reserves of oil in the world are there, and the cheapest ones. So, it was a big effort that we could include that an objective is to phase out fossil fuels, which actually was not even that language. It was “transition away” from fossil fuels, because it’s a transition. But what does that mean? That we should change our source of energy. We should stop producing, extending the frontier of production, and also stop the consumption and burning of fossil fuels. And that is a whole change.

So, now what happens is that it has been two years since Dubai, and the Brazilian government actually gave licenses for exploration in the Amazon, in the Amazon Delta, outside in deep waters where the Amazon River comes, just weeks before this conference. It’s a very contradictory message, because, you know, the Amazon is the — is one of the pillars of climate stability. The Amazon absorbs so much CO2. And what happens when we create deforestation is that every hectare deforested emits CO2 and stops absorbing. So, if we lose the Amazon, which means deforestation of around 25%, we actually lose the control of the climate. And we are in the Amazon. This COP is in the Amazon in 2025, five years before we need to reach the goal to stabilize the climate. And the Brazilian government gives licenses for exploration of oil a few weeks before.

So, the elephant in the room is the fossil fuels. The Arab countries don’t want to speak about it. Actually, they are trying to bring back the decision of Dubai and say, “Oh, we are — we don’t feel that that’s correct,” which was a big effort. But the good news is that yesterday a coalition of 80 countries stood up and said, “We have to develop a pathway for the transition. We cannot leave this COP.” So, the elephant in the room has become now the main issue. And it has light, and it’s now in negotiated text. And now President Lula is coming today, and Brazil is now committed that this roadmap advances.

But I give you a sober fact. Right now countries are planning to expand fossil fuel productions in 120% more than what is required to stabilize the climate at 1.5 Celsius. And for you who are seeing us out there, remember what was the year 2024, and think about in your local area how was the climate that year. That was the first year that we reached, as an average temperature in the planet, 1.5 Celsius. I remember in my country, 400 municipalities out of 1,100 were without water. The largest city, Bogotá, went into rationalizing water for one year. We had fires. We have drought. And it was actually really, like, if that’s going to be the new reality, I cannot imagine what is with 2.8. And that’s actually the environmental limiting we are working towards.

And so, to summarize, the struggle in this COP is between the fossil capital and the countries that want to continue to live on fossil fuels, and the other countries that actually say we have to put humanity, environmental security first and save the children that were already born in this century.

AMY GOODMAN: Susana Muhamad, you used to be the chief negotiator on climate at the COPs. You were the climate minister. So, can you talk about the power of the oil lobby? I mean, we’re talking about over 1,600, the largest group of lobbyists ever. Also, there are 900 Indigenous representatives. That is the largest group of Indigenous representation. So, talk about the balance. And also, are Indigenous demands being considered here? I mean, Indigenous leaders shut down this COP on Friday for hours.

SUSANA MUHAMAD: It’s exactly — I think that’s the picture of the 21st century. You want to summarize this issue in one picture? It is the picture of the woman from the Amazon, the Indigenous woman, blocking the entrance of the COP, and on the other side of the fence, the military protecting the fortress of the COP. What fortress are you protecting? You’re protecting the fossil fuel capitalists. That’s who are you protecting.

And actually, the influence in these rooms of the fossil fuel lobby is huge. That comes in two forms: petrostates that have — even Colombia has its own oil state company, but also private companies that have their lobbyists. And it becomes a battle of, actually, the fossil fuel capital resisting change. This is what COP has become. This is what it’s about now, resisting the change from the fossil fuel capital.

And outside the fence of the COP, outside the military, not 900 — 900 were the ones that got accredited. We have 4,000 Indigenous peoples from all the Amazon that came during 25 days by boat through the Amazon River, from all the communities, from the eight countries of the Amazon. They have what they call the Indigenous Camp. They are there outside. These people, they do have the knowledge to save the planet. They do have the knowledge to save the Amazon. And we are not talking about that here. So, that’s why, on Tuesday, actually, they came by force, and they took over these corridors. And that presence of what I call the blood, the sweat, the tears of the people at the frontlines of the climate crisis is what we need inside this room. And unfortunately, although we have to say it is much better in Brazil than when we had the COP in Egypt, in the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, which we didn’t even were able to do the protest in the street, the march of climate — but that’s actually, I think, the forces in the 21st century, the people at the frontlines against the fossil fuel capital.

AMY GOODMAN: We only have a minute to go, but I wanted to ask you two quick questions. The significance of President Trump, for the first time the United States not sending a high-level delegation? Do you actually think that’s good or bad in terms of how they influence the outcome? And also, you are a Colombian of Palestinian descent. And your thoughts right now on what’s happening in Gaza?

SUSANA MUHAMAD: Yes, on the first one, it’s absolutely terrible the United States is not here. It is the second-biggest polluter in the world. And we, to be able — I mean, this is the problem. This problem cannot be solved by any single country. It has to be the global community together.

But the worst thing is the escalation of the conflict. Before, it used to be blocking here, as some countries are doing, but now it’s with military action. So, having the U.S. military deployment of military forces to the Caribbean have killed 80 Latin Americans, in total impunity, in the last two months, with nobody stopping that. And actually, my fear is that what President Trump is coming for is for the oil resources of Venezuela and also the minerals of Colombia and Latin and South America. If this is going to be the escalation of conflict, we actually are in a very bad shape. That’s why it will be a fantastic message from Brazil that more than 80 countries — the majority of countries said, “No, we are not going to change the agenda because there is military bullying from any powerful country right now. And we have to secure the humanity.”

And on Gaza, these are not issues that are not correlated, because they use Gaza as a laboratory, because they were able to move forward. And even President Trump declared in the Israeli parliament that the weapons were given by the U.S. to commit genocide, because this has happened, and the world, the United Nations, nobody could stop this. That’s why they have now the license, the green light, to start moving forward to pursue whatever interests they think they want to pursue. And this is why we have to strengthen the international community and multilateralism and also the resistance in the frontlines of these issues, because, I tell you something, people will not allow any military power to kill them. Even the Palestinians right now, with everything that has happened, are still resisting. And that’s actually a lesson from all of us, because if the defense of the environment will become a military conflict, we are already seeing in Palestine what will happen in the future. I don’t wish that future. I think we can actually — humanity can do better, and that we can be very proactive and productive in shifting this situation of climate crisis, rather than continue investing in arms, in armies and in defense, as the whole world is doing. So, there’s no money for climate, but then everybody, in two seconds, puts 5% of their GDP in defense.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, Susana Muhamad, we want to thank you so much for being with us, a longtime environmentalist, served as Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development from 2022 to earlier this year, also president of the 2024 U.N. Biodiversity Conference held in Cali, Colombia. She is of Palestinian descent.

COP30 High-Level Champion Dan Ioschpe said that the plan is “practical, science-based, inclusive, and uses the global stocktake as its guiding star.” The COP29 High-Level Champion Nigar Arpadarai emphasized that COPs are an important “check-point for delivery of climate actions,” but that progress needs to be made year-round. This session recognized the essential role of civil society, businesses, Indigenous peoples, and youth in advancing climate solutions, and Ioschpe plugged the UNFCCC Global Climate Action Tracker, which captures the activities of 20,845 companies, 14,439 cities, and 6,273 organizations.

Hot Seat: European Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra played defense at a press conference today. When grilled about the EU’s lack of formal support for a roadmap for a fossil fuel phaseout, Hoekstra stated that the EU “liked the idea” but is not tied to specific terminology. According to Carbon Brief, all countries in the EU except Italy and Poland have individually voiced their support of the roadmap. He repeatedly emphasized the EU’s overall dedication to deliver on the climate finance that countries agreed to at COP29 and reduce emissions 55% by 2030 and 90% by 2040 (compared to 1990 levels).

High Standards: The EU CBAM will go into effect in January 2026. A UNFCCC briefing gathered international trade and standardization experts to illustrate the work being done in the lead-up to implementation. Jacob Werksman, principal advisor to the European Commission, described the development of mechanisms to assess carbon prices and emissions, including rules around emissions verification. Some developing countries are concerned that CBAM policies unfairly impact their exports. Werksman defended the EU CBAM as a lever for green trade, rather than a trade measure in itself, and asserted that it will not have a negative impact on trade. According to the CBAM Economic Exposure Index, some countries will experience economic impacts if they do not shift their practices to reduce emissions (which is precisely the goal of this type of policy). Negative impacts are projected to be most concentrated in Egypt, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, India, and Mozambique.

Landmark Launch for Landscapes: The Scaling-Up Resilience in Africa’s Great Green Wall (SURAGGWA) program was officially launched this morning. The Green Climate Fund approved funding for the SURAGGWA program in July, with an investment of $222 million to restore degraded landscapes and build climate resilience across eight Sahel countries within the Great Green Wall region: Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal. The program will contribute to the broader initiative to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land, sequester 250 million tons of carbon, and create 10 million green jobs by 2030. Senegal’s Minister of Environment and Ecological Transition underlined the importance of fighting against poverty while ensuring sustainable development. He expressed hopes that the SURAGGWA program will foster collaboration across participating countries and stakeholders. Green Climate Fund Regional Director of Africa Catherine Koffman added that partnerships across all levels of governance will be especially critical due to the complex operating environment in a region marred by conflict.

Biodiversity, Quantified: An SDG Pavilion event showcased the Nature Conservation Index, which assesses conservation at the country level using 25 indicators spanning land management, threats to biodiversity, national capacity (financial, technical, and political), and future challenges to conservation. Of the 180 countries evaluated, Luxembourg ranks highest for its land protections, strong policies, and high biodiversity, followed by Estonia and Denmark. The last three ranks fell to Iraq, Turkey, and Kiribati, which holds the lowest score due to species decline and poor land protections. The U.S. ranks 37th, scoring low on indicators such as climate vulnerability, risk of ecosystem collapse, and species extinction.

Shell-ebrating Stories About Ocean Acidification: The International Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification (OA Alliance) held a virtual premiere of its short film, Changing Waters: Time for Action on Ocean Acidification. Juliana Corrales of the OA Alliance described recent efforts to revamp the messaging around ocean acidification—the chemical reaction that lowers the pH of seawater as the ocean is forced to absorb increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, hindering the ability of marine species to grow calcium carbonate structures like shells. With such a complex scientific topic, Corrales explained that the goal of the film is to motivate action by making the impacts of ocean acidification felt through stories from coastal communities in Washington State, Colombia, and Fiji.

Investable NDCs: The We Mean Business Coalition is looking to NDCs as roadmaps for investment. Over the last year, the coalition has worked with partners in Australia, Brazil, the EU, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, and the UK to understand how NDCs could be written to attract more private-sector interest to help deliver on their goals. The country-specific recommendations include having clear international coordination on traded products, consistent national policy, and complementary economy-wide and sector-specific targets.

A View from Thailand: A press conference hosted by the Global Forest Coalition gave the mic to Wanun Permpibul of Climate Watch Thailand, who discussed “false climate solutions” that commodify ecosystems and put a price on nature. Permpibul branded the blue economy initiatives of wealthy nations as coastal and marine resource grabs and a “recolonization of the ocean, one carbon credit at a time.” She also criticized loans and debt-for-nature swaps that lock developing countries into cycles of debt and dependency. On the reliance on critical minerals for the clean energy transition, she called out the extortive practices of lithium mining in the Philippines, rare earth mining in Thailand, and nickel mining in Indonesia. True climate solutions already exist in the Global South, Permpibul concluded, with fishers and farmers alike working to restore ecosystems—without private loans or carbon credits.

Pacific Islands Plan for Climate Consequences: Delegates met at the Pacific Pavilion to discuss the Pacific Regional Framework on Climate Mobility Implementation Plan, which builds on a mobility framework that Pacific Island countries agreed to in 2023. The implementation plan states that planned relocation, migration, and displacement are all inevitable due to climate impacts. To prepare, the region can take priority actions like conducting country risk assessments, creating a Climate Mobility Action Hub, increasing country-to-country dialogue on planned relocation, ensuring plans are culturally appropriate, and finding adequate funding.

Governance for Resilient Infrastructure: The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure released the Global Infrastructure Resilience 2025 report to guide countries in making climate-smart infrastructure investments. This second-edition report includes a broader set of risks that now includes extreme heat and cold events. It states that “resilience begins with governance. Weak enforcement of codes, outdated standards, and fragmented responsibilities often compound infrastructure risks. Strengthening regulatory compliance and institutional capacity must, therefore, be at the core of national resilience strategies.”

More on Resilience: At a side event on local leadership for global adaptation, speakers discussed the forces reshaping community resilience efforts. As Aditya Bahadur of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre explained, “the nature of risk is shifting rapidly,” and countries are seeing unanticipated pressure on emergency management systems due to multiple extreme events happening at the same time. Bahadur argued that it is unfortunately not realistic for public finance to close the adaptation gap, so local leaders need to use creative strategies like city resilience bonds and incorporating resilience into existing budget items. He further suggested using artificial intelligence to analyze big data sets that could inform more strategic investments of time and money. The event also highlighted the Beat the Heat Implementation Drive, an initiative launched last week at COP30, to support city-level resilience to extreme heat.

Hot Topic: At a UNFCCC side event, panelists shared examples of communities in vulnerable regions responding to extreme heat with early warning systems, adaptation finance, and other tools. Joyce Kimutai of World Weather Attribution said that national climate commitments have not kept up with the escalating heat risk associated with climate change even though predictions have improved. In the case of India, 76% of the population is in the high to very-high heat risk category. Vishwas Chitale of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water noted that many jurisdictions have heat action plans, but most lack information on localized hazards, humidity, and warm nights, and almost all lack heat vulnerability and risk assessments.

The measure passed the House Tuesday, largely along party lines. It passed the Senate three weeks ago and goes next to the president’s desk.

The action is the latest by Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration to erase President Biden’s environmental legacy and revert to what the first Trump administration achieved.

As Alaska’s all-Republican congressional delegation sees it, Biden’s plan for the NPR-A would’ve locked up about half the reserve to oil development.

Alaska Congressman Nick Begich says Congress is halting the resource-management whiplash by using the Congressional Review Act. It forbids reimposing a nullified rule.

“So a future administration can't come in and decide to do something similar without the express authorization of Congress,"" he said.

Development advocates say the Trump plan is more pragmatic and that regulatory certainty will attract investment.

House Democrats who opposed the change argued that the Biden plan protected wildlife species and the landscape of one of the least developed tracts in the federal inventory.

I. EPA and U.S. Army Corps Propose Revised WOTUS Definition After Sackett

On Nov. 17, 2025, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a proposed rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. The agencies stated that the proposal aims to “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency by clarifying the definition of ‘waters of the United States.’” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin emphasized the need to set “clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity.” The agencies stated that the proposal is intended to “restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.”

The proposed rule outlines the categories of waters that would fall within federal jurisdiction. As summarized by the agencies, WOTUS “would include (1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas; (2) most impoundments of “waters of the United States;” (3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments; (4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries; and (5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary. The agencies are also proposing to amend the exclusions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and certain ditches, and to add an exclusion for groundwater.”

The proposal introduces and clarifies key terms that will guide jurisdictional determinations post-Sackett:

Relatively permanent: Proposed to include features “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” The “wet season” construct “is intended to include extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year.”

Continuous surface connection: Proposed to mean “having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.”

Tributary: Proposed to mean “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” The proposal clarifies that a tributary “does not include a body of water that contributes surface water to a downstream jurisdictional water through a feature such as a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature, subterranean river, culvert, dam, tunnel, or similar artificial feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, wetland, or similar natural feature, if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow. When the tributary is part of a water transfer (as that term is applied under 40 CFR 122.3) currently in operation, the tributary would retain jurisdictional status.”

The proposed rule’s revised definitions and expanded exclusions for federal jurisdiction, including clarifications on groundwater, ditches, waste treatment systems and prior converted cropland, could significantly reshape which water features and wetlands are subject to federal oversight. If finalized, these changes could have far-reaching effects on landowners, farmers and developers in the regulatory roles of states and tribes. Stakeholders with ongoing or planned permitting under Clean Water Act Sections 402 and 404 should closely evaluate how the updated definitions and exclusions may affect jurisdictional determinations, especially regarding conveyances, breaks in surface connectivity and seasonal hydrology.

The agencies are soliciting public comment on the proposed rule for 45 days once published in the Federal Register. The EPA and the Army Corps will host two hybrid public meetings on the updated definition of WOTUS.

II. Trump Administration Proposes Closing Chemical Safety Hazard Investigation Board

In further efforts to downsize the federal government, President Donald Trump proposed eliminating the Chemical Safety Hazard Investigation Board (CSB). The CSB’s role is to make safety recommendations after root-cause investigations to prevent future chemical releases. As an independent nonregulatory federal agency, its investigations do not result in the issuing of fines, citations or jail time.

While the CSB has no authority to create or enforce the policy recommendations it makes as a result of its investigations, the investigations themselves can bring significant negative publicity and cause substantial business disruptions. In recent years, reportable incidents were shared publicly on the CSB’s website, including animated reenactment videos of chemical release incidents.

Since 1998 the CSB has issued more than 1,000 recommendations to address safety issues causing chemical release incidents. The CSB most recently released a final report on Sept. 25, 2025, detailing its investigation in an accidental anhydrous ammonia release at Cuisine Solutions, a prepared foods manufacturer, in Sterling, Virginia. Trump’s budget proposal will put similar investigations to an end.

The Trump administration proposed eliminating funding to the CSB “as part of the Administration’s plans to move the Nation towards fiscal responsibility and to redefine the proper role of the Federal Government.” The balance of the CSB’s remaining funds were directed to be used for “expenses necessary to carry out the closure of the Board.” Id. at 1048.

The Trump administration argues the CSB is duplicative of other agencies such as the EPA and OSHA. This argument is reinforced by the fact that the CSB has no authority to create or enforce the policy recommendations from its studies. Supporters of the CSB counter that the nonregulatory nature of the CSB is intentional and works to ensure broad enhancements for public safety that only independent investigations can bring.

If Congress adopts the president’s recommendation and closes the CSB, businesses will see a reduction in negative publicity after accidental chemical releases and face less confusion caused by oversight from multiple agencies. However, businesses will still be subject to investigation by the EPA, OSHA or other agencies with jurisdiction after accidental chemical release incidents. Businesses also will continue to face potential liability.

III. EPA Proposes Updates to Chemical Risk Evaluation Process Under TSCA

On Sept. 22, 2025, the EPA published a proposed rule to revise how it evaluates risks of chemicals already in commerce under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Zeldin stated the proposal brings a “clear, predictable, commonsense approach” that supports safety and economic growth, in line with Trump’s Executive Order 14219 and the administration’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” agenda. The proposed rule revises elements of the 2024 regulation, Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation under TSCA.

Proposed changes include:

Requiring risk determinations for each condition of chemical use, not just the substance as a whole.

Clarifying how worker protections (e.g., PPE, industrial controls) are considered.

Outlining the EPA’s discretion in selecting uses and exposure pathways to evaluate.

Updating definitions and processes to ensure transparency and meet legal deadlines.

Adjusting requirements for manufacturers requesting EPA-led risk evaluations.

The public comment period for the proposed rule ended on Nov. 7, 2025.

IV. EPA Considers Revoking Endangerment Finding

In 2009, the EPA issued the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act — known as the “Endangerment Finding” — which concluded that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and supported regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. EPA later made generally similar endangerment findings to support regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from various industries, such as power plants and oil and gas facilities. The Finding listed six greenhouse gases for the danger they pose together to public health and welfare: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride.

The Endangerment Finding traces back to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act and directed the EPA to determine whether they endanger public health and welfare under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA’s determination that six greenhouse gases meet the endangerment criteria enabled the agency to regulate emissions from vehicles. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the Finding and the Supreme Court declined review. The Finding has since served as the legal cornerstone of federal climate action.

On July 29, 2025, the EPA proposed revoking the Endangerment Finding. Without the Endangerment Finding, the EPA lacks authority under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act to set emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines. The EPA simultaneously proposed eliminating greenhouse gas emission regulations for vehicles.

Under the proposal, engine and vehicle manufacturers would no longer have future obligations to measure, control or report greenhouse gas emissions for any highway engines or vehicles, including model years produced before the proposal. The EPA would, however, keep in place rules governing criteria pollutant and air toxic testing and standards, Corporate Average Fuel Economy testing, and related fuel economy labeling requirements.

The EPA asserted that, if adopted, the proposal would remove the legal foundation for an estimated $1 trillion in costly regulations and yield more than $54 billion in annual savings. The EPA contends that sweeping vehicle greenhouse gas regulations created major uncertainties and substantial costs for the auto industry. According to the EPA, revoking the Endangerment Finding would deliver greater certainty and regulatory relief so that companies can plan effectively, giving consumers greater access to affordable vehicle choices.

The deadline for public comments on the EPA’s proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding was Sept. 22, 2025. With the federal shutdown, a decision on revoking the Endangerment Finding may be delayed until early 2026.

V. EPA Extends Deadlines for Coal Ash Groundwater Monitoring

On July 17, 2025, the EPA issued a direct final rule and companion proposal that will extend the compliance deadlines for coal combustion residual (CCR) management unit (CCRMU) requirements under new CCR regulations that went into effect in November 2024. In the announcement, Zeldin stated that the rule would assist in keeping energy affordable and reliable by providing “much needed regulatory relief for the power sector.”

Under the 2024 CCR rule, certain areas of CCR disposal outside regulated units, as well as certain legacy CCR surface impoundments, will become subject to groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure and post-closure care requirements regardless of how or when that CCR was placed. Facility owners are required to conduct facility-wide evaluations to determine whether any CCRMUs exist on-site that contain greater than one ton of CCR.

The original deadline for these evaluations was February 2026. The EPA agreed to give companies an extra year, until Feb. 8, 2027, to inspect and report on their coal ash impoundments, while companies have until Aug. 8, 2029, to install groundwater monitoring systems. The remaining interrelated CCRMU compliance deadlines were also extended.

Originally, coal power plant operators were required to submit part one of their Facility Evaluation Report (FER Part 1) on Feb. 9, 2026. The second report (FER Part 2), which involves a physical evaluation of the facility, was due on Feb. 8, 2027. Under the 2025 direct final rule, facility owners may now opt to combine FER Part 1 and FER Part 2 into a single submission due Feb. 8, 2027.

The EPA determined an extension was necessary after receiving consistent reports of industrywide shortages of qualified contractors as well as issues with the aging infrastructure of the industry. Many existing records are physical documents in poor or illegible condition. The EPA determined that a robust monitoring plan should not proceed until all CCRMUs are identified and mapped under the FER process, which will take larger operations additional time.

VI. Courts Uphold EPA’s Interpretation of Coal Ash Closure Requirements

Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act addresses the disposal of solid and hazardous waste, including coal ash, in the United States. The EPA promulgated the first coal ash disposal regulation in 2015. The 2015 rule established the process for closing CCR units that begin to contaminate groundwater. In 2020, an amendment to the 2015 rule reclassified unlined coal-residual units as “open dumps” requiring their closure beginning April 11, 2021, but permitted extensions up to Oct. 15, 2024, if owners could show compliance with all other requirements. In 2024, another amendment regarding “legacy ponds” included updates to the definitions of “liquids” and “infiltration.”

Gavin Power sought an extension of the April 11, 2021, deadline to close one of its CCR units. The EPA denied the extension request, in part, due to Gavin Power’s failure to comply with closure requirements on a separate closed coal-residual unit. Gavin Power had an unlined, closed coal-residual unit where coal ash was up to 40% flooded with groundwater.

Gavin Power appealed to the D.C. Circuit, arguing that the EPA amended the 2015 Rule to create a new waste-in-place closure requirement by prohibiting any groundwater saturation. The D.C. Circuit held that the minimize-groundwater-saturation requirement was clear from the text of the 2015 Rule, and no new legislative rule was created in denying Gavin Power an extension. See Elec. Energy, Inc. v. Envtl. Protec. Agency, 106 F.4th 31 (D.C. Cir. 2024).

Gavin Power attempted to bring an Administrative Procedure Act case before the Southern District of Ohio alleging that the EPA retroactively applied amendments to the 2015 rule to label Gavin Power a “significant noncomplier.” On Aug. 26, 2025, Judge Michael H. Watson entered an order in Gavin Power, LLC v. EPA. Judge Watson agreed that the minimize-groundwater-saturation requirement was not new; instead, the 2015 Rule always required units closed with waste-in-place to minimize inflow and outflow of groundwater. Watson held that this would be the case based on the plain text and following issue preclusion from the D.C. Circuit’s decision.

Citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947), Watson further held that, even if the EPA could be said to be applying a new principle retroactively, the EPA could do so when the “mischief of producing a result which is contrary to a statutory design or to legal and equitable principles” is greater than the “ill effect of the retroactive application.”

VII. Data Centers

The EPA announced an expedited chemical review for data centers to facilitate domestic expansion in AI. The EPA effort is accompanied by an executive order, “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.” The EPA hopes to get through what it has characterized as a “massive backlog of new chemical reviews” slowing down data center and AI projects.

Newly developed chemicals that the industry wants to use, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances for specialized cooling systems, are subject to environmental and health reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Any chemical that is not on the TSCA Inventory is considered a “new chemical substance.” If a chemical creates an “unreasonable risk,” it can be restricted by the EPA. Supporters of the change contend that the current process was not transparent and unreasonably slowed down business development.

The new expedited process will likely benefit other industries, such as the fossil fuel, nuclear and semiconductor industries, as they have corresponding business with qualifying projects.

In addition to the new stretch of offshore pipeline, the project also proposes building nearly 3.5 miles of onshore pipeline near and through New Jersey wetlands.
That’s the state regulatory agency tasked with setting utility rate increases and deciding whether the pipeline is necessary.
Even the city of New York, which would receive gas from the pipeline, agrees.","If constructed, the NESE pipeline would connect to an existing pipeline in Pennsylvania and then, after passing through New Jersey, run 23 miles underneath the ecologically sensitive Raritan Bay and the lower New York–New Jersey Harbor. The pipeline would end a few miles off the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, New York.

In addition to the new stretch of offshore pipeline, the project also proposes building nearly 3.5 miles of onshore pipeline near and through New Jersey wetlands. And it would necessitate building a new natural gas compressor station in northern New Jersey too—a tax on local air quality in one of the most populous regions of the country.

This very same proposal has failed several times. However, emboldened by the new political landscape and the Trump administration’s call for fossil fuel expansion, Williams tried its luck again and resubmitted the application for another go-round.

“Both states have taken 180-degree turns from their previous legal and scientific determinations,” says Mark Izeman, senior strategist with NRDC’s environmental health team. “And they’ve given no reasoned explanation for reversing course.”

The state water quality certificates from New York and New Jersey were one of the final steps to getting the project off the ground. Earlier this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also issued a rushed federal permit for the pipeline, which NRDC and Earthjustice attorneys are challenging in court due to its reliance on an outdated application that doesn’t account for current cost estimates, gas demand, or air pollution standards. Alarmingly, Williams doesn’t explain how it would avoid violating water quality standards.

The proposed dredging methods are also particularly damaging. “There’s not a good way to dredge here that’s protective for the environment,” Knicley says, “but they’ve chosen some of the most destructive ways possible.”

Burying a pipeline under a 23-mile stretch of seabed is inherently disruptive—but particularly so when the waterway in question has accumulated decades’ worth of pollution in its sediment. Left undisturbed, the harbor’s seabed has captured and contained pollutants that range from neurotoxic heavy metals like mercury, copper, and lead to synthetic “forever chemicals” such as PCBs and carcinogenic dioxins.

Dredging the seabed effectively kicks up this toxic history. The pollution would endanger still-recovering wildlife populations, such as oysters, clams, and other shellfish. Meanwhile, at the top of the food chain, species such as striped bass and humpback whales would ingest the largest amount of the contamination due to bioaccumulation. The pollution would also be a risk to public health.

“The water quality violations are really foundational,” Knicley says. “Can you safely swim here? Can you safely eat fish from here?”

Tens of thousands of people live near NESE’s impact zone—and even more enjoy New York and New Jersey’s beaches each year. “Our kids, when they were young, spent hours a day in the water,” Flynn recalls. “To see it become a cesspool, it’s horrifying.”

At the heart of the company’s argument for the pipeline is the claim that National Grid, the primary gas utility serving downstate New York, would struggle to reliably meet gas demand without NESE, particularly for heating during big winter storms. But this justification proves false, even when crunching the numbers from the New York Public Service Commission.

That’s the state regulatory agency tasked with setting utility rate increases and deciding whether the pipeline is necessary. The commission green-lit the project in its recently finalized long-term plan, despite the fact that in September, it determined that New York wouldn’t face any supply issues for at least 15 years.

Back in 2024, the commission did rely on a dire prediction from National Grid about the state’s inability to meet the demand for gas, but “anyone paying attention knew that this forecast was systemically inflated,” says Chris Casey, NRDC’s director of utility regulations in New York.

And the updated data showed that the NESE would effectively be an unnecessary and very pricey insurance policy. In a petition requesting the commission to rescind its approval, NRDC points out that it relied on outdated forecasts and failed to complete necessary cost-benefit analyses.

Meanwhile, smarter solutions already exist that can meet projected demand, especially given that NESE itself would only increase downstate New York’s natural gas supply by 13 percent. “Instead, we need to go heavy on energy efficiency and electrification and then do everything we can to get clean energy to meet our power needs,” Casey says.

Such alternatives—which would look like weatherizing and electrifying outdated buildings so that they require less gas for heating—would help solve supply issues. They would also have reverberating benefits, such as creating jobs, improving local air quality, and saving consumers money on their winter heating bills.

Even the city of New York, which would receive gas from the pipeline, agrees. In its comments on the commission’s long-term plan, city officials described NESE as a “leap backwards.” They went on to state that “National Grid had identified solutions to reliability concerns…and offers nothing now to explain why building NESE should be a preferred alternative.”

According to the National Grid, NESE would reduce energy costs for New Yorkers, but this claim rests on a flawed analysis and hinges on statewide benefits that are largely speculative. Even under National Grid’s own assumptions, its downstate customers—those in New York City and Long Island residents—would be footing the pipeline’s entire $1 billion–plus bill over the next 15 years.

These customers could expect more than a 3.5 percent increase in their gas bills that would effectively subsidize any of NESE’s theoretical benefits to the state.

“Are we just going to charge regular New Yorkers, who are already struggling with their utility bills?” asks Kim Fraczek, the director of the environmental nonprofit Sane Energy Project, which has fought the pipeline since its initial proposal. “This doesn’t sit well with us.”

As mandated by New York’s own climate law, the state needs to drastically reduce carbon emissions to meet its 40 percent reduction target by 2030—a goal that it’s already woefully behind on.

But with a federal administration that’s openly hostile to clean energy, elected state officials, including those in Albany, may see an all-of-the-above approach to energy policy as the safer political bet. The fact remains, however, that relying on fossil fuels is neither environmentally nor economically sound.

NESE would lock New York into decades of natural gas consumption right when the state should be picking up the pace on climate action. Williams’s pipeline would also reduce the urgency for clean energy investment and likely encourage regulators to lean more heavily on natural gas simply to get the most out of their investment.

“Regulators don’t tend to approve major infrastructure projects and then regulate in a way that they go underutilized,” Casey says. “It enables and creates pressure to increase gas demand—growth that isn’t planned and runs against state climate policy—just to defray the project’s substantial costs.”

With Clean Water Act certificates from both states in hand, Williams has gotten further with its NESE project now than it has in the past. But the battle against the pipeline continues, inside and outside the courtroom.

Lawsuits at the federal level and a petition for the New York Public Service Commission to revoke its approval are already underway. And as always, NRDC is pushing for the kind of clean energy initiatives, such as offshore wind development and energy efficiency programs, that demonstrate how fossil fuel projects like NESE are indeed unnecessary.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/fishing-new-york-harbor-JPNLwWr_HPI.jpg?h=0e5c3eaf&itok=RcVUiEAe,N,,2025-11-19 23:58:23.586507

Texas Tech University’s Global Laboratory for Energy Asset Management & Manufacturing (GLEAMM) has received $1.25 million in funding from Google’s philanthropy Google.org to advance research on artificial intelligence (AI) data center load management and electric grid flexibility. Google’s support is part of a $40 billion investment in Texas announced last week by Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Governor Greg Abbott.

The project addresses a critical challenge: AI workloads consume 10-100 megawatts per facility, creating significant stress on electric grids during peak demand periods. The research will explore how computational loads can be scheduled, modulated or geographically shifted to support grid flexibility while integrating renewable energy and energy storage.

Texas Tech is uniquely positioned to address these emerging challenges, combining proximity to several very large data center projects on the South Plains with access to diverse power sources, including substantial wind and solar generation, as well as world-class expertise and infrastructure at GLEAMM.

“Powering the next era of AI requires both world-class infrastructure and a resilient electric grid,” said Robert Barron-Pryce, Google.org Giving Manager at Google. “As part of our broader investment in Texas, we’re proud to support the work Texas Tech is doing to directly address the complex challenge of managing large data center loads. By helping accelerate their research on smart load scheduling and optimization, together we’re ensuring that Texas maintains reliable, affordable power while continuing to lead in technology innovation.”

The multidisciplinary research team includes Argenis Bilbao, senior director of GLEAMM; Manohar Chahama, assistant professor in the College of Arts & Sciences’ Department of Renewable Energy; and Stephen Bayne, vice president for national security & executive director, Critical Infrastructure Security Institute. Together, they bring expertise in AI, machine learning, renewable energy, energy storage integration, power systems and energy management.

Leveraging tools at GLEAMM designed explicitly for adoption at scale by resource facilities and industry partners, as well as Texas Tech’s real-world microgrid and real-time simulator, the team will model electrical systems with large data center loads and optimize scheduling based on renewable generation periods.

“I’m sincerely thankful to Google for their generous support,” Bilbao said. “I’m excited to use these funds to push forward our research on improving datacenter energy consumption, energy management and overall energy awareness, and to develop solutions that can be applied in commercial datacenter environments.”

The appropriations process is one of the most important, and overlooked, ways we protect public lands and outdoor recreation.
It’s how we ensure that public lands are well-managed, sustainable, and protected for everyone who loves the outdoors.
The outdoor community has played a key role this year in keeping public lands public and defending conservation policy.
Our voices are vital to ensuring public lands and waters get the funding and resources they need.","After a challenging year for the outdoors, beginning with the agencies losing up to 25% of their workforce and most recently weathering the longest government shutdown in history, America’s public lands and waters are feeling the strain. Visitors have noticed it too: closed visitor centers, overflowing trailhead trash cans, delayed trail projects, and thinning ranks of the rangers and specialists who make outdoor recreation possible.

But with Congress working on long-term appropriations bills that will fund our public land management agencies, right now is a key moment for the outdoor community to speak up and advocate for public land funding. Fortunately, the Senate Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, which passed out of Committee with strong bipartisan support earlier this summer, would provide stability for public lands. It maintains or expands funding for major recreation and conservation programs, and provides clear Congressional direction on how funds for public lands and waters should be spent.

Over the past year, staffing at the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Forest Service has dropped by up to 25%. That’s thousands of permanent employees—including many who work directly on recreation, conservation, planning, permitting, and visitor safety.

These losses hit every part of the recreation experience: fewer people to process trail proposals or climbing management plans, slower maintenance cycles, and limited capacity to partner with local nonprofits and volunteers. At the same time, participation in outdoor recreation is near record highs.

This year’s government shutdown left public lands open but understaffed. Agencies furloughed thousands of staff, putting basic maintenance on the back burner, even as visitors continued to recreate on our public lands.

Although Outdoor Alliance has written many times about the long and complex appropriations process, Congress hasn’t actually passed full-year funding bills for public lands in over a year. Instead, a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) have kept the government running.

“This year made one thing clear: a world-class public lands system needs long-term funding and adequate staffing. Public lands are the backbone of a $1.2 trillion outdoor recreation economy, and they deserve stable, bipartisan support. Congress has a real opportunity right now to pass a full-year funding bill that will help land managers get back on their feet and give communities the certainty they need. We hope lawmakers to finish the job,” said Adam Cramer, CEO of Outdoor Alliance.

The appropriations process is one of the most important, and overlooked, ways we protect public lands and outdoor recreation. As more people head outside and climate impacts strain our parks, trails, rivers, and forests, agencies like the Forest Service and BLM need stable funding for staff and resources to keep up. Starting with the President’s budget and stretching through hearings, committee work, and negotiations almost all year, appropriations determines whether trails get maintained, campgrounds stay open, and wildfires are managed responsibly. Outdoor Alliance and our partners engage at every step—submitting testimony, meeting with lawmakers, and mobilizing outdoor enthusiasts—because without adequate funding, even the best outdoor policies can’t be implemented. It’s how we ensure that public lands are well-managed, sustainable, and protected for everyone who loves the outdoors.

The outdoor community has played a key role this year in keeping public lands public and defending conservation policy. Our voices are vital to ensuring public lands and waters get the funding and resources they need. Outdoor Alliance will continue working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to advance a strong, bipartisan appropriations bill. With your help, we can ensure that the places we love—and the people who care for them—get the support they need.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54aabb14e4b01142027654ee/t/691e5cee9a63262492a63af8/1763597550743/gantas-vaiciulenas-mzR7Ksf2UEA-unsplash.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-19 21:59:14.724370

Some are betting on better APRs or extra rebates, some expect price cuts as automakers clear 2025 inventory, and some are aligning their purchase with the last window for certain tax credits or rebates. Here’s a recent comment from Reddit:

“I’m looking to purchase a Premium AWD Tesla Model Y in the next 6 months.

Given the tax credits have now expired, do folks here think there will be some additional incentives the company will give out to reduce pricing a bit?

End of year sale? 0% APR?

Should I buy now or wait till end of year?

Thanks!”

Impact of the Federal Tax Credit Expiration

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit at the end of September created a shock in the electric vehicle market. Many of the most affordable EV deals relied on a leasing loophole that allowed automakers to pass the tax credit directly to consumers. Once that loophole closed, prices rose and sales dropped sharply. EV sales appeared especially weak in October because shoppers had rushed to buy in July through September in order to beat the deadline, which caused artificially high comparisons. Analysts note that the sales decline was influenced by both the loss of incentives and the pull-ahead effect created by months of frantic buying.

Current Availability of EV Deals and Lease Offers

Even without the tax credit, manufacturers are still offering attractive lease and finance deals to keep EVs moving. Low monthly payments, ultra-low down payments and 0% financing terms make many models appealing for first-time EV shoppers. Automakers have stepped in with incentives to make up for some of the lost $7,500 credit, and these programs are helping soften the drop in demand. Buyers with good credit are still finding opportunities to test EV ownership without committing to full purchase prices.

Some EV Deals Available Today

A wide range of EVs currently feature competitive lease or finance offers. Budget-friendly options include the Kia Niro EV with the cheapest monthly payment in the segment and the Ford Mustang Mach-E that brings strong performance for the price. Subaru is offering the Solterra with an especially low upfront cost as dealers work to clear out 2025 inventory. Luxury shoppers can explore the Mercedes-Benz EQB at a noticeable discount due to its upcoming discontinuation. Larger families have appealing choices such as the Kia EV9 and the Honda Prologue, while shoppers seeking great acceleration, charging speed or maximum value can gravitate toward the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6 or Kia EV6. Ford continues to attract interest with the F-150 Lightning thanks to strong capability and a lease option that keeps the payment competitive for a full-size electric pickup.

Why EV Sales Fell After September

The sharp sales decline following September was dramatic. J. D. Power reported that EVs dropped from 12.9 percent of new vehicle retail sales in September to only 5.2% in October. CarGurus observed an even steeper fall, estimating a 68% decline in early October compared to early September. Analysts caution that the drop is not solely caused by the tax credit expiration, since many buyers had already rushed to purchase in previous months. The market is now working through the gap left after that buying surge, which makes current demand look softer than it may actually be.

Automakers Are Giving Aggressive Incentives

Automakers are responding with aggressive programs aimed at restoring affordability. Companies like General Motors are raising residual values on leases to recreate some of the financial benefit of the former tax credit. Many manufacturers are embracing bigger discounts, which reached an average of more than $13,000 in October, a sharp increase from earlier in the year. The goal is to entice buyers who may have missed the tax credit or who did not qualify. Analysts expect these incentives to continue as companies work to rebalance demand, manage inventory and preserve momentum in the EV market.

Pricing Challenges and the Need for More Affordable EVs

Used EV prices have fallen to far more accessible levels, yet the number of budget-friendly new EVs remains limited. Dealers and analysts agree that expanding lower priced electric options, such as the upcoming return of the Chevrolet Bolt, will play a major role in rebuilding demand. Consumers consistently respond to vehicles that offer appealing value at mainstream price points.

Growing Interest in Hybrids and Changing Consumer Habits

Range anxiety and long charging times continue to steer many buyers toward hybrids and plug-in hybrids. These vehicles provide better fuel economy without requiring drivers to adjust their daily habits. Dealers are reporting noticeable growth in hybrid demand, driven by shoppers who want efficiency at a reasonable price. Analysts believe this trend reflects a broader shift in consumer expectations rather than a rejection of EVs. Shoppers are increasingly open to alternatives, provided that the price makes sense and the vehicle fits familiar routines.

Long-Term Outlook for EV Adoption

Industry experts do not expect the EV sector to fade. Automakers have already invested heavily in electrification and will continue refining their product lines to align with consumer preferences. Analysts predict that EV adoption will grow over time as pricing improves, more body styles become available and charging convenience continues to expand. Many believe the market is entering a transitional phase rather than a permanent downturn, and that affordability will be the key driver of future growth.

The Tesla Model Y

The Tesla Model Y has become one of the most popular electric vehicles because it blends great range, quick acceleration and practical, everyday usability in a way that resonates with a wide audience. It launched in early 2020 and quickly reshaped the EV landscape as drivers appreciated its roomy cabin, efficient powertrain and smooth driving experience. The vehicle stands out from other EVs because it offers access to Tesla’s extensive Supercharger network, simple software focused controls and frequent over the air updates that keep the car feeling modern long after purchase. The combination of performance, efficiency and tech is what keeps the Model Y at the center of many EV conversations today.

Bottom Line

The EV market is facing a short-term adjustment following the loss of the federal tax credit, yet it remains active and full of opportunity. Automakers are using creative incentives to keep EVs appealing, and several models are being offered at attractive lease and finance terms. Consumers are exploring hybrids and plug-in hybrids as they balance efficiency and convenience, while the industry works toward delivering more affordable electric options. The next chapter of EV growth will hinge on price, value and the ability of manufacturers to meet buyers where they are.

What Do You Think?

Do you believe automakers will drop prices again in December, or do you think current incentives are as good as they will get?

Have you noticed EV prices or APR offers changing at your local dealers since the tax credit expired?

The company first promised a gloriously blocky off-road truck before pivoting to a shockingly fun electric commercial truck. Amazingly, Bollinger even managed to kick off production. But things haven’t been so rosy for the company lately. According to a recent report, conditions within the Bollinger are rough, as employees have been laid off and others haven’t even gotten their paychecks.

Normally, a story like this wouldn’t pop up on my radar, but I was one of the fans of Bollinger Motors. I drove the company’s B4 electric trucks back in 2023, and they were honestly way more fun to drive than any delivery truck had any right to be. The B4 is a box truck that you could hoon!

I was also excited to hear that, against all odds, Bollinger actually brought the truck into serial production. Too many startups deliver nothing but vaporware, but true to Bollinger’s word, its trucks have actually delivered real goods in real life. Sure, Bollinger wasn’t building anything as cool as its original ideas, but I love a good Detroit underdog story. Sadly, what started as a story of triumph is now one of pain. According to both Crain’s Detroit Business and the Detroit Free Press, Bollinger has been struggling so much that suppliers and employees aren’t getting paid.

How We Got Here

It’s been a hot minute since we last talked about Bollinger, so let’s review how the company got here. This is what I wrote in my previous reporting:

Robert Bollinger founded Bollinger Motors in Hobart, New York [ten] years ago. At the time, Bollinger had ambitious plans, stating: “Trucks have had the same design flaws for a hundred years and someone needs to do something about it.” How ambitious are we talking about, here? Bollinger said he was going to build the “world’s first all-electric on- and off-road sport utility truck.” Now, keep in mind that this was before today’s popular electric trucks and SUVs hit the road, so this statement had impact. So, Bollinger announced an electric SUV and an electric pickup truck; from my B4 commercial truck first drive:

Bollinger’s truck ideas rose from a need. See, Bollinger’s enjoyed a colorful career working for Manhattan ad agencies before pivoting to an organic hair and skincare company then finally landing at co-founding a grass-fed cattle farm. While running the farm, Bollinger felt that there really wasn’t a truck out there that was both a practical farm vehicle and a fun off-road toy. This motivated Bollinger to fulfill a lifelong dream and he created Bollinger Motors with the idea of creating a heavy-duty Sport Utility Truck that got work done during the week and had fun on the weekends.

In 2018, the company moved to Ferndale, Michigan, to grow its team and take advantage of proximity near automotive suppliers, engineering talent, and potential manufacturing partners. A year later, Bollinger moved again to Oak Park, Michigan. Bollinger had been working on the B1 SUV and B2 Pickup for years. Development started with a team of engineers who lived with each other in a bunkhouse before the truck was first unveiled in 2017. Bollinger then missed its delivery targets multiple times as development continued. The company also briefly flirted with a panel van concept and chassis cabs.

Bollinger canned the B1 and B2 in 2022, disappointing the strong fanbase he built. But the company wasn’t really giving up. Instead of building a funky off-roader, Bollinger said, it was secretly working on a Class 4 commercial truck platform. This was because Bollinger had seen lots of interest for a Class 4 truck for local deliveries and landscaping. Demand was already there for a commercial truck, so Bollinger followed the money. That year, Mullen Automotive bought a controlling stake in Bollinger.

The Trucks Are Fun

The B4 truck also signaled a change in philosophy for Bollinger. The B1 and B2 were clean sheet designs intended to use as many bespoke components as possible. But the B4? It was designed to source as many components from other companies as possible. That way, Bollinger didn’t have to build an entire vehicle from the ground up. Everything from the truck’s cab, which comes from China, to its battery, which comes from Our Next Energy in Michigan, is thanks to an army of suppliers. The trucks are assembled right there in Michigan by Roush.

I also thought the trucks were a riot to drive:

The Bollinger B4 surprised me in how much it didn’t drive like a commercial truck. The Mcity proving ground was too small for me to really find the limits of the Bollinger trucks, but I got to do things with those trucks that I’d never try with my bus or any of the other trucks I’ve driven.

Out of the gate, I decided to punch the accelerator. The B4 moves like any other EV. It takes off with a satisfying kick of torque and the electric motor gets the speedometer rising way faster than you’d expect a commercial vehicle to go. I’m sure you’ve gotten stuck behind garbage trucks and the like at stoplights. Well, the B4 accelerates fast enough that it could be a garbage truck that is faster than you are between stoplights. The B4 is not “fast,” as in, it’s not going to pull your face’s skin back, but it’ll make a comparable diesel look like it’s sitting still. It’s fast enough that Bollinger tells me some customers want a power limiter so that drivers don’t have too much fun.

That quick dose of power is supported with surprisingly good handling. See, “handling” and “delivery truck” don’t tend to jive well. Try to go full lock and full throttle in a regular truck and you might have a bad day. Bollinger’s trucks have their center of gravity so low that the engineers actually encouraged going full lock while hard on the throttle. There was tons of body roll, sure, but the truck felt planted even when I was at full lock and pushing the truck harder and harder. The tires gave up traction long before the truck felt unstable.

I wouldn’t even drive a U-Haul truck as hard as I sent a Bollinger.

Everything seemed promising. Bollinger had businesses that wanted its trucks, and its trucks weren’t reinventing the wheel, just taking existing technology and packaging it well. In theory, it should have been successful!

A Bumpy Road

Well, as it turns out, my optimism might have been misplaced. Crain’s Detroit Business released a report on Monday that paints a depressing picture of the company:

Electric truck manufacturer Bollinger Innovations Inc. is facing dozens of complaints over unpaid wages and a new stack of lawsuits by suppliers seeking millions of dollars in past due payments — and the state of Michigan is among those with money on the line. The Oak Park-based startup, which promised in 2023 to invest $44 million and create 237 jobs in metro Detroit, is in default of its incentives agreement with the Michigan Economic Development Corp. The company was awarded $3 million by the state to help launch its Class 4 EV and has collected about a third of the cash.

[…]

As of Sept. 30, Bollinger had no qualified new jobs and 50 base employees, MEDC spokeswoman Danielle Emerson said. The company has laid off employees since then, Crain’s confirmed, though it is unclear how many. Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

Bollinger has until May 4 to cure the default by reaching job milestones and “will be required to pay back all or a portion of those funds” if it fails to do so, Emerson said. At the same time, the company is under investigation by the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, which has received 59 claims against the company about unpaid wages or benefits, department spokesperson Keely Lovern said.

It somehow gets worse. In March, Robert Bollinger–who stepped down as CEO before eventually leaving his company–sued Bollinger Motors for a $10 million loan he gave the company back in October 2024. This summer, the company claimed it was broke and sought help via recievership in June to pay back that loan. Since then, Crain’s writes, Mullen Automotive CEO and chairman David Michery paid Robert Bollinger back and promised to do the same for suppliers.

Post-receivership, Bollinger and Mullen were merged to create Bollinger Innovations. Unfortunately, it sounds like the money problems were never really solved, from Crain’s:

A half-dozen suppliers sued Bollinger earlier this year, demanding payment of more than $5 million in outstanding bills, Crain’s reported in July. Those cases have since been disposed, but six different suppliers are now suing the company in active cases, according to Oakland County Circuit Court records.

Canadian supplier Promark Electronics Inc., German supplier Thyssenkrupp AG, Brazilian supplier Metalsa, Livonia-based Testron Corp., Troy-based Engineering Technology Associates Inc. and California-based Aibond Corp. are the plaintiffs in those cases.

Bollinger Innovations was delisted from the Nasdaq a month ago after failing to meet its market value requirements. Michery tried to remain in compliance by conducting nine reverse stock splits in three years, but its share value continually fell below the $1 minimum. The company is trading stock on the open markets at 13 cents per share as of Monday afternoon.The company incurred a net loss of $304.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, according to the most recent financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August. Its accumulated deficit at the time was $2.6 billion.

The Drive also wrote about this, quoting an anonymous tipster. That tipster claimed that payroll is weeks behind, there is no operating cash left in the company, and the company’s customers and dealers have no idea what’s actually going on. I have reached out to Bollinger for clarification and comment on its current condition.

It’s also unclear what this means for Bollinger’s future. The company wants to make a larger Class 5 truck called the B5. Robert Bollinger also isn’t giving up his electric pickup truck dream. But all of that is going to take money, and it seems Bollinger is struggling with that part right now.

I will update this story if I learn anything more. What’s most important, I think, is that everyone gets paid. Then, hopefully, Bollinger can get past this pothole and keep on trucking.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan's attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” Earthjustice lawyer Michael Lenoff said.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

Nick Schifrin: Of course, the Trump administration has focused on rare earth minerals well beyond Saudi Arabia.
Nick Schifrin: Saudi officials insist they are not after a bomb and actually trust in U.S. nuclear umbrella, they don't want their own nuclear weapon.","Amna Nawaz:

President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman concluded the Saudi crown prince's visit to the U.S. today by speaking to more than 400 business leaders.

Beyond a defense agreement and talk of the kingdom's human rights record, the visit focused on joint U.S.-Saudi adventures, including extracting Saudi minerals critical to everything from fighter jets to cell phones, and helping Saudi Arabia build a civilian nuclear program.

Nick Schifrin is here to discuss that now.

So, Nick, let's begin with that deal over rare earth minerals. Why is that so important?

Nick Schifrin:

You just said it, Amna.

These rare earth minerals and magnets that are produced by them go into everything, from electric vehicles to the world's most advanced fighter jet, the F-35. And Saudi Arabia says that it has the fourth most valuable deposit of rare earth in the world.

But, right now, China has a near monopoly on what are known as heavy rare earths. They do 90 percent of the processing, and China produces 93 percent of all those earth magnets that are required for high-end manufacturing.

So the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have agreed that an American company, MP Materials, whose biggest shareholder right now is the U.S. government, in fact, will own just about half of a rare earth refinery in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. and Saudi will mine and process the rare earths, and then that will go to the U.S., Saudi, and its allies in order to produce those magnets.

In the long run, the idea here is to reduce U.S., reduce Western reliance on China, because we saw China withhold some of those rare earth magnets in the conversations with President Trump this year. It also taps into something that Saudi officials say, that they are looking for the next big oil giant, like Aramco, and that it might be there in rare earths.

So take a listen to Gracelin Baskaran of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Gracelin Baskaran, Center for Strategic and International Studies: Saudi Arabia is absolutely emerging as one of the biggest mineral superpowers. What we see here is actually one of the biggest heavy rare earth deposits in the world. And given that Saudi did have Aramco, it has a lot of the infrastructure needed to become a minerals production and processing superpower.

And, again, remember that the U.S.-Saudi relationship was built on natural resources. It was the oil for security agreement. So what we see of that is just the next era of that, going from oil to mineral.

Nick Schifrin:

Of course, the Trump administration has focused on rare earth minerals well beyond Saudi Arabia. It has made deals with Japan and Australia. There's a huge push to compete with China.

But, Amna, one study says that, even though the West is trying to make these strides on rare earth minerals, the West will still rely on China for 90 percent of heavy rare earths past 2030.

Amna Nawaz:

Ninety percent.

Meanwhile, there's another agreement on nuclear power technology. What has the U.S. agreed to there?

Nick Schifrin:

So, the secretary of energy, Chris Wright, announced this today. He had a signing ceremony with his counterpart and said that two countries have completed negotiations on civil nuclear cooperation.

And on FOX News, Wright described this deal exclusively as helping Saudi Arabia diversify its energy products, its energy sources by building a nuclear power plant.

Chris Wright, U.S. Energy Secretary:

This is just for civil nuclear construction of a power plant, American technology, American companies to build a very large nuclear power plant in Saudi Arabia. It's not about enrichment. It's not about anything related to weapons. It's just about generating electricity, secure, reliable, affordable electricity.

Nick Schifrin:

So you heard Wright say that it's not about enrichment, it's not about weapons.

But the negotiations that have led to this have very much been about enrichment, about Saudi Arabia's desire to make nuclear fuel perhaps inside Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials say that they have 7 percent of the world's uranium and in fact it's colocated with all those rare earths that we were just talking about, and that asking the kingdom to mine uranium in addition to those rare earths would kind of — without enriching, without creating the nuclear fuel, would be kind of like asking Saudi Arabia to get all of the oil out of the sand many years ago without refining the oil.

That's the kind of deal that they're trying to get. But the community that's been focused on nonproliferation has had their concerns about Saudi Arabia. They have been concerned that Saudi Arabia has resisted some of the monitoring and inspections that would go along with this kind of agreement. And, frankly, they have been concerned about Saudi intentions all along.

So take a listen to Henry Sokolski with the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center.

Henry Sokolski, Executive Director, Nonproliferation Policy Education Center:

They want a bomb option. I think they have been very clear privately to various contractors that I have been in contact over the years that that's the bottom line. I think that's the reason they have been insistent about getting enrichment, when it doesn't make economic or practical sense.

Nick Schifrin:

Saudi officials insist they are not after a bomb and actually trust in U.S. nuclear umbrella, they don't want their own nuclear weapon.

Nonetheless, Energy Secretary Wright said that today's deal has what he called — quote — ""bilateral safeguard agreements."" He hasn't spelled that out. One solution here, Amna, that I'm told is that American companies could do the enrichment inside the United States, and Saudi Arabia thinks that might be more economically viable than doing the enrichment in Saudi Arabia.

Amna Nawaz:

Meanwhile, interestingly, we heard President Trump say that the crown prince had actually pushed him on the issue of Sudan during this visit. What do we know about what was behind that crown prince's message?

Nick Schifrin:

So, Sudan has been driven by horrific violence for many years, but there's been an explosion of violence especially just in the last few weeks.

Here is some of it. We're blurring it, it's so horrific. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has been committing what the U.S. has labeled as genocide against non-Arabs in El Fasher in North Darfur. Thousands perhaps, tens of thousands are feared dead.

Beyond the humanitarian issues, Amna, Saudi Arabia has been very concerned that Sudan could spread, that instability in Sudan could invite terrorism into the region. And MBS pushed President Trump to confront this crisis, as Trump himself said today.

President Donald Trump:

His Majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan. It was not on my charts to be involved in that. I thought it was just something that was crazy and out of control. But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room, Sudan. And we're going to start working on Sudan.

Nick Schifrin:

Saudi Arabia wants to see President Trump impose secondary sanctions on the United Arab Emirates, one of the RSF's most important external factors, and the RSF itself be labeled a foreign terrorist organization.

Amna Nawaz:

All right, Nick Schifrin, thanks, as always.

Nick Schifrin:

From its initial cohort of entrepreneurs, the organization has expanded to offer an eight-week core curriculum (BUILD Basics), followed by advanced growth-oriented tracks.
The announced pause at the end of 2025 signals a moment of reflection, both for the organization and for Detroit’s micro-business support network more broadly.
During the pause window, alumni-engagement and community mapping efforts may become more prominent, as BUILD looks to evolve its supporting architecture.
The Board’s decision invites the entrepreneurial ecosystem to reflect alongside BUILD: how might service-delivery evolve in a more resource-constrained environment?","In a significant turn for Detroit’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, the BUILD Institute announced that the organization’s Board of Directors has decided to pause operations at the end of 2025.

In a letter to its community, the board explained that it “recognize[s] that we are living in a time of great uncertainty for small business support organizations across Michigan.” The Board added that the pause offers “an opportunity to reassess how BUILD delivers on its mission, retool our programming, and evaluate new partnership opportunities and our overall business model to ensure long-term sustainability and impact.”

Since its founding in 2012 as part of the Downtown Detroit Partnership, BUILD Institute has become a cornerstone of inclusive entrepreneurship in Detroit. From its initial cohort of entrepreneurs, the organization has expanded to offer an eight-week core curriculum (BUILD Basics), followed by advanced growth-oriented tracks. Its mission focuses on under-represented and under-resourced community businesses, offering training, peer networks, mentorship, and access to capital.

The letter states that “in the coming months, we will continue all scheduled programming through December to ensure that all commitments to entrepreneurs and partners are honoured. During this time, we will also explore new ways to align our work with the evolving needs of our community, including our network of over 3,000 alums.”

To date, BUILD has graduated more than 1,700 participants in its classes, with over 560 businesses operational in Detroit, according to the organization’s impact reporting. In its 2023 “Our Impact” summary, BUILD reports that more than 1,700 graduates have generated approximately $56 million in annual labor income in the city; it further notes that for every dollar BUILD invests in an entrepreneur, an estimated $23.65 is added to the local economy through wages. The dataset also states that 83 percent of graduates are women and 63 percent people of color, with 73 percent coming from low-income backgrounds.

Beyond those headline figures, BUILD’s broader ecosystem has grown. Industry-reporting suggests that BUILD has supported over 2,600 aspiring and experienced business owners through its various programs; one article noted that its newer “BUILD Grow” and “Grow Evolve” programs — designed for businesses seeking to scale and systematize growth — are aimed at mature entrepreneurs who already have employees and revenue streams.

These programs underscore BUILD’s belief that entrepreneurship in Detroit is not only about start-ups but also about scaling neighborhood-based enterprises that often face invisible barriers to growth.

The announced pause at the end of 2025 signals a moment of reflection, both for the organization and for Detroit’s micro-business support network more broadly.

The board mourns no failure, but rather frames the decision as a strategic recalibration. It writes: “This moment offers us an opportunity to reassess… our overall business model to ensure long-term sustainability and impact.” By continuing scheduled programming through December, BUILD aims to uphold its commitment to current cohorts of entrepreneurs while it designs its next chapter.

This pause comes at a juncture when Detroit’s entrepreneurial landscape is evolving rapidly. While demand among neighborhood-based entrepreneurs remains strong, support organizations face rising costs, shifting funding landscapes and the need to demonstrate scalable impact in a more complex environment.

BUILD’s decision to pause — rather than simply wind down — gives it space to revisit key questions: how funding flows to micro-business providers; how programs can move beyond “launch” toward long-term sustainability; whether partner-led models can amplify reach; and how alumni networks can play a more active role in the ecosystem they helped build.

For entrepreneurs who have gone through BUILD’s programming, the news may come as a shock, but the board emphasized that the organization’s “network of over 3,000 alums” remains a focus.

The existing alumni base, composed largely of women and minority business owners, has often described BUILD as “like a family” — a community hub where shared experience, peer support and business advice extend beyond formal training. During the pause window, alumni-engagement and community mapping efforts may become more prominent, as BUILD looks to evolve its supporting architecture.

For the city of Detroit, neighborhood business owners remain anchors of commercial corridors: the coffee shops, storefront service firms, digital studios, makers and retail outlets that give life to blocks outside downtown’s marquee redevelopment zones.

BUILD’s mission has always been to support those “Main Street” value creators — those who often lack access to traditional capital, business advisory services or scaling support.

In practical terms, the pause means that BUILD will not admit new cohorts beyond the end of 2025, will close out or transition existing programs, and will spend the pause period exploring new program design, partnership structures and sustainable funding models. The Board’s decision invites the entrepreneurial ecosystem to reflect alongside BUILD: how might service-delivery evolve in a more resource-constrained environment? How might capital access, mentoring and peer networks be structured differently for scale-oriented micro-businesses? How might alumni themselves become co-creators of future support models?

The board closed its letter by inviting appreciation for the “team members and facilitators who have served Detroit’s entrepreneurs and supported BUILD’s mission since our founding in 2012,” and to engage questions via Hello@buildinstitute.org.

For many entrepreneurs, BUILD’s decision to step back, reflect, and redesign suggests that the strategy moving forward it to unlock a new wave of locally rooted business growth, one built on deeper networks, smarter capital access, and an ecosystem primed for long-term sustainability.",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/BUILD-Institute.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 21:00:29.691877

(AP) — The Trump administration has once again extended the life of a Michigan coal-fired power plant that was supposed to close last May as the utility Consumers Energy transitions to cleaner sources of electricity.

The U.S. Energy Department says there are “emergency conditions” that require the J.H. Campbell power plant to remain open to meet electrical demand in the central U.S. Otherwise, the government warned Tuesday, homes and businesses might go dark.

Critics scoff at that claim, and environmental groups and Michigan’s attorney general have gone to court to try to overturn orders keeping the plant online.

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” Earthjustice lawyer Michael Lenoff said.

The Campbell plant opened in 1962 near Lake Michigan in western Michigan’s Ottawa County. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people.

Consumers Energy planned to close it May 31, but the Energy Department ordered it to stay open for three months, citing a need for reliable electricity during the hot summer.

That decision has since been extended twice, and the latest order lasts until Feb. 17.

Consumers Energy acknowledged Wednesday that it will continue operating the plant. The net expense through September was pegged at $80 million, which will be shared by customers who are part of a multistate electric grid, the utility said in a securities filing in October.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday closed on a $1 billion loan to restart Constellation Energy’s 835-MW Crane nuclear unit in Pennsylvania. Constellation plans to sell power from the unit to Microsoft under a long-term contract.

Inspections of key components at the unit, formerly Three Mile Island Unit 1, and regulatory reviews are on schedule, Constellation said Tuesday. The Baltimore-based company expects to spend about $1.6 billion — about $1,916 per kilowatt — to restart the unit, possibly as soon as in 2027.

In 1979, Three Mile Island suffered a partial reactor meltdown in what is considered “the most serious accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history, although its small radioactive releases had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public,” according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Under the loan, Constellation will pay an interest rate of 0.375% a year over the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, the company said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Under the agreement, Constellation can borrow up to $1 billion through Sept. 15, 2030, according to the filing. The company must pay the loan back by November 2055.

“DOE’s quick action and leadership is another huge step towards bringing hundreds of megawatts of reliable nuclear power onto the grid at this critical moment,” Joe Dominguez, Constellation president and CEO, said.

The loan is part of the Trump administration’s effort to bolster nuclear power. It marks the first project to receive a concurrent conditional commitment and financial close under the Trump administration, DOE Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.

The unit’s restart will help lower electricity costs, strengthen grid reliability and create over 600 jobs, Wright said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/yHLXiiZQYcFvPoHu1mPTuXb667gcvA_xTWFVpbXxk_w/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTc3ODUxNTA5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-19 19:58:47.896526

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers have officially released a new Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule that aims to provide clarity and predictability under the Clean Water Act. This action is a significant development for American farmers, landowners, and businesses, addressing years of uncertainty surrounding federal water jurisdiction.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, joined by Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, announced the proposed rule would, “establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.”

Key Changes in the Proposed WOTUS Rule

The new proposal introduces several key definitions and clarifications designed to streamline the regulatory process and empower state and tribal governments:

Tributary Definition: Jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters directly or through features that provide predictable and consistent flow.

Wetlands: Wetlands must touch a jurisdictional water and hold water for a sufficient duration year after year to be regulated.

New Exclusions: The rule explicitly preserves and clarifies exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems, and adds a new exclusion for groundwater.

State and Tribal Authority: Clear regulatory guidelines are designed to strengthen state and tribal decision-making authority in protecting their local water resources.

Empowering Landowners and Advancing Cooperative Federalism

Administrator Zeldin emphasized the necessity of a practical, straightforward rule that supports both environmental protection and economic activity.

He stated, “When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity. Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families. We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property. EPA is delivering on President Trump’s promise to finalize a revised definition for WOTUS that protects the nation’s navigable waters from pollution, advances cooperative federalism by empowering states, and will result in economic growth across the country.”

This proposed rule reflects a commitment to protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution while reducing the regulatory burden on landowners and businesses. By establishing clearer lines of jurisdiction, the EPA and Army Corps aim to foster economic growth and empower local authorities, delivering a more transparent and effective approach to water regulation.

""Oregon faces escalating climate impacts, from record wildfires to extreme weather events that hit vulnerable communities hardest. Meanwhile, we must continue to make progress on our carbon pollution reduction goals and support reliable, affordable clean energy,” Kotek said in a statement.

The order directs agencies to assess their current plans and performance measures and update them as needed to implement recommended pathways from the Oregon Energy Strategy.

That report, required by a 2023 bill, said the state should pursue energy efficiency, clean electricity, electrification, low-carbon fuels and resilience as the least costly avenues to accomplishing Oregon's energy goals.

The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the Environmental Quality Commission will modify the Oregon Clean Fuels program to expand the timeline for reducing carbon intensity levels from 37% by 2035 to 50% by 2040. DEQ will also look at how Oregon's Low-Carbon Fuels Standard program compares to other states' and adjust it as needed.

Kotek's order calls for agencies to work together to make it easier to implement energy projects by evaluating Oregon's land use, permitting and infrastructure for challenges that could be tying up the process.

The Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) will work with the Public Utility Commission (PUC) and the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) to study red tape and construction holdups that could limit projects. ODOE will issue a report by September 2026.

An October executive order by Kotek pushed for solar and wind projects to be developed ahead of tax credits expiring in July 2026.

Kotek's new order also includes a goal of the state increasing its energy storage ability to eight gigawatts by 2045. Stored energy works as ""backup power"" and supports renewable sources.

Oregon currently has 500 megawatts of storage and is in the process of developing seven gigawatts, each of which is 1,000 megawatts.

Under the order, agencies must collaborate to promote programs aimed at increasing the number of clean energy jobs and companies in Oregon.

To do that, agencies will work on developing new partnerships between public and private entities.

ODOE, PUC and DEQ must file biennial reports outlining their plans and creating goals for carrying out the order. Public feedback will be taken on those reports, which will also say how much money the agencies may need beyond the 2027 to 2029 budget cycle.

The governor's office will oversee implementation of the order.","https://www.statesmanjournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/03/PSAL/75501219007-241003-gov-tina-kotek-media-event-4.jpg?crop=3942,2218,x0,y205&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 19:01:08.880184

The critical battleground from now to 2030 is downstream conversion – refining into lithium hydroxide or lithium salts, cathode precursor manufacture, and battery recycling.
With the advancement of AI and the need for data centres, as well as the need for energy storage capacity for solar and wind (renewables) energy via Battery Energy Storage Systems, will be key drivers moving forward.
“These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand” “These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand.
For example, Europe is accelerating its efforts to establish a self-sufficient lithium supply chain.","The downstream processing segment of the lithium market, encompassing the conversion of raw lithium into battery-grade lithium hydroxide and carbonate, is experiencing significant transformation.

This evolution is driven by technological advancements, geopolitical shifts, and increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), clean energy storage, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), among others.

The critical battleground from now to 2030 is downstream conversion – refining into lithium hydroxide or lithium salts, cathode precursor manufacture, and battery recycling. The raw ore business will increasingly act as a feedstock commodity.

Lithium hydroxide is gaining prominence due to its suitability for high-nickel cathode chemistries, which are prevalent in advanced EV batteries. The market for lithium hydroxide is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.51% from 2024 to 2029, reaching some 564.78 kilotons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) by 2029.

In Western markets such as Australia, Canada, the US, and European Union, governments and OEMs are pushing for more domestic or regional processing to bolster supply security, manage carbon footprints, and capitalise on what is poised to become a high-value industry.

Market analysts flag that scaling active material processing is possibly the limiting factor in many value chains. And failure to do so will leave miners squeezed.

Recycling and direct lithium extraction (DLE) is set to become increasingly important. Participants in industry roundtables consistently cite DLE as a technology frontier that could reshape cost and environmental profiles — provided it can scale and prove reliable.

In 2030, PwC through its Strategy& network reports almost every second car sold will be a battery electric vehicle (BEV), leading to a demand increase for global batteries of 35%. Market growth is being driven by both increased BEV sales and increasing battery size per BEV.

Consequently, PwC says demand for the most relevant active materials, especially lithium, nickel, and graphite will grow steadily.

“We expect an increase from 400,000 up to 6,000,000 tons (by) 2030,” PwC reports.

Shifting dynamics

The economics of lithium are shifting from raw ore to chemicals and active materials. Analysis by PwC’s Strategy& shows the scale-up needed in active material processing is enormous – on the order of multiple magnitudes by 2030 – if Western regions want to localise battery value chains.

Global mining leaders agree another catalyst for the growth of the downstream lithium market will be the shift in government policy for many nations and their willingness to provide incentives for its advancement.

While China currently leads in refining capacity, other regions are making significant strides to enhance their domestic processing capabilities, ensuring a more diversified and resilient global supply chain.

As mentioned, governments and OEMs are pushing for domestic refining, recycling and cathode precursor capacity, and commercial players that secure both feedstock and processing will win the margin pool. Policy instruments (industrial subsidies, content rules, strategic investments) are poised to accelerate regional moves to capture more of the battery value chain.

One example of the emerging recycling segment is Livium’s (ASX:LIT) wholly owned subsidiary Envirostream recently extending its agreement with LG Energy Solution (KRX:373220) for the provision of lithium-ion battery recycling and disposal services for a further three years.

Envirostream will receive guaranteed volumes of end-of-life batteries, which LG retains the right to purchase black mass generated from the batteries. Speaking to Mining.com.au in September, CEO Simon Linge says a large contribution to the agreement extension was Livium’s performance in its duties, which has bolstered the contractual relationship.

“I think we’ve been able to prove that we have been able to support them through the last 18 months and we’re confident that this new agreement, we think, shows that they’re confident in our ability to do that for another three years,” Linge says.

According to Linge, LG plays an effective role in sourcing recalled batteries from the market, for Livium to recycle.

“They are at the back half of that or the back third of that recall program, but as you can imagine, you get an initial surge, and then it’s harder to get the last bit of the tail,” he adds.

“Wanting to extend the agreement just for that tail may go longer than they’d originally expected, but then the broadening of the agreement into non-recall batteries was really just a reflection of the relationship that we built.”

BESS case scenario

As renewables proliferate and electrification grows, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are also set to play a crucial role in a dynamic energy system by smoothing supply and demand peaks and helping defer the cost of grid expansion and upgrades.

Mining.com.au previously reported that BESS deployments in H1 2025 are up 58% over the first six months of 2024. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) September 2025 Resources and Energy Quarterly, notes BESS growth is expected to be at almost 13% a year to 2027 driven primarily by its increasingly important role in electricity grids.

BESS is now also supplying electricity during high demand periods in addition to their existing role in providing grid auxiliary services. Capital is flowing to battery energy storage systems and cell production, but industry insiders tell this news service the pace of investment still falls short of the scale needed to meet some decarbonisation pathways.

That investment gap – and the divergence between announced projects and actually delivered capacity – is the reason downstream players (refiners, cathode makers, recyclers) must plan for serial bottlenecks and secure long-term offtake early, they say.

Chris Ackerman, Corporate Development for Q2 Metals (TSX-V:QTWO), tells Mining.com.au growth in the downstream lithium market is still being driven by EVs and, as mentioned, it appears growth here will continue – particularly as range increases and prices decline.

“But there are other disruptors that are emerging and vying for centre stage, as well. With the advancement of AI and the need for data centres, as well as the need for energy storage capacity for solar and wind (renewables) energy via Battery Energy Storage Systems, will be key drivers moving forward. BESS is needed to store renewable energy/energy grid storage,” Ackerman tells this news service.

Ackerman reiterates that lithium demand is primarily driven by battery applications, which should come as no surprise – somewhere in the 90% range.

“It is primarily associated with electric vehicle batteries which is a major and growing component – but larger grid applications in the form of BESS is poised to be a key growth area,” Ackerman tells this news service.

“Cell phones, laptops, drones – there are innumerable battery applications we use everyday. Rounding it out, there are various other industrial applications as well, whether alloying, glass or even medicinal.”

Some analysts believe a rebound may be on the horizon, fuelled by this renewed growth in EV adoption and clean energy storage. Although lithium prices remain difficult to predict, global lithium miners are once more betting big on the metal.

Brunswick Exploration (TSX-V:BRW) CEO Killian Charles notes, however, EV adoption is actually secondary to renewable power installation. Historically, developed nations had ample access to electric power while developing nations did not.

Renewables and access to electricity, he says, is the key driver in the growth of the market, adding that historically, developed nations have had ample access to electric power while developing nations did not.

“The extreme growth of solar power installation continues unabated. This causes electricity to be available in areas that typically have poor to no EV penetration due to weak or oversaturated grids,” Charles tells this news service from Canada.

“As we increase and unlock more electric power through renewable energy, we effectively scale up demand for lithium ‘products’ be it energy storage or EVs.”

“As we increase and unlock more electric power through renewable energy, we effectively scale up demand for lithium ‘products’ be it energy storage or EVs”

Broadly speaking, Brunswick’s CEO expects a market rebalancing to occur throughout 2026 and into 2027 followed by incentivised pricing in 2028 and beyond. This is largely driven by significant demand growth.

While much has been written about declining EV demand, he tells Mining.com.au this is largely a non-issue. EV sales may be down but so are car sales in general.

“EVs as a proportion of total car sales are still increasing (reaching 25% on a global basis) even if most of these sales are predominantly Chinese driven. Typically, bear markets for commodities are driven by very weak demand growth and, at times, reducing demand. This is not observed in the lithium market,” Charles continues.

“Demand is still forecasted to grow by 12% per annum over the next five years. This is a staggering amount and it remains the fastest growing commodity market.”

By 2030, he expects the market to start to mature. There have been major swings in lithium prices over the past 10-15 years and this has underscored the immaturity of the market where the addition of a single mine or single new battery plant can cause huge imbalances.

“By then, one would expect the overall size of the market to better absorb new assets on the supply or the demand side. Not to say there won’t be swings in the price but they will be considerably dampened,” Charles adds.

Supply chain realignments

China dominates global lithium refining, accounting for a substantial share of processing capacity. However, the US and Europe are making concerted efforts to develop domestic refining capabilities to mitigate reliance on Chinese supply chains. For example, North America is expected to process 59% of its lithium as hydroxide by 2034, up from 43% in 2024.

As Patagonia Lithium (ASX:PL3) Executive Chairman Phil Thomas explains to Mining.com.au, while the lithium market currently faces an oversupply, the trajectory points towards a potential deficit by the early 2030s.

This shift underscores the urgency for continued investment in lithium extraction, technological innovation, and strategic policy support to ensure a stable supply that meets the growing demands of the electric vehicle and energy storage sectors.

Thomas says China maintains its position as the dominant consumer of lithium, driven by aggressive EV production and energy storage initiatives. However, the US is increasing investment in domestic lithium production, exemplified by projects like Thacker Pass, and aims to reduce reliance on imports and strengthen the domestic supply chain.

The US Department of Energy’s 2024 review highlights the need for increased capacity in midstream and upstream sectors to support the growing demand for EV batteries. Thomas notes such government policies and incentives will help drive the sector’s growth.

“Policies like the US Inflation Reduction Act and the European Critical Raw Materials Act are providing financial incentives for EV production, raw material sourcing, and battery manufacturing,” Patagonia’s Executive Chairman continues.

“These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand”

“These initiatives are accelerating the transition to electric mobility and renewable energy, thereby increasing lithium demand. The US Government is converting debt to equity in some projects.”

Countries in Europe are accelerating battery manufacturing and localising supply chains to mitigate import dependencies, which Thomas says is spurred by stringent emissions regulations and green industrial policies.

For example, Europe is accelerating its efforts to establish a self-sufficient lithium supply chain. The European Investment Bank has pre-qualified Vulcan Energy (ASX:VUL) for up to €500 million in debt financing to support its lithium hydroxide production facility in Germany, which aims to produce 24,000 tonnes annually by 2026.

As reported by Mining.com.au, Vulcan has now appointed global technology company ABB (SWX:ABBN) as the main electrical contractor partner for the phase one Lionheart Project in Germany.

Under the contracts, ABB will be responsible for the design, engineering, manufacture, testing, and delivery of the electrical infrastructure systems for the project covering the lithium extraction plant, central lithium plant, and well sites with a combined value of €46 million.

Vulcan CEO Cris Moreno says ABB’s system will be the electrical backbone powering the Lionheart Project. The signing of the contract follows a memorandum of understanding entered into by the companies in April 2024. The partnership is designed to optimise processes, shorten delivery times, and reduce and improve cost performance.

Meanwhile in North America, St-Georges Eco-Mining (CSE:SX) and its partners are evaluating potential spodumene suppliers from across Canada, in relation to its lithium production pilot plant and other metallurgical initiatives.

The pilot plant is designed to produce lithium nitrate and potentially lithium hydroxide, along with various byproducts generated through the company’s proprietary processing technology. The company says several suitors have expressed interest in providing concentrate.

St-Georges’ consortium of partners – Coalia and LiOH Corp – has now received a first shipment of five tonnes of Canadian-sourced spodumene concentrate. Initial work and testing is underway, with received material already processed through the alpha-to-beta transformation stage.

Drivers of growth

In terms of growth, Patagonia’s Thomas reiterates that EV adoption, which is projected to account for 87% of global lithium consumption by 2030, will see regions like China, Europe, and India being dominant. Renewable energy storage will also be a driver of growth.

“Lithium-ion batteries are increasingly integral to energy storage solutions, facilitating the integration of intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind into the grid. This sector is anticipated to grow at a rate of 25% annually through 2030,” Thomas tells this news service.

He adds that battery innovation will contribute to the sector’s expansion. Advancements in battery technologies, such as solid-state batteries and high-nickel/cobalt chemistries, are driving demand for high-purity lithium compounds.

Advancements in refining technologies are enhancing efficiency and sustainability. Companies like Mangrove Lithium are developing modular platforms that directly convert lithium chloride into high-purity lithium hydroxide, reducing operational expenditures by up to 40% compared to conventional methods.

“These innovations aim to enhance energy density, reduce costs, and improve charging times, thereby supporting the broader adoption of EVs and energy storage systems,” Thomas adds.

The BESS is yet to come

Currently the cheapest energy source globally is solar power. While China dominates in solar installation, Brunswick’s CEO notes it remains a global phenomenon with 1GWh of solar power installed every 12 hours (down from 20 hours only 2 years ago) and is broadly mixed across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

“As electrical power becomes more available this increases society’s electrification and incentivises the population to invest in electrical products such as EVs and grid owners into storage capacity,” Charles tells Mining.com.au.

New technologies such as AI or robotics require an incredible new amount of electrical power and will also contribute to the sector’s growth, he adds.

Venari Minerals (ASX:ASE) CEO Matt Healy tends to agree. He says the rapid penetration of renewable energy into Western energy markets has resulted in excess electricity necessitating storage technology. Healy says for this reason, global BESS deployments in H1 2025 are up 58% over the first six months of 2024, making BESS the ‘dark horse’ of lithium demand.

As an example, in August this year GenusPlus (ASX:GNP) began construction at the Merredin Big Battery Project (pictured above), as part of Western Australia’s transition to clean energy for the Wheatbelt and Eastern Goldfields regions.

As a joint project between the privately held Atmos Renewables and Nomad Energy, the 100 megawatt/four-hour Merredin Big Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is expected to be commissioned in October 2026.

With an estimated life of 25 years, the project will make $20,000 per year through the Merredin Battery Community Legacy. Construction is expected to create up to 70 jobs and five jobs in operation, with commitments to locally sourced employment and additional support for First Nations peoples.

“Grid-scale batteries play an important role in our clean energy transition, storing excess energy during the day and discharging it at night – helping to stabilise and strengthen our electricity grid”

Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson says this project will add to the state’s reach in the battery sector, including government-owned batteries in Kwinana and Collie.

“Grid-scale batteries play an important role in our clean energy transition, storing excess energy during the day and discharging it at night – helping to stabilise and strengthen our electricity grid,” Sanderson says.

“Together with new transmission lines, wind, solar, and gas generation where needed, they are important elements of the energy grid of the future.”

The Merredin BESS is a part of the state’s larger scheme to implement more renewable energy projects across the region.

The winning strategies?

Downstream integration will play a significant part in the sector’s expected rise. Owning conversion and refining capability – or tight partnerships with refiners – is poised to move up the margin stack.

Cost and ESG leadership will also be a factor. PwC reports projects that combine low cash costs with credible water, community and emissions credentials will obtain premium access to responsibly oriented offtake partners and capital.

Meanwhile, S&P Global says portfolio optionality – flexibility to supply carbonate versus hydroxide, hard-rock versus brine streams, or to pivot feedstock into recycling when economics favours it will be a winning strategy.

Structured offtake, tolling, and hedging to smooth revenue and de-risk financing in volatile markets.

Looking ahead to 2030, the race is on for profitable scale and regional sovereignty. The lithium sector is unlikely to either revert to a simple boom nor settle into a low-value commodity grind.

Instead, industry sources agree it will bifurcate – a commodity-grade mining cohort supplying feedstock into an increasingly regionalised processing and cell-manufacturing map, and a downstream cohort — refiners, cathode makers, recyclers — that capture disproportionate value.

For investors and corporates, industry sources agree the imperative is clear – secure offtake and processing, demonstrate credible ESG performance, and plan for a volatile price path even as cumulative battery demand through 2030 remains transformative.

Those that can marry geology with chemistry, capital discipline with agile commercial models, and do so in a fractured, geopolitical supply landscape, are likely to lead the charge.

Bidirectional charging enables EV owners to send stored power back to their homes, businesses, and even a utility grid.

“As the impacts of the climate crisis become more severe, from stronger wildfires to more destructive storms, preparation and resilience are essential. Bidirectional charging allows electric vehicle owners to power their homes during a blackout or support the grid during peak demand. In effect, EVs can serve as a ‘mini power plant on wheels,’ helping families and communities maintain access to electricity during emergencies,” said Congresswoman Brownley. “Electric buses equipped with this technology can also supply power to schools, hospitals, and emergency operations centers during outages. Given these far-reaching benefits, my bill ensures this smart, innovative technology becomes more widely available throughout the United States.”

“Electric vehicle batteries can help keep the lights on and make electricity more affordable for everyone, even those who don’t own EVs,” said Ellie Cohen of The Climate Center, a climate and energy policy nonprofit. “To prepare for climate extremes from wildfires to floods, we should look to the batteries in our electric cars, trucks, and buses to avoid blackouts — not polluting fossil fuels. That’s why we support the Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charging Act to make electricity cheaper and more reliable for millions of Americans.”

Background

To strengthen grid resilience and expand clean-energy solutions nationwide, the Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charging Act would:

Direct the U.S. Department of Energy to develop a National Electric Vehicle Bidirectional Charging Roadmap.

Direct the U.S. Department of Energy to establish technical standards for EV manufacturers to ensure uniform bidirectional charging capabilities.

Require that all new electric vehicles manufactured beginning in 2029 be capable of bidirectional charging, unless exempted by the Secretary of Energy.

Direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to require that state and local hazard mitigation plans incorporate bidirectional charging capabilities.

The Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charging Act is endorsed by The Climate Center and Récolte Energy.

On November 17, 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule that would significantly narrow its regulatory authority over Waters of the United States (WOTUS). Under the new proposed WOTUS rule, EPA would effectively have jurisdiction only over relatively permanent waters and a smaller subset of directly connected wetlands.

The WOTUS definition outlines the geographic reach of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ and EPA’s authority under the 1972 Clean Water Act to regulate streams, wetlands, and other water bodies. As such, it has been reviewed in boardrooms, courtrooms, and government offices for over fifty years. Most recently, on May 25, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Sackett v. EPA. In Sackett, the Supreme Court determined that WOTUS are only (1) relatively permanent bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams; or (2) adjacent wetlands indistinguishable from those waters because of a continuous surface connection.

EPA frames its proposed WOTUS rule as “fully implementing” Sackett v. EPA and narrowing federal reach. Most importantly, the proposal:

Defines “relatively permanent waters” to include waters that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.

Narrows the definition of “tributary” to only include relatively permanent waters.

Codifies Sackett’s “continuous surface connection” language as it relates to wetlands by requiring the proposed WOTUS wetland to:

Abut a jurisdictional water; and

Have surface water at least during the wet season such that the wetland is effectively indistinguishable from the jurisdictional water.

If the rule is finalized as proposed, many seasonal streams, ephemeral channels, isolated wetlands, and interstate waters will be excluded from federal jurisdiction unless they meet the new “relatively permanent” and “continuous surface connection” tests. That likely means fewer Clean Water Act permits will be required for projects affecting those features. The proposed WOTUS rule will also require EPA to defer more frequently to states and tribes regarding decisions affecting waterways. EPA touts this as “cooperative federalism,” explaining that states and tribes will have more responsibility to decide whether and how to regulate waters no longer overseen by EPA.

Responses to the proposed WOTUS rule are mixed. Many in the regulated community — such as those involved in agriculture, development, and mining — are treating the proposed WOTUS rule as a win because they see it as more predictable and less burdensome. On the other hand, environmental groups argue that the proposed WOTUS rule weakens water quality protections beyond what Sackett requires, leaving wetlands and ephemeral streams unprotected and heightening risks to drinking water, habitat, and flood resilience.

Once the proposed WOTUS rule is published in the Federal Register, interested parties have 45 days to comment. EPA will consider these public comments before issuing a final rule.

Given the history of WOTUS, it is almost guaranteed the final rule will be challenged in court. EPA’s proposal signals another shift in the scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction — and continued uncertainty for projects that interact with wetlands and streams. Project proponents should continue to consult early with counsel and technical experts to assess whether certain features qualify as WOTUS, what permits may still be required, and how best to navigate the shifting balance of federal, state, and tribal regulation.",https://www.swlaw.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2024/04/cropped-Favicon_310x310-32x32.png.webp,N,,2025-11-19 19:01:57.523658

Gov. Tina Kotek wants state agencies to move faster to address climate change, ensure more longterm renewable energy power that is cheap and reliable for Oregonians and fill in gaps from federal disinvestment from clean energy projects.

To do so, Kotek on Wednesday issued an executive order directing state agencies to speed up energy project permitting and processes to connect renewable energy to the state’s electric grid for the long haul.

She called on more than a dozen state land and natural resource agencies to collaborate on strategies by September 2026 that will lead to policy proposals for the Legislature to take up in 2027. They must advance the state’s target of reducing greenhouse gas pollution 50% by 2035 and 90% by 2050, as established in a 2021 executive order by former Gov. Kate Brown.

Agencies will provide quarterly progress updates, Kotek said.

In October, she ordered agencies to fast-track permitting and siting reviews and approvals before July 4, so projects eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s federal clean energy tax cuts can benefit before they expire. For wind and solar projects to receive up to a 50% credit, they must be finished by Dec. 31, 2027.

President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans are phasing out those tax credits via the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

In her latest order, Kotek said agencies will create policies guided by the latest Oregon Energy Strategy, which prioritizes deployment of more solar, wind, geothermal and wave energy projects, energy storage projects, and energy efficiency policies. Those policies include cash incentives that make it more affordable to replace gas cars, buses, furnaces and appliances with electric ones, electrify heating and cooling systems and make homes and businesses more energy-efficient and comfortable in hot or cold weather.

The plan also calls on reforming project siting and permitting for electrical grid upgrades and transmission corridors, making analysis, review and comment periods faster and opening up more state land for such projects.

A recent investigation from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica found the Northwest is woefully behind other parts of the country in adding new sources of renewable energy, because Oregon and Washington have left most of the grid transmission work to the federal Bonneville Power Administration. The administration has left parts of the region’s grid without updates for nearly a century, and the agency has been glacial in deploying and integrating new energy projects, the investigation found.

Kotek said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon that she wants BPA leaders to make good on promises they made when she took office to collaborate with the state on its energy future.

“I’m going to keep pushing BPA for grid enhancements, and pushing back on BPA on poor upgrades,” she said. “BPA needs to be a better partner.”

The state energy strategy also calls for the state to add 8 gigawatts of energy storage by 2045 — about 50% more than currently exists. But Kotek said nearly 7 of those gigawatts are already planned for development, enough to power roughly 5.8 million homes.

Agency collabs

The Department of Environmental Quality and the three-member Public Utility Commission will work together to ensure revenue collected by the utilities through the state’s Clean Fuels Program is invested in strategic areas. Those include transportation electrification and infrastructure in low-income communities, at multifamily housing sites and areas lacking commercial EV chargers.

The Clean Fuels Program requires fossil fuels suppliers, such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil, to gradually reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from the fuels they sell in Oregon until they’ve cut emissions at least 37% by 2035. Clean fuels producers in the program, such as companies installing electric vehicle charging stations, can earn carbon credits from DEQ and sell them to fossil fuels producers to help offset some of their emissions.

Kotek is also calling for the carbon intensity of fuels to be reduced 50% or more by 2040. This means they must switch to or blend into their products biofuels — such as corn ethanol and fuels made with food waste — or switch to other fuels that emit less carbon dioxide when burned, providing hydrogen or electricity for traditional gas vehicles.

She directed the Department of Administrative Services to buy zero-emission vehicles for state agencies and report to the governor at the end of each year on why it bought or leased any new combustion-engine vehicles.

The Department of Land Conservation and Development will research and propose changes to state land planning goals and regulations to boost clean energy development and create more transmission corridors on public lands.

Given budget constraints, including a deficit of at least $63 million during the next 18 months according to the latest state revenue forecast, Kotek said she expects agencies to “do what they can with existing resources” and to identify funding challenges and needs for the next two-year budget cycle.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solarwind2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:01:05.052401

But they are likely to face stiff opposition from petrostates such as Saudi Arabia and others who are dependent on fossil fuels.
“Not only is [the divide] binary, but it is two extremes: one very favourable [to a phaseout] the other very unfavourable.
Some oil-producing countries oppose the fossil fuel phaseout, but so do some consumer countries.
“They have to decide by themselves how they interpret the transition [away from fossil fuels],” he said.","Oil-producing countries need to acknowledge the rise of clean energy, and rich countries will have to provide more assurances on finance if the chasm between negotiating nations at Cop30 is to be bridged, the president of the summit has said.

André Corrêa do Lago, the veteran Brazilian climate diplomat in charge of the talks, said: “Developing countries are looking at developed countries as countries that could be much more generous in supporting them to be more sustainable. They could offer more finance, and technology.”

This does not necessarily involve an increase in the headline amount of money to be provided directly from rich world coffers, set last year at $300bn (£230bn) a year by 2035. It could also come from better use of existing finance, Corrêa do Lago added.

“You don’t need more money. You don’t need public money from developed countries. You need to leverage more dollars from each dollar that you have,” he said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian as the talks entered their crucial stage.

“They can offer not only more resources in banks, in multinational development banks; put more public money in funds like the green climate fund or the global environment facility, but there are an increasing number of alternatives like debt-for-nature swaps and other [instruments].”

The divide over the “transition away from fossil fuels” has emerged as the biggest faultline at the Cop30 talks, now entering their final days in Brazil. On Tuesday, more than 80 countries demanded a roadmap to the transition as a key outcome of the summit, in what some campaigners described as a “turning point”.

But they are likely to face stiff opposition from petrostates such as Saudi Arabia and others who are dependent on fossil fuels. Decisions at “conference of the party” meetings require consensus, so even a handful of states could scupper the roadmap proposal.

“Not only is [the divide] binary, but it is two extremes: one very favourable [to a phaseout] the other very unfavourable. There aren’t many countries that are indifferent,” said Corrêa do Lago.

But countries could still come together, he added. “Like most of these negotiations, it is less binary than it looks,” he said, if countries could recognise their own internal contradictions, and face up to the global need for climate action.

Some oil-producing countries oppose the fossil fuel phaseout, but so do some consumer countries. “Some countries, because oil is a very important source of revenue, and other countries because they evaluate that they still need to use coal for more years, have shown very clearly that this proposal is not acceptable to them,” Corrêa do Lago said.

Oil-producing countries also had hard truths to face up to. “They have to decide by themselves how they interpret the transition [away from fossil fuels],” he said. “They are already doing it. There is one statistic that shows that the use of oil will be reduced inevitably in the years ahead. [Electric vehicles are] reducing significantly the demand for oil, for gasoline and diesel.”

He urged all countries to examine their future in the context of the climate crisis. “All countries could engage in this exercise, which is to find its own path to transition towards net zero, which is what we have committed to,” he said.

Countries can get over their internal contradictions, and take action on the climate in spite of them, according to Corrêa do Lago. Brazil embodies this: the country has recently become a major producer of oil and gas, but its president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has repeatedly insisted, at Cop30 and the summit of world leaders in Belém that preceded it, on the need to “move away from dependency on fossil fuels”.

Countries should face up to these opposing internal forces rather than try to hide them, Corrêa do Lago urged. “This Cop is happening in a country that is at the same time a nouveau oil producer and exporter, and the champion of renewables.

“The country where you have the largest tropical forests in the world and the country that has the largest meat producer in the world. Brazil is a microcosm of the world: we have many successes, and we still have great challenges [with poverty] and many things to do to improve the life of our population. We understand the challenges of wealth and the challenges of poverty. [Brazil] reminds us that every country in the world has contradictory circumstances.”

Lula is expected to return to Belém on Wednesday in an attempt to draw conflicted countries together. Corrêa do Lago said this would be done by listening to all countries’ concerns. “Brazil doesn’t want to do a top-down negotiation – Brazil wants to hear from countries which solutions they propose,” he said.

Corrêa do Lago is a pragmatist, a climate diplomat since 2002 who believes the annual talks must evolve fast to keep up with the speed at which global heating is altering the planet. Arguments over the precise wording of promises and resolutions that have been rehearsed many times before can distract countries from the need to pursue action in the real world, he says.

“The sense of urgency is what drove us to insist on implementation, because I think at this stage it’s irrelevant to be right. What is relevant is really to advance and make progress in implementation,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ca8f77e6f90cb7a652721ad8150de660cc433c/620_0_2813_2250/master/2813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=085c4863eb48f04c4f3ae883c89ecf77",N,,2025-11-19 19:58:42.723626

CCME Executive Director Charles McConnell delivered the presentation “Energy Transformation: Winds of Change,” emphasizing the essential role of engineering, carbon management, and execution excellence in enabling lower-carbon energy systems and sustaining industrial competitiveness. CCME’s involvement reflected the Forum’s central message: the success of the energy transition depends not only on technological innovation, but also on the effectiveness of project financing, contracting, and execution.

Notable sessions were held on such topics as EPC risk allocation, modularization strategies, supply-chain resilience, and the integration of carbon capture into large-scale industrial assets. These discussions underscored the growing need for practical, scalable solutions that balance cost, performance, and emissions reduction and reinforced the importance of disciplined project development, an approach that aligns closely with CCME’s research priorities and its ongoing collaborations with industry partners.

Zhiyuan Li, UH PhD student in Petroleum Engineering, also represented CCME and engaged with EPC executives, technology developers, and project managers throughout the event. “The Forum offered a valuable perspective on how engineering decisions, economic considerations, and carbon-reduction objectives converge in real project execution,” Li said. “It was insightful to see how CCUS and low-carbon technologies are evaluated not only technically, but also in terms of schedule certainty, supply-chain complexity, and contracting strategy. The discussions also highlighted how diverse industries—from surface-facility engineering to data centers to pump manufacturers—play interconnected roles in enabling large-scale carbon-management solutions.”

For CCME, the event was a great opportunity to gain an important perspective on how industry views first-of-a-kind (FOAK) low-carbon deployments. Discussions at the Forum emphasized the need for stronger partnerships between technology developers, EPC firms, and research institutions to reduce risk and accelerate commercial adoption. These insights align directly with CCME’s mission to serve as a bridge between academic research and industry implementation, ensuring that carbon-management technologies are both scientifically robust and commercially deployable.

“The loss of federal funding for clean energy projects threatens much needed years of progress toward a more sustainable future,” he said.","Hawaii’s Legislature may want to consider offering new state tax-credit funding for renewable energy expansion to at least partially offset federal withdrawals.

That was a suggestion made to a pair of state Senate committee chairs during a briefing last week about negative impacts on Hawaii climate change mitigation initiatives due to recent federal policy changes and funding pullbacks.

Leah Laramee, coordinator of the Hawai‘i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission, told Sens. Karl Rhoads and Mike Gabbard at the Nov. 3 briefing that it would be incredibly helpful if more local tax credits were made available for renewable energy and climate change impact mitigation projects in the face of federal cutbacks driven by the administration of President Donald Trump.

Laramee told the senators that about $651 million in Hawaii renewable energy projects are at risk due to federal policy and funding changes.

“It’s a significant investment that is threatened in the state,” she said. “The loss of these projects is going to have pretty significant impacts on our ability to produce affordable energy locally and impact our energy security.”

In recent weeks, the administration of Gov. Josh Green has rolled out state emergency funding programs to help low-income households in Hawaii pay for rent, utilities and food to counteract federal program cuts due to the government shutdown. Most recently, the state Department of Transportation offered to pay federal air traffic and security workers to avoid curtailing flights at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu by 10%.

Though the loss of federal financial support for renewable energy isn’t on par with shutdown-related emergency responses, Hawaii residents and businesses pay the highest electricity rates in the nation. The threat of rising sea levels on the local economy also makes climate change impact mitigation a high priority for state leaders.

Some of the $651 million in threatened Hawaii renewable energy projects cannot be offset by state funding, such as a planned offshore wind farm where federal officials have ceased regulatory approval action. But state funding could counter canceled federal support for other things including electric vehicles, rooftop solar systems and “carbon smart” food production.

Laramee told Rhoads and Gabbard, who respectively chair the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Environment, that one of the biggest federal grant losses for Hawaii was $249 million from a $3 billion nationwide U.S. Department of Agriculture program called Carbon Smart Commodities.

The program supported climate-friendly agricultural projects including development of food forests, invasive species management and soil health improvement.

“This is really about food security within the state, and that’s been rescinded,” Laramee said.

Another move earlier this year rescinded a $62.5 million federal grant used to make low-cost loans for low- and moderate-income households to pay for rooftop solar systems.

This Solar for All program was being operated by the Hawai‘i Green Infrastructure Authority, but was terminated in August by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Hawaii along with nearly two dozen other states filed lawsuits in October challenging EPA’s rescission of grant funding approved by Congress. Laramee said she was optimistic that the state will prevail, and encouraged the Legislature to keep up support for the state Office of the Attorney General, which is involved in numerous lawsuits over federal policy and funding changes.

Laramee also suggested that loan repayment revenue received by the Green Infrastructure Authority be recycled to fund more loans instead of being deposited into the state’s general fund.

The briefing held by Rhoads and Gabbard also covered ongoing efforts to invest in plans and projects that make Hawaii more resilient to rising sea level and temperatures — efforts that include pending litigation by the City and County of Honolulu against major oil companies that the Trump Administration has tried to upend.

Retired Hawaii Supreme Court justice Michael Wilson urged state leaders to develop a climate protection plan for the islands. Such a plan, he told Rhoads and Gabbard, could start with guarding against the loss of Waikiki Beach, which Wilson said stands to be submerged in 40 or 50 years based on the present rate of global warming impacts and would sap $2 billion of annual visitor spending.

After the briefing, Rhoads (D, Nuuanu-Downtown-Iwilei) said in a statement that the presentations by Laramee and Wilson were a sobering reminder that climate change isn’t a distant or abstract issue, and that it directly impacts the health, safety, and economic future of Hawaii residents.

“Our responsibility as lawmakers is to take proactive measures to protect our communities and uphold the rights of future generations to a safe and sustainable environment,” Rhoads said.

Gabbard (D, Kapolei-­Makakilo-Kalaeloa) said in a statement that now is the time to “double down” on the commitment by Hawaii leaders to renewable energy, local food security and climate adaptation to safeguard our islands.

“The loss of federal funding for clean energy projects threatens much needed years of progress toward a more sustainable future,” he said.

Poorly crafted federal preemption and blanket moratoriums on state AI laws in the absence of federal standards are dangerous approaches.","Introduction and summary

On November 17, 2025, House Republican leaders were reported to be actively considering preemption of state AI laws, with an eye on the National Defense Authorization Act as the possible legislative vehicle.1 President Donald Trump took to Truth Social the next day to amplify the message, claiming that AI investment has made the U.S. economy the “hottest” in the world—despite current economic realities2—and that state overregulation threatens to derail this supposed growth.3 This renewed push comes on the heels of a failed attempt by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)4 to insert a dangerous5 and overreaching6 moratorium on state laws regulating AI into the Senate budget reconciliation package, the Big Beautiful Bill (BBB).7 While the BBB did pass,8 senators ultimately voted 99-1 to strike the state AI law moratorium from the bill.9 The moratorium ultimately failed due to serious drafting flaws and procedural issues,10 including efforts to contort the proposal to meet Senate reconciliation rules and the use of vague language by Sen. Cruz’s team that expanded the provision’s reach11 beyond what it publicly claimed.12 Despite the removal of the moratorium from the BBB, federal preemption proposals or temporary moratoriums on state AI laws remain a critical legislative policy discussion. Such actions remain a top priority for the AI industry13 and the Trump administration, which mentions fears about “states with burdensome AI regulations” in its AI Action Plan.14 For the largest tech firms, the goal is not simply regulatory clarity but also to help shape a more permissive legal environment for AI development and deployment.15 Influential AI policy thinkers on the right also continue to refine and promote the idea of a federal moratorium.16 Critically, the proposal for a federal moratorium on state AI laws failed17 not because almost all U.S. senators oppose a ban on state AI laws but due to the circumstances of how it was crafted to meet the rules of reconciliation. Sen. Cruz has already pledged to reintroduce the proposal elsewhere and included in his September 2025 release of “A Legislative Framework for American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,”18 alongside his proposed SANDBOX Act,19 to allow the suspension of any federal rules and regulations AI companies identify as inhibiting their ability to develop and deploy AI.

In this report, the author uses the term “reconciliation moratorium” to refer specifically to the House and Senate versions of a moratorium on state AI laws that were introduced as part of the BBB, with the understanding that if a moratorium had passed, it would have blocked most AI laws in any state it applied to.

With a legislative proposal on federal preemption or a moratorium on state AI laws likely to return, it is critical that Congress recognize the public safeguards states provide and the risk such interventions could pose to entrench industry power by undermining state regulatory authority. Rather than blocking state action, lawmakers should focus on setting a strong federal floor of protections, including prohibitions on the most dangerous uses of AI, while preserving state authority to go further in addressing new harms. At a minimum, any effort to limit state laws should be subject to extended deliberation that fully considers the tradeoffs and ensures that any preemption is paired with meaningful and enforceable federal protections.

Background on the reconciliation AI moratorium fight

The reconciliation AI moratorium was first introduced20 in the House21 as a standalone provision that would apply nationwide and included a narrow exemption for criminal laws. Sen. Ted Cruz later introduced a nearly identical version in the Senate that also applied broadly to all state and local AI laws and omitted the criminal law exemption.22 Although Cruz’s version made a passing reference to Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) funding, it was still functionally standalone in its scope and effect.23 This “standalone” structure meant that the ban would take effect as binding federal law regardless of whether a state accepted the new BEAD funds. After the Senate parliamentarian raised concerns,24 Cruz revised the language25 to tie enforcement more explicitly to BEAD-related funding. However, as CAP explained at the time,26 the revised text still applied a blanket ban on state and local AI regulation and extended enforcement beyond just the $500 million addition, likely implicating the full $42.5 billion BEAD program. Continued backlash over that ambiguity led to another revision27 and a five-year compromise28 amendment cosponsored by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).29 Sen. Blackburn ultimately opposed her amendment and the AI moratorium due to concerns about the provision’s real-world impact, stating, “This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives. Until Congress passes federally preemptive legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act and an online privacy framework, we can’t block states from making laws that protect their citizens.”30 Senators ultimately voted 99-1 to strike the AI moratorium31 from the BBB before passing it.32

Federal preemption—including temporary moratoriums—of state AI laws is a nightmare to craft and enforce

Proposals to block state AI laws are likely to return. Some may mirror the reconciliation moratorium by relying on temporary bans or tying restrictions to funding. However, if revived, those efforts would likely fall outside the confines of budget reconciliation legislation and require 60 votes in the Senate to pass, necessitating bipartisan cooperation. Other proposals may take a different route and pursue permanent federal preemption of state AI laws. While both approaches aim to restrict state power, they operate differently in law. Federal preemption replaces state statutes with federal ones under the supremacy clause, while a moratorium only pauses state authority for a limited time without permanently nullifying existing laws or requiring a federal standard in their place.

Federal preemption of state laws is not unprecedented and can be appropriate in some cases, but well-structured examples are narrowly tailored and often paired with strong federal protections. In climate policy, the Clean Air Act provides a model where federal standards establish a baseline and states retain the authority to adopt stronger protections.33 Several efforts in the broader tech policy space illustrate how preemption can be structured more thoughtfully. In recent years, proposed federal legislation to address data privacy—the American Data Privacy Protection Act34 and the American Privacy Rights Act35—sought to establish comprehensive federal privacy standards by preempting only certain state privacy laws36 while preserving others that reflect consumer protections and civil rights.37 Proponents of preemption of state AI laws frequently point to38 the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA),39 which narrowly and clearly preempted state taxation on internet access. However, the reconciliation moratorium shared little in common with ITFA’s targeted scope. ITFA addressed a well-defined activity, taxation, with explicit guidelines and a sunset provision.

While the reconciliation moratorium was not structured as federal preemption in the traditional sense, its practical effect would have mirrored a broad preemption regime by overriding state authority across a wide range of policy domains. What made this especially dangerous is that, unlike traditional preemption frameworks, the moratorium offered no federal protections in return. It did not establish minimum standards, create oversight mechanisms, or provide any substantive safeguards for the public. Because of this, it is useful to examine the moratorium as a case study of how poorly scoped federal interventions in state authority—whether through federal preemption or temporary moratoriums—can undermine effective governance and generate legal confusion.

The reconciliation moratorium sought to broadly prevent states from regulating entire classes of AI applications across sensitive and diverse sectors such as employment, health care, housing, and elections—many of which are areas in which states have significant equities and long histories of promulgating regulations—for a period of five or 10 years. A decade-long freeze on state AI laws is also excessive by any measure. Ten years ago, there were no transformer models and no large language models, and there was no public understanding of how AI could reshape communication, labor, or information ecosystems. Since then, the field has seen the rapid rise of large-scale language models and the early development of AI agents capable of acting with increasing autonomy across digital environments. Now, leaders in the tech industry are publicly projecting that40 artificial general intelligence could emerge within the very decade that the reconciliation moratorium would have shut states out of legislating. Even the revised five-year compromise amendment41 introduced by Sens. Cruz and Blackburn, while slightly less extreme, would have still posed serious risks. That is because any attempt to suspend state authority in this fast-evolving space, whether for five years or 10, is dangerous if not paired with a federal floor of basic safeguards.

The reconciliation moratorium attempted to prohibit state and local governments from not only passing new laws or regulations that “limit,” “restrict,” or “regulate” AI but also from enforcing existing ones for the duration of the ban, while allowing those laws and regulations that “facilitate” AI. Although the exact phrasing varied slightly, the terms “regulate” and “facilitate” appeared consistently across the versions introduced in both the House and Senate. Efforts to block only restrictive AI laws while allowing those seen as supportive made the provision especially difficult to interpret, which in turn would have made consistent enforcement nearly impossible. A blanket moratorium that banned all state AI laws, whether they limit or facilitate AI, would have been more straightforward to administer. This highlights the core challenge with overriding state authority in this space because there is no approach that is both simple and neutral if it comes at the cost of eliminating the ability of states to respond to rapidly changing risks, and applies not only to future legislation but also to existing laws.

The definitions used in the reconciliation moratorium were also deeply flawed. Terms such as “AI system,” “model,” and “automated decision system” were written so broadly42 that they could apply to virtually any computational tool.43 Whether these ambiguities were intentional or accidental remains unclear. What is clear is that such ambiguous language invites lawsuits and regulatory paralysis, particularly because the reconciliation moratorium allowed private entities, not just the federal government,44 to bring enforcement actions. As a result, states would face the risk of being tied up in costly litigation for years, unable to advance legislation without legal challenge.

Even if a future AI moratorium were rewritten to limit enforcement to the federal government, it would create a different kind of barrier. States would be forced to seek clarity or approval from the government before acting, placing them in a constant position of uncertainty. This would function less like guidance and more like a de facto preclearance system, where state lawmakers hesitate to act out of concern that federal officials could later reinterpret compliance standards or that a change in administration could bring a different view of what is allowed, putting previously lawful state efforts in jeopardy.

Another key concern arises when there is no exemption for criminal laws. The House version45 of the reconciliation moratorium included a carve-out to preserve states’ ability to enforce their criminal codes, but the Senate version removed that protection. Without an exemption for criminal laws, states would be blocked from prosecuting serious AI-related crimes. For instance, Utah recently enacted H.B. 0238,46 a law that expands the definition of child sexual abuse material to explicitly include AI-generated imagery. Under the Senate’s version of the reconciliation moratorium, laws such as H.B. 0238 could have been preempted. This omission could have interfered with efforts to protect children and to address a range of AI-enabled criminal activity, including identity fraud, election interference, and the production of nonconsensual or exploitative synthetic media.

Constitutional concerns

Beyond the practical flaws of the reconciliation moratorium, a ban on state AI laws raises serious constitutional questions. Under the Tenth Amendment, powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government remain with the states. This means that states possess core authorities such as running elections, regulating state courts, setting the rules for the administration of their own state government, licensing professionals, and protecting public health and safety. The reconciliation moratorium did not carve out exceptions for these areas. Instead, it unconstitutionally imposed a sweeping prohibition that would have invalidated all forms of state AI laws that sought to restrict AI. For example, it would have prevented state legislatures from setting rules on how their own judiciaries use AI to draft opinions or review filings, an issue squarely within state control.

Many of the first laws governing AI have emerged in precisely these domains. States have already adopted laws specifically targeting AI use to ensure the integrity of their elections.47 For example, Minnesota and Texas ban48 the use of political deepfakes within certain timeframes before an election. In regulating courtroom practices, states have also taken steps to protect their courts from AI-related abuses. Texas’ 30th District Court, for instance, requires legal filings to include an “AI certificate”49 confirming that AI tools were not used to fabricate evidence or citations. The text of the reconciliation moratorium arguably would have preempted those statutes in ways that infringe on state sovereignty, removing state control over their internal operations and undermining their constitutionally protected role.

The push for a moratorium or preemption is industry-driven

Large AI companies and their trade associations50 have called for federal preemption of state AI laws in their submissions to the White House’s AI Action Plan51 as documented in the public AI Action Plan database.52 Following these requests, Big Tech companies and their trade groups53 supported and lobbied for the moratorium’s inclusion in the reconciliation bill.54 The reconciliation moratorium reflects this effort, aligning closely with industry demands.

Support for preemption or a moratorium is not limited to large companies. Some smaller AI firms, including signatories to letters submitted to the AI Action Plan,55 have voiced concerns about the cost and complexity of complying with different state laws. While these concerns may not be baseless, it would be misleading to suggest that a moratorium would primarily benefit smaller players. Large technology companies would stand to gain just as much, if not more. These larger players have the resources to manage a patchwork of state laws, but they see compliance with them as a burden that slows development and limits their freedom to deploy systems on their own terms. That is why they are likely demanding preemption not solely out of principle or concern for startup burdens, but because regulatory friction threatens their market dominance. Preemption would reduce the scrutiny they face at the state level and shield their models and practices from accountability. It is crucial, then, that in any debate over federal preemption, it is clear who is asking for it, who stands to gain, and what will be lost if states are pushed out of the AI governance space.

State leadership should be protected

The United States still lacks comprehensive federal laws governing AI and privacy. In response, states have stepped forward to begin to protect their residents. Many lawmakers acted swiftly, drawing lessons from Congress’ failure to pass meaningful privacy legislation despite years of debate. They understood that delay at the federal level often means no safeguards at all. Rather than wait, states, which have long been the laboratory of American democracy, advanced laws that promote transparency, prevent abuse, and restrict dangerous uses of AI in sectors such as employment, housing, and health care.

That same balance should guide federal AI policymaking. While the single best way to regulate AI may not yet be known, it is clear that doing nothing is not the answer.

These state efforts are critical because they allow for policy experimentation, developing best practices that can later inform federal legislation. States are uniquely positioned to respond quickly to emerging harms and to tailor policy to local needs. Across policy areas, states have taken a range of approaches that reflect their local priorities and levels of risk tolerance. Some, such as Utah, have opted for light-touch models such as regulatory sandboxes that allow innovation while monitoring outcomes. Others, such as Colorado and California, have passed more comprehensive AI accountability laws that establish transparency and oversight mechanisms.56 In climate policy, California used the authority preserved for the states under the Clean Air Act to adopt stronger protections57 and lead on vehicle emissions policy, including the Advanced Clean Cars and Advanced Clean Trucks programs. Until recently, those policies were backed by a federal waiver, which enabled California to impose stricter standards than the national baseline and have since been adopted by more than a dozen other states.58 That same balance should guide federal AI policymaking. While the single best way to regulate AI may not yet be known, it is clear that doing nothing is not the answer. Allowing multiple approaches from states to coexist increases the chances of identifying what works, what needs adjustment, and what should be scaled nationally. That flexibility is especially important in a field such as AI, where the technology evolves faster than Congress tends to legislate.

Industry has long warned about the “risk” or “costs” of a fragmented patchwork of state laws. But those same companies have often been the first to oppose serious federal proposals—particularly comprehensive privacy bills59—that would have unified standards and granted them the very preemption they now claim is necessary. The result is a landscape where the patchwork is not a byproduct of overzealous state action but a direct consequence of industry obstruction at the federal level. In that context, state leadership is not a bug but a feature of the system. The United States has long treated states as laboratories of democracy, giving them the freedom to pilot new solutions.

The result of companies opposing federal AI policymaking is a landscape where the patchwork of state laws is not a byproduct of overzealous state action but a direct consequence of industry obstruction at the federal level.

In practice, real legal conflict across states is often what prompts Congress to act. When courts reached conflicting decisions in the 1990s about liability for online platforms, that tension helped Congress create Section 23060 to resolve the conflicting issues. If state AI laws ever generate similar conflicts that create true uncertainty for national compliance, federal lawmakers will face strong pressure to intervene. That is how the system is designed to function.

Federal AI policy should build on state progress

Congress should not be focused on blocking the limited protections that currently exist at the state level, particularly since few have actually come into effect. Instead, it should focus on establishing foundational federal policies that start with prohibiting the most dangerous abuses of AI and creating guardrails for responsible use for higher-risk applications. As part of that work, Congress should learn from the states. Some of the most urgent safeguards, including prohibitions on abusive surveillance, algorithmic discrimination, and algorithmic pricing, have already begun to take shape at the state level and are likely to continue expanding as more states act. For example, New Hampshire and Oregon have passed laws banning the use of real-time remote biometric identification for surveillance in public spaces by law enforcement without a warrant,61 and five states have introduced bills to curb surveillance pricing.62 Preserving space for state experimentation and leadership is essential to building a governance model that is both protective and adaptive. Lawmakers can start by calling in state officials who have already passed AI laws to testify, offering insights into what is working and where challenges remain, something they never did when passing the reconciliation moratorium. Federal legislation to prohibit specific, high-risk uses of AI may be called for to ensure consistent protections across jurisdictions.

A comprehensive federal privacy law is also a necessary starting point, both because privacy is a fundamental human right that deserves robust protection and because privacy safeguards determine what data can be collected and used in the first place.63 AI systems are only as safe and fair as the inputs they are trained on. Without clear rules for how data are collected, shared, and governed, even the most carefully crafted AI policies will fall short.

Conclusion

The reconciliation AI moratorium proposed in the BBB may have ultimately been scuttled, but the broader effort under the Trump administration to assert federal control over AI policy is just beginning—and House Republican leaders have already confirmed they are actively seeking new avenues to impose a moratorium on state AI laws.64 Congress has an important role to play in setting national rules for AI, but that work should not start by pushing states aside. Strong federal protections are necessary and can be put in place without cutting off efforts from the states that are already underway across the country. States are moving forward with real policies that respond to real problems, and blocking those efforts would not create clarity. It would slow progress, protect industry interests, and silence the only voices trying to keep this technology accountable. Poorly crafted federal preemption and blanket moratoriums on state AI laws in the absence of federal standards are dangerous approaches. Congress should reject any push to centralize control at the expense of state power.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2236950552-CROPPED.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 22:58:31.786694

This uncertainty has made project planning more challenging for professionals in architecture and construction.

Construction cost estimation is a “losing battle” these days, Rachel Smith-Streck, director of strategy and partner at TAP Architecture in Oklahoma City said.

“Just in general, tariffs are affecting everything, so you can’t pinpoint your target,” Smith-Streck said. “Usually, we can do some cost estimation, but now it’s a losing battle. What we think the numbers are going to be when we get to working with the construction team, who has a real job to do, [the cost] is over here,” she said, gesturing up, “and we thought it was right here,” gesturing down.

The impending expiration or reduction of several commercial and residential tax credits for HVAC and renewable energy sources at the end of the year are also raising final construction costs, Smith-Streck said.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, which passed in July, cut several tax credits aimed at encouraging long-term investment in energy efficiency and clean energy. These tax credits were implemented as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and were originally set to be phased out in 2032.

On Dec. 31, the full 30% credit offered through the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit expires, leaving only the 6% base credit through 2028, before it is phased out entirely. The ITC applies to the cost of commercial installations of qualifying energy systems, including solar, storage, geothermal, fuel cells and wind.

“I know the expiration is coming up, and that’s going to be a challenge, mainly because [geothermal] is something we always push if our client can do it,” Smith-Streck said. “If you can afford that upfront cost, it’s way better, but obviously, now that you don’t have those credits either, that’s going to be a challenge.”

Smith-Streck said TAP Architecture is working with Mid-America Christian University on a project now, and they’re considering a geothermal energy system.

“When we’re thinking about their project, if they can buy that in the beginning of a new build, it’s going to save them money in the long run, because they’re going to keep that building forever,” Smith-Streck said. “It’ll be easy to maintain, and it’ll be cheaper to run, but if you can’t afford it, the tax credits aren’t [going to be] there that helps some of our clients afford it. That’s a difficult thing.”

Auto supply chain has weak links Last month, Honda Motor was the first automaker to indicate its production was impacted by the chips dispute.
Volkswagen indicated at that time that it only had about a week's supply left of semiconductor chips before its production could be affected.
That's why, while this pause is a small step toward a resolution, it is still welcomed news in the auto industry, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.
""With the trade tensions currently disrupting the global supply chain, any easing is a good sign,"" Fiorani told the Detroit Free Press.","Detroit's auto industry is closely watching the latest development in an impending semiconductor chip crisis to see if the issue is resolved and the industry can exhale ― or if it leads to a bigger dearth of semiconductor chips that brings new vehicle production to a halt.

On Nov. 19, the Dutch government said it was suspending its intervention at computer chip maker Nexperia because of 'constructive talks' with China. The Dutch government has been in a dispute with China for several weeks now, which has led to shortages of chips used by carmakers in a variety of car parts.

The dispute stems from the Dutch government taking control at Nexperia on Sept. 30 on the grounds that it had to do so to prevent the company's former chief executive from moving operations to China. In reaction, China stopped all exports of Nexperia's finished products on Oct. 4. China has since relaxed that export halt a bit.

According to Reuters, Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans said suspending the government intervention was a gesture of goodwill as the conversations continue.

""We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,"" he said in a statement in Reuters.

It's good news for Detroit's car companies and the rest of the auto industry as many carmakers are reported to have set up ""war rooms"" to monitor and mitigate the chips shortage to keep it from causing too much disruption to new-car production.

Detroit's history with chips

The last thing the Detroit automakers want is a repeat of the COVID-caused semiconductor chip shortage in 2021, which led to thousands of unfinished vehicles sitting in parking lots across the country awaiting chips to complete production and ship to dealers.

So news of progress in the talks between the Dutch and Chinese governments was a welcome respite to Detroit automakers, though they remain cautious.

General Motors spokesman Kevin Kelly told the Detroit Free Press on Nov. 19: ""We are carefully monitoring the situation on this, but our operations have not been impacted.""

Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra said: ""While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid, and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate.""

Crosstown at Stellantis, spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said of the latest development that Stellantis continues to monitor the situation. When asked whether the automaker had any production disruptions, Tinson said in an email: ""Stellantis continues to develop mitigation strategies to minimize potential disruption.""

But during its third-quarter earnings call with the media, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker had a ""cross-functional ‘war room’ "" where a team manages this situation daily.

Ford Motor Co. did not immediately provide a comment in reaction to the latest news. However, during its third-quarter earnings call with the media, COO Kumar Galhotra said Ford is working with both the U.S. and Chinese administrations for a resolution and that CEO Jim Farley had traveled to Washington, D.C., to push for a resolution.

""The kind of parts Nexperia makes are fairly common parts and we have maximized our buy for these components from other sources as much as we could,"" Galhotra said last month. ""We're tracking how much time we have, how much we've been able to buy, how long it could take to resolve this situation.""

He said it will be very close in terms of keeping supply of the chips until there is a solution.

""We believe a very quick breakthrough is necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses,"" Galhotra said. ""Not just for us, but for the entire industry.""

Auto supply chain has weak links

Last month, Honda Motor was the first automaker to indicate its production was impacted by the chips dispute. Honda made production cuts at all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Volkswagen indicated at that time that it only had about a week's supply left of semiconductor chips before its production could be affected.

That's why, while this pause is a small step toward a resolution, it is still welcomed news in the auto industry, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

""With the trade tensions currently disrupting the global supply chain, any easing is a good sign,"" Fiorani told the Detroit Free Press.

But he warned that this event should serve as a warning to every player in the automotive industry that they must address any weak link in their supply chain.

""Nexperia is just the latest in a long line of broken links that can quickly bring down on an automaker or even the whole industry,"" Fiorani said. ""Semiconductors have been in the spotlight for five years and the potential hazards are not going away anytime soon, but chips are just the most obvious component that can cause trouble.""

Fiorani said all automakers and suppliers should secure supplies of core materials such as aluminum, steel, cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium as well as chips going forward.

“Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.” Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development.
More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act.","The Environmental Protection Agency wants to take away federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands in Louisiana and the rest of the country, allowing them to be polluted or developed without the need for permits under a new set of proposed regulations the agency unveiled Monday.

The EPA’s long-awaited proposed rules would change what counts as federally protected waters in the United States. They suggest more rollbacks of regulations that could lead to development in Louisiana and across the country in areas that have long been shielded.

The draft regulations cover what are called the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS. They include new definitions for what counts as a wetland that falls under the protection of the Clean Water Act.

In short, the proposed updates require wetlands to touch permanent bodies of water — such as lakes, rivers or streams — and have visible surface water for at least part of the year in order for federal safeguards to apply.

Most at risk in Louisiana are the non-coastal, inland swamps that make up about 59% of the state’s wetlands area, according to an analysis from the Environmental Law Institute.

Environmental advocates argue the rules would put important ecosystems, flood control measures and pollution management at risk, while legal experts worry the definitions will only add more confusion to an already complex topic.

The public will have 45 days to submit a comment on the proposed WOTUS rules once they are officially published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The EPA will then consider whether any comment warrants revisions in the proposed regulations, which would be incorporated into the final version. The Trump administration has not laid out a timeline for putting the new rules into effect.

“I think it’s a big alarm for pretty much wherever you are, that federal oversight over wetlands is drastically limited, and there is not a backup plan to deal with this,” said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy.

“It’s going to create a lot of … problems for states and local communities going forward who have relied on federal oversight and the mitigation for wetlands and development,” she added. “There will be confusion.”

The removal of certain federal wetlands protections follows the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA, which pared back federal authority to enforce the Clean Water Act. An Idaho couple successfully challenged the agency when it stopped them from developing their property, with justices interpreting the definition of Waters of the United States to mean “’only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing.”

The proposed rule raises questions in Louisiana as to whether future construction could disqualify even more wetlands from Clean Water Act protection, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a Louisiana-based environmental advocacy group.

Central to whether or not a wetland is protected is whether or not it touches a lake, river or bayou on which a boat can navigate.

“In Louisiana, that can get a little squishy,” Rota said.

The Louisiana Legislature passed a law earlier this year that defines wetlands separated from surface water connections by manmade levees as “fastlands,” excluding them from state protections. With the newly proposed federal WOTUS definitions following the same deregulatory lines as Louisiana, certain wetlands here would no longer have any safeguards against development, advocates say.

Plus, Louisiana now allows future construction of levees and berms to disqualify wetlands from state protection. Even if an area has coverage under the law today, it could lose it if a levee is built around it in the future, Rota said.

State Sen.“Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, who authored the legislation, said this is an area in which revisions to the proposed WOTUS rule are necessary.

“In public comment, they can go through all of those and get some good answers for stuff like that,” said Fesi. “I don’t want to go fill up a swamp that’s full of cypress trees.”

Fesi added that he is “excited” about the proposed rules and believes current building codes are adequate to address concerns over building in flood-prone areas.

“I think there’s been a lot of rules put in place that protects against some of the problems” with flooding, he said. “Some of it just went too far, and so they’re cutting back.”

Some Louisiana wetlands will still have protections in place against development. For example, any area that touches the navigable waters of the Gulf of Mexico falls under the Clean Water Act, and the state’s coastal zone construction restrictions protect other areas.

More at risk are the state’s inland wetlands, which have no added barriers to development without the Clean Water Act. These areas would need to meet the federal definition of having surface water at least during the wet season as well as continually touch a waterway like a lake, river, stream or bayou.

“Hopefully this will not have a huge impact on coastal restoration activities and protecting our coastal wetlands,” Rota said. “But our coastal wetlands are only as healthy as our internal wetlands and internal waterways that are feeding them.”

“Whenever you remove some of these more upland wetlands or ephemeral streams that supply either fresh water, nutrients … it could still have an impact,” he added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9859-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:47.113689

Versant's Maine Public District in far northern Aroostook County will see bills go up $16 a month, almost $200 a year.

Every year, the commission undergoes a competitive bidding process to select electricity suppliers that provide Versant and CMP customers power through a regulated rate called the standard offer.

Electricity supply makes up half of Versant customers' bills and 40% of CMP bills. The remainder is transmission and distribution fees and ""public policy"" charges that cover some of Maine's renewable energy initiatives, according to the commission.

""We recognize that rising energy costs create real challenges for Maine households and businesses,” PUC chair Philip Bartlett said in a press release.

""The Standard Offer reflects current market realities and the Commission remains committed to securing the lowest reasonable prices for Maine electric utility customers in a challenging energy environment,"" Bartlett added.

Wholesale natural gas prices across the country are expected to be about 58% higher in 2025 than they were the year before, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Gas prices for electric generation specifically are up 37%, according to the agency.

Andrew Price, president and CEO of Competitive Energy Services, a consulting group in Portland, said several factors are driving demand.

Price said the U.S. is exporting more natural gas than ever before. At the same time gas demand is soaring to fuel generators that power Artificial Intelligence data centers and consumer electrification such as heat pumps and electric vehicles.

Despite years of adding renewable wind and solar generation onto the New England grid, it still relies on gas generators, Price said.

But pipeline supply to New England is constrained, so Price said when demand for residential gas spikes in the winter, there's not enough for power plants and that contributes to high prices.

""The system has to fall back on liquified natural gas that's imported, or oil, and so we do see higher prices here in New England than other places in the U.S. because of that pipeline constraint that really hits in those peak months,"" Price said.

In a statement, Maine Department of Energy Resources acting commissioner Dan Burgess said that a dependence on fuels directly tied to global markets continues to subject Maine families to volatile energy costs.

""Affordability remains a top priority for the Department as we work to advance initiatives to address this urgent challenge by expanding energy efficiency, ensuring ratepayer investments are carefully considered, and expanding responsible clean energy production to help stabilize costs,"" Burgess said.

The contracts approved by the PUC will push electric prices to the highest point since 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted international gas markets.

In a statement, CMP spokesperson Dustin Wlodkowski said rising supply rates were a direct consequence of state policymakers' decision to deregulate the electricity market 25 years ago which divorced power generation companies from transmission and distribution companies.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9bf461a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+643/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2Ff4%2F947c89d5492e8642a1a5e2e008dc%2Fimg-3301.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:40.974472

Hybrids are expected to outpace BEV adoption due to their lack of dependence on charging infrastructure and higher residuals than ICE vehicles.","LAS VEGAS — What a difference a year makes in the automotive space when politics are involved.

A year ago battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were expected to continue to grow in sales and market share, bolstered by federal and state regulations pushing EV adoption and federal incentives encouraging EV purchases.

Since President Donald Trump came into office earlier this year, he has eliminated those incentives and that has caused a recalculating of forecasts for the growth in BEVs and hybrid vehicles in the U.S.

BEV adoption has plateaued in the U.S. over the past two years, according to the new Joint Powertrain Trends and Outlook Forecast, produced by PwC Strategy& for the Auto Care Association (ACA) and MEMA Aftermarket Suppliers.

In a U.S. car parc of 284 million vehicles this year, BEVs account for 3% and hybrids 5%; by 2035, as the car parc grows to 291 million vehicles, EVs are expected to account for 11% and hybrids 15%, the report said.

That is a change from last year's report, where BEVs were expected to account for 20% of total vehicles in 2035 and hybrids about 13%.

As the U.S. short-circuits EVs, China has been charging ahead with electric vehicle adoption, the report said.

About 1.2 million EVs were sold in the U.S. in 2023 and 2024, compared with 6.7 million in China.

Meanwhile, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have gained some market share in the U.S. while losing share in China.

""One thing that's been interesting is that the hybrid electric vehicles, those continue to gain adoption. So the first half of 2025, it was 12% of the new registrations were hybrid electric, versus 9% in 2024, so a little bit more growth,"" noted Mike Chung, ACA's senior director of market intelligence.

The report stated there are four BEV adoption drivers: vehicle economics, including cost of ownership and regulations, incentives or ICE bans; model availability and choices; consumer behavior, including EV range anxiety and access to charging stations; and charging infrastructure and availability.

New BEV prices in the U.S., averaging $55,400, is 17% higher than the average vehicle transaction price of $47,400. Meanwhile, in China, BEV prices are nearly on par with ICE vehicles, at an average $25,800.

The report also noted the recent regulatory headwinds that will limit BEV adoption in the U.S., including elimination of federal tax credits, which will reduce affordability.

According to surveys, the primary motivations for considering an EV purchase is its lower operating costs, convenience and driving experience. While the main obstacles deterring potential EV buyers include charging duration, battery lifespan, driving range and the initial high cost of purchase.

About 52% of prospective EV buyers would consider a driving range of 185-250 miles acceptable provided they could charge their vehicle in under 30 minutes, the survey said.

The report said that given the favorable economics and lack of reliance on a charging infrastructure, PHEVs are expected to grow in sales in the U.S. until 2035.

By then, hybrids are forecast to account for 37% of new vehicles sales, while BEVs would account for 30%.

This is a more conservative take than last year's report, which predicted BEV sales would account for 59% of new vehicle sales in 2035 and hybrids 22% of sales.

The report said that major OEMs are investing in new hybrid models, with 40 HEV models in 2024 and a predicted 115 models by 2031.

""As a result, we expect to see a major increase in hybrid model availability over the next five to six years that will support higher HEV adoption in the U.S.,"" according to the report.

Hybrids are currently priced about 5% higher than comparable ICE vehicles, but with hybrids' fuel economy, the cost advantage of hybrids is realized after 40,000 miles (or about three to four years).

Despite the higher upfront price, the three-year cost of operation, for standard compact and mid-sized SUVs, is lower for hybrids than ICE vehicles due to the lower fuel costs and high residual values, the report said.

Hybrids are expected to outpace BEV adoption due to their lack of dependence on charging infrastructure and higher residuals than ICE vehicles.

The report expects BEVs to achieve first-cost parity with ICE vehicles by 2028.

Beyond 2030, BEVs are expected to take a share away from ICE vehicles as prices go beyond parity and a charging infrastructure is established, the report said.",https://www.tirebusiness.com/s3/files/styles/1200x630/s3/AdobeStock_573276156%20EV%20electric.jpeg,N,,2025-11-19 22:58:08.802377

The Environmental Protection Agency announced changes to the Clean Water Act that sportsmen’s organizations say could set us back 50 years to a time when rivers lit on fire and fish went belly up.

“This isn’t a little deal, this is a big deal,” says Chris Wood, CEO of Trout Unlimited. “It means that, in a worst-case scenario, the protections of the Clean Water Act, which meant that you couldn’t store chemicals in ephemeral streams, and you couldn’t have manure lagoons in intermittent streams, those protections could be gone.”

The housing, manufacturing, farming, and oil and gas industries, however, heralded the proposed changes as a welcome relief from what they say is over-regulation by the federal government.

“For too long, the regulatory structure under the [Waters of the U.S. Rule], which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S., undermining our ability to invest and build across the country,” says the National Association of Manufacturers in a statement.

The changes reflect a 2023 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Sackett vs Environmental Protection Agencythat said that the federal government could only police wetlands that have a “continuous surface connection to categorically included waters or have a significant nexus to interstate or traditional navigable waters,” describing “categorically included” waters as those that are “relatively permanent.”

This meant that the federal government could no longer require pollution discharge permits from the Army Corps of Engineers or the Environmental Protection Agency in most ephemeral streams or wetlands. What, exactly, “relatively permanent” meant, however, was up to the EPA itself.

Many sportsmen and conservation nonprofits derided the Supreme Court decision as “bad for the environment and for hunters and anglers.” And under the Biden Administration, more than two-thirds of wetlands and about 5 million miles of streams no longer required oversight of anyone wishing to dump or otherwise destroy and pollute streams and wetlands, says Jim Murphy, the National Wildlife Federation’s senior director of legal advocacy.

The current proposal, however, increases that to 80 percent of wetlands and untold miles of streams and removes federal oversight of streams that cross state lines, says the Izaak Walton League. That means one state’s water quality would depend on a neighboring state’s rules and regulations.

“It makes a bad situation worse,” Murphy says of the newest plan. “We’re really talking about a huge loss of basic pollution and destruction protections for the vast majority of the nation’s wetlands and streams. So there will be fewer places to fish or to hunt and the places that are left to fish and to hunt you will have to worry a little more about what you will be eating.”

The rule change would also threaten drinking water safety for one in three Americans, says the Izaak Walton League. It would also replace “clear and consistent definitions based on science,” with “vague terms like ‘wet season.’”

Wood of TU and others in the sporting and conservation community acknowledge that industries like agriculture require thoughtful and consistent regulations. There should not, however, be a complete overhaul of one of the country’s landmark environmental laws.

Temporary streams and wetlands store water from wet periods into dry ones, and they also provide about 50 percent of the water that ultimately ends up in major rivers, Murphy says.

Those seasonal streams are often headwaters and places where sensitive species like native trout go to spawn, says Wood.

“For close to 60 years, the Clean Water Act applied equally to small streams as it did to big streams and it worked really well,” Wood says. “When my dad was a graduate student at Georgetown, he would never go out to the Potomac River because he’d get sick. Now I take my kids down there and we catch shad hand-over-fist. That story can be told about tens of thousands of waterways across America.”

“Disposing of leftover food products wastes money and pollutes our environment. Estimated methane emissions from Massachusetts landfills have the same climate impacts as 116,000 cars on the road for a year. It doesn’t have to be that way. Food scraps (banana peels, etc) should be composted, and food waste (edible food that’s tossed) should be reduced through rescue, better labeling, and donation.

In 2025, Tech Breakthrough named the company its “Battery Technology Company of the Year.” “I think we’ve really revolutionized RVs with the onset of lithium batteries,” said Phares.
“This award is more than just an investment in Dragonfly Energy; it is an investment in Nevada’s future,” said Phares.","Denis Phares, PhD, was convinced that there had to be a better way. As an associate professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the University of Southern California, whose research included aerosol science, nanotechnology, fluid mechanics, and powder processing, he knew there just had to be a better way to manufacture the highly versatile lithium-ion battery cells that were helping to reimagine a variety of the world’s consumer electronics. Not only that, Phares was certain that better solutions were possible at lower production costs while improving the collateral impact on human health, climate, and the environment.

It was 2012, and Phares was ready to make his presence in the industry known beyond the classroom and research papers. So, he packed his bags, enrolled in the MBA program at the University of Nevada, and ventured off to North America’s lithium epicenter to launch his own enterprise.

The road to renewable energy

Today, Phares is president and chief executive officer of Dragonfly Energy Corp., a battery technology company based in Reno, NV. Dragonfly has become renowned for pioneering deep-cycle lithium batteries for its niche markets and is a leader in dry-electrode lithium manufacturing at pilot scale.

“At the time that I left academia, the cost of solar was coming down so fast, but the cost of batteries was still a bottleneck to displacing fossil fuels with renewable energy,” said Phares, who earned his doctorate in environmental engineering science from the California Institute of Technology and bachelor’s in physics from Villanova University. “The mission of the company was to reduce the cost of manufacturing storage so that the combination of storage and renewable energy had a lower levelized cost than burning fossil fuels.”

Dry electrode manufacturing

One who previously had experience in securing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants for other types of ventures — including work related to solar cell manufacturing — it became time to advance the now patented aerosol-based dry deposition manufacturing processes for manufacturing electrode material (both anode and cathode) for lithium-ion batteries.

“But there wasn't much interest in the investment community in batteries or manufacturing at all back then,” said Phares. “That story has changed, however.”

Initially going to market with what he branded as “Battle Born Batteries,” a line of lithium iron phosphate (LFP)-powered deep-cycle batteries with a namesake that pays homage to the “Battle Born State” of Nevada, Phares sold his first battery in 2014, and the product caught on as an alternative to lead-acid batteries, the most common type of batteries utilized in recreational vehicles (RVs).

“I was initially just importing commodity cells and designing and assembling the battery packs in Reno,” said Phares. “That business just exploded and became profitable pretty quickly.”

Why RV owners choose lithium over lead-acid batteries

Finding a place within a niche market that was already on the rise prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Phares and Dragonfly started to see an exceptional spike in business as the crisis lingered and more people sought the refuge of the outdoors. “RVs grew really big,” Phares explained. “More people began to buy RVs as a way to get out of the cities and to just get away.”

As more people retreated to parks and campsites, those locations became more crowded more frequently, creating difficulty in accessing freestanding pedestals that required plugging into to operate heavy high-power appliances such as air conditioners, coffee makers, and hair dryers. “And as more RVs were put on the road, the number of pedestals stayed the same,” said Phares. “But lithium batteries allowed you to power all those power-consuming appliances without needing a pedestal. And that was really game-changing. We're the market leader now.”

Among the RV industry brands that Dragonfly serves today are Airstream, Leisure Travel Vans, Tiffin, Forest River, REV Group (the first RV company to install Dragonfly batteries at the factory), and its most recently announced collaboration with Awaken RV. To date, the company has sold more than 400,000 LFP batteries, including applications for industrial operations and major heavy-duty trucking fleets. In 2025, Tech Breakthrough named the company its “Battery Technology Company of the Year.”

“I think we’ve really revolutionized RVs with the onset of lithium batteries,” said Phares. “And now we're expanding into heavy-duty trucks, industrial solar, and other adjacent markets where storage really benefits from having a lithium battery solution, while at the same time continuing to scale up the dry electrode process. And we’re continuing to develop new chemistries such as solid-state chemistries in the cell development realm.”

The company has also expanded its reach to various regional locations across northern Nevada, positioning teams strategically within emerging markets, and has an office in Indiana that supports the sales team serving the RV market.

Nevada's strategic position in America's lithium supply chain

As of early October, the company’s relationship with the local region was poised to become strengthened through award funding from the Nevada Tech Hub, a consortium of governmental, industry, educational, and nonprofit organizations designed to improve the state’s lithium battery supply chain by aligning to leverage natural resources and develop a full-spectrum lithium economy within the state. With 31 Tech Hubs nationally, the program invests in regional partnerships to grow critical industries, bolster national security, and create jobs. Focused on building a complete “Lithium Loop,” a closed-loop regional lithium economy that would include extraction, processing, battery manufacturing, and recycling, Dragonfly’s award is expected to total approximately $300,000 to be applied toward high-impact modernization and workforce development initiatives in the state.

“This award is more than just an investment in Dragonfly Energy; it is an investment in Nevada’s future,” said Phares. “By modernizing our operations and expanding our skilled workforce, we believe we can both drive efficiencies that benefit our shareholders, customers, and employees by creating long-term economic growth and high-value jobs across the state. This non-dilutive capital is highly beneficial to our growth strategy.”

Key elements of the project include advancing toward International Organization for Standardization certification, modernizing production systems, and upgrading the company’s battery manufacturing lines. Dragonfly also plans to recruit and upskill production floor personnel, expanding career opportunities in machining, automation, and maintenance. With nearly 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space in South Reno, the company believes it is positioned to scale operations while anchoring high-value clean energy jobs in Nevada. “Nevada is home to one of the largest lithium deposits in the world,” said Phares. “And since lithium is going to be such an important part of our energy future, the state of Nevada is going to be a big part of that. It just makes sense because of the natural resource that we have in the state.”

Patent portfolio: Protecting innovation in battery technology

Working in the fields of energy, nanotechnology, fluid mechanics, and powder processing over the last three decades has provided Phares with a unique perspective as well as an influence on the industry. “As a professor, I was keenly aware that the product of my work was the students themselves,” he said. “I loved teaching, and I loved making an impact by putting out highly skilled members of the economy. But I got the bug for wanting to make a more direct impact on technology. And I think as an entrepreneur, as a company founder, I have found a vehicle to do that. You can more rapidly raise money and more easily direct how that money is spent without being part of a larger institution. I just feel fortunate that I was able to be exposed to both. Not a lot of folks get to do that.”

In the time that he has launched Dragonfly, Phares has achieved nearly 100 patents, the most recent of which came in early September with the company’s Wakespeed Charge Control technology that addresses the transfer of power from a towing vehicle to a trailer for the purpose of charging onboard batteries. With the company’s latest innovation, the Dragonfly IntelLigence battery communication technology, which received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in mid-October, Dragonfly is poised to expand its growing portfolio. Through this capability, key operating data may be shared by multiple battery systems and related wireless devices over a connected mesh network. Warning codes may also be propagated if certain conditions are detected, even if one of the battery systems is powered down. “We have a vast patent portfolio that the company owns, and that's really important,” said Phares. “The intellectual property portfolio spans everything from fundamental cell chemistries, to cell production, to equipment used to produce cells, to battery packs and battery pack design, to ancillary devices associated with storage systems.”

His future goals include production of the company’s own cells and to be able to produce them domestically. “Ultimately, we want to deploy our technology in onshore production of lithium batteries,” he said. “We want to spread the message that there are better ways to make lithium-ion batteries. And, most importantly, if you want to onshore the production of lithium-ion batteries, because the vast majority are produced in China, you have to innovate with manufacturing processes, or you're never going to be able to compete with the prices you can get out of Chinese-made batteries, even with tariffs. This is on our roadmap, and we're intent on executing it.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltd29f86d4bb2427a6/691e2eb1eafe03ab78af786c/Dragonfly_Energy-1.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-19 19:59:27.080672

It was knocked out all day; there were power lines and trees down across the roads. The first day of school was scheduled to be the very next day. I was at work. Teachers were getting their classrooms ready to welcome kids.

This was August, the middle of hurricane season. There was a big hurricane passing a couple hundred miles south of Hawaii. There were hurricane-force winds down in town. We had volleyball practice; we had enough daylight to practise in the gym. During practice, at about 3.30pm, I received a call from a parent at the school. She said: “Ryan, there’s a fire in town. We’ve lost our house. We barely got out alive.” Theirs was one of the first houses to go.

Then I received another call from another family. “Ryan, our whole neighbourhood just went up in flames.” Lahaina is small, but those houses are in different parts of Lahaina. In between those homes were several hundred other homes. I just went: “What is going on down in town?”

We sent the kids home. Just after, around 5pm, all our cellphones went out. There’s still no power, no communication, no information. I came home, slightly aware of what was starting. Before the phones went out, a few families had called and asked if they could come to our house. As we went to bed, they showed up. They were like: “We got evacuated. It was just precautionary. We think we’ll be able to go back in the morning, and everything will be there.” So they didn’t have much stuff packed.

We were setting up mattresses, and people were getting ready to sleep on couches. We had candles going everywhere. There was chatter about what was happening in town. We had five different sets of families in our house that night.

I was in bed, and at about 10.30pm, one of our kids came in and said: “Hey, Dad, there’s a police officer at the door and he wants to talk to you.” I went to the door. He said: “Hey, are you Ryan, the principal of Maui prep?” I said yes. He goes: “We got to open your school right now. We have to set it up as an evacuation centre because there’s buses on their way up to the school. You need to open everything up.”

I hopped in the car and drove up to the school, roughly 1km away, out of the fire zone. The police officer had his lights going and I was following. Everything was just black. There’s still no power. But, at one point, you could see this big, orange, arching glow over the whole town. The stark contrast: this bright orange glow with pitch black sky. Feeling the weight of knowing something tragic was going on but not having any idea of the scale of the devastation.

There were several cars and a bus waiting. The police officer and I opened up the gates and as many classrooms as we could. All these city buses started arriving full of people covered in smoke and ash and soot. They were just black head to toe. People were injured. Some were in their clothes. Some were in their pyjamas. Some were soaking wet.

The fire started up in the mountains and was getting to the highway. People were abandoning their cars and the only place they could keep going was the ocean. I remember carrying a little 80-year-old Japanese lady off the bus and she was drenched because she had spent a few hours out there. People were trying to find her some dry clothes or a towel and trying to get her out of the wind.

The buses just kept coming. An influx of people and buses. Maui prep families started showing up to the school to help. Our school is only 300 kids. That night, we had 800 people on our campus.

Everything just felt muted. People were so in shock, just laying on the floors of our classrooms, sleeping on our gym floor. Families huddled up together having quiet conversations. Our only sources of light that night were emergency gas-powered floodlights on our outdoor basketball court.

The only time anything was loud was if someone was injured. We had a little triage centre set up in one of our classrooms. I don’t recall any major injuries but people had bumps and scrapes, some of them were burns, sprained ankles. People were crying or expressing a great deal of pain. In the night, someone would be moaning.

I remember the sun coming up the next morning. A mother drove up to the school, saw me standing out in the driveway and said: “Ryan, have you seen my girls? We don’t know if they got out of the fires or not.” I coached her girls in club volleyball. I said: “Sorry, I haven’t seen them. They aren’t up here.” I think she was hoping they had somehow made their way up to the school in the night.

I remember we couldn’t cook anything. There’s no power. We had a little concession area. We started handing out all of our bags of Cheetos or ice-cream. We had some bottled water. Tourists, visitors and residents started dropping off food, water and clothes. These weren’t county officials. These weren’t government officials. These were families from other parts of Maui that had gone to Walmart or Target in central Maui, bought as much stuff as they could with their own money, drove it out to us and unloaded truckloads of supplies at the school.

We gave as many as we could to the evacuees and we still had all these supplies. We said: “We’ll serve as a food, water, clothing distribution site.” We let four cars in at a time. A volunteer would come and say: “Hey, what are your needs?” “Oh, man, it would be great if we could just get some water.” Here’s a whole crate of water. Next car comes in. A line of several hundred cars parked down the hill, out to the highway.

I remember this one gentleman who had everything he had in his car. I asked him how he was doing and what he needed. He just said: “I lost everything. I lost my son in the fire. Do you have any water for me?” He was in a state of shock, non-emotive, factual. His son was one of the only kids who died in the fire. I remember my heart breaking for him and feeling helpless. There’s nothing you can do.

It was in the lineup where I saw that mother and her two girls. They drove up to the school and the two of them piled out of the back of their minivan. Their mom was beaming ear to ear. That was such a massive sense of relief and joy. We gave each other big hugs. I knew those girls were OK.

Because the power was out, we had restaurants bringing up food. One family took it upon themselves to feed all 200 of the volunteers. They brought propane grills, cooking breakfast burritos or sausages and bacon and eggs. They cooked up some expensive steaks. I remember those smells and going: “Boy, this is the best-tasting and smelling piece of bacon I’ve had in my life.”

Four or five days after the fire, power miraculously came back on. We thought it was going to be out for a month. There are five other schools on West Maui: two burned down, three were shut down. Five of the schools on West Maui had burned down or shut down so we were like: “Let’s figure out a way to start school.” We met as an administrative team and said: “How can we serve these kids? How can we get as many kids in as possible?” Our teachers said: “Ryan, we don’t care how many kids. You fit as many kids to our school as you can.” We had over 1,000 applications in four days. We brought in 150 students in that admission period. Unfortunately, we couldn’t bring all those kids just because we didn’t have enough space.

We had first day of school on 21 August. Normally, it’s a fun, celebratory time, our mascots out there waving signs and taking pictures with kids. But it wasn’t like that. It wasn’t sad. It wasn’t celebratory. It was trying to create a warm, welcoming environment for kids.

I remember telling teachers: “If you’re assigning chapter 1, page 13, questions 10 through 30 in the math textbook on day one, you’ve missed the mark.” We’re not here to add to their stress. We are here to give them some anchor in the storm. We’re here to support them emotionally. Some of these kids were living in hotel rooms. Some were living with three other families at a friend’s house. I remember “normalcy” being used quite a bit then, and I remember feeling sick of using this word.

Six months after the fire, we were sitting in school and the power goes out. Immediately, the question was: “Are we going to be safe? Is there going to be another fire?” It was so fresh among a lot of our younger students. That trauma is still present for a lot of people. A year and a half out, homes are now being built in Lahaina. The fire continues to be the foundation on which our daily lives are built.

There is a general sense of frustration that the federal government only provided $700 for people who lost their homes. It would’ve been great for there to be a higher level of support. Having more, better evacuation routes is part of the conversations Lahaina residents are having as they rebuild.

What we learned after is that initial wave of response is not some relief organization or government. It’s people helping. This seems to be typical of disasters. The devastation to the community is well documented. On one side of the coin, we saw devastation. On the flip of it, we saw the positive nature of humanity shining through in how people supported other people.

It’s a little bit funny, but for the next six months or so, we’d be walking around town and we’d see a little elderly lady walking around in a Maui prep uniform. We knew that there was a good chance she was up at the school that night and that was someone who we were able to help and support.

We got to bear witness to this side of humanity that was so giving and so supportive. Seeing the generosity of others willing to support our community in such a time of drastic need. Seeing the resilience of everyone who lived through that experience, however big or small. I think that instills a lot of hope for me and our community.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621d9558d4d76f4e0ebb64e9233f671076d9bb9c/0_3062_5504_4403/master/5504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e48ca4c7b2fe62644ecfa291af49e871",N,,2025-11-19 17:01:51.786007

EPA appears poised to provide relief from many of the reporting requirements included in the current (2023 edition) of the TSCA reporting rule.
This eliminates the massive challenge consumer product makers would face in tracing minimal PFAS content within complex finished consumer products imported between 2011 and 2022.
The proposed amendments will align the PFAS rule more closely with other standard TSCA reporting requirements to which consumer product manufacturers generally are not subject, such as the Chemical Data Reporting rule.
Next Steps for Manufacturers Regardless of these new exemptions from EPA, consumer product manufacturers should continue to focus on preparing for meeting PFAS-in-products reporting obligations in various states (and in some states, complete product prohibitions).","On November 13, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed significant amendments to the October 2023 final rule for PFAS reporting under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7). If codified, these modifications would substantially reduce the regulatory burden for covered entities, particularly for manufacturers and importers of consumer products, small entities, and companies that manufacture or import products and formulations that might contain only trace levels of PFAS.

The proposed changes will considerably ease the reporting burden for consumer product manufacturers, for whom the feasibility of comprehensive reporting on imported articles presents a significant challenge. Consumer product makers are already facing a host of other evolving state-based bans and restrictions on intentionally-added PFAS when present in expansive categories of covered products. EPA appears poised to provide relief from many of the reporting requirements included in the current (2023 edition) of the TSCA reporting rule. Notable proposed exemptions that will benefit consumer product manufacturers, but were absent in the original rule, include:

Exemption for Imported Articles: Crucially, EPA is proposing to completely exempt reporting on PFAS that is imported as part of an article. This eliminates the massive challenge consumer product makers would face in tracing minimal PFAS content within complex finished consumer products imported between 2011 and 2022.

De Minimis Concentration Exemption: A concentration threshold of 0.1% or lower for PFAS in mixtures or products also would be exempt from reporting.

Other Exemptions: The proposal also includes exemptions for PFAS that are impurities, certain byproducts, R&D chemicals manufactured in small quantities, and non-isolated intermediates.

The proposed amendments will align the PFAS rule more closely with other standard TSCA reporting requirements to which consumer product manufacturers generally are not subject, such as the Chemical Data Reporting rule.

In addition, the original reporting window, which had already been delayed, is now proposed to be shifted again. The new submission period will open 60 days after the effective date of the final rule, for a period of three months.

Read our November 2025 Advisory for a broader analysis of the proposed rule.

What Remains Unchanged?

The fundamental aspects of the original rule, besides the newly proposed exemptions, largely remain intact. The requirement to report on PFAS manufactured or imported at any time between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2022, remains in place. In addition, covered companies must continue to exercise due diligence to locate and report existing test data and studies concerning PFAS that is known or reasonably ascertainable within their organization and through reasonable inquiry to suppliers or customers.

Next Steps for Manufacturers

Regardless of these new exemptions from EPA, consumer product manufacturers should continue to focus on preparing for meeting PFAS-in-products reporting obligations in various states (and in some states, complete product prohibitions).

Products that may already be covered by state PFAS-in-product laws, despite these proposed federal revisions, can include:

Non-Stick Cookware Cleaning Products Water-Resistant Textiles and Outdoor Apparel After-Market Sprays and Treatments for Water or Stain Resistance

Grease-Resistant Food Contact Materials

Specialized Industrial or Commercial Products

Paints, Varnishes, and Surface Sealants Personal Care Products and Cosmetics

The proposed changes that EPA may make to its PFAS reporting rule are not yet finalized and are subject to a public comment period that remains open until December 29, 2025. This comment period presents an opportunity for advocacy with EPA and for states to further harmonize their PFAS-related obligations. Consumer product manufacturers should review their potential reporting obligations based on these proposed exemptions and consider submitting comments to EPA, with the support and guidance of counsel, through the official rulemaking docket at Regulations.gov (Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2020-0549).

AEP also owns AEP Energy, which provides innovative competitive energy solutions nationwide.","FORT WAYNE, Ind., Nov. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Indiana Michigan Power (I&M), an American Electric Power company, is taking another step to deliver reliable and affordable energy to meet the needs of its customers today and in the future. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved the agreement between I&M, Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC), and consumer groups to acquire the Oregon Clean Energy Center, an existing 870 megawatt (MW) natural gas plant located in Oregon, Ohio.

The acquisition of the Oregon Clean Energy Center and its 870 MW of natural gas-fueled electric generation is one component of I&M's Future Ready plan, which outlines a comprehensive strategy to serve customers in a cost-effective, reliable manner as the demand for energy increases.

With today's IURC order, and the approval received by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in October, I&M now has secured the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the acquisition of the Oregon facility. Over the next few months, I&M will work with the current owners of the Oregon facility to transfer ownership and operations of the facility in a safe and efficient manner. I&M expects to take ownership of the Oregon facility in March 2026.

""The Oregon Clean Energy Center is an important opportunity to further diversify I&M's current generation portfolio, acquire dependable generation, and position us for future growth to the benefit of all our customers,"" said Steve Baker, I&M president and chief operating officer.

I&M is currently navigating an unprecedented time in its history. As the company looks ahead, power demand is expected to more than double the Indiana peak from approximately 2,800 MW in 2024 to more than 7,000 MW in the 2030 timeframe. The rapid growth in energy demand provides an opportunity for I&M to reshape the way it serves current customers and those the company will serve decades into the future.

“Funded by the Energy Dominance Financing Program, this interest-bearing loan will lower Constellation's cost of financing and leverage private investment to restore reliable nuclear energy to the grid and help America win the AI race,” said Constellation Energy, the biggest owner of U.S. nuclear power plants.

Last year, Constellation signed its largest-ever power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which paved the way for the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant.

The 20-year agreement paves the way for the launch of the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC) with the restart of Three Mile Island Unit 1, Constellation said in September 2024.

Three Mile Island Unit 1 operated for decades before being shut down for economic reasons six years ago.

Under the deal, Microsoft will purchase energy from the restarted unit as part of its goal to help match the power its data centers in PJM use with carbon-free energy. The clean energy center is expected to be online in 2028.

In today’s statement on the DOE loan for the Crane Clean Energy Center, Constellation president and CEO Joe Dominguez said that “It's a great example of how America first energy policies create jobs, growth and opportunities and make the grid more reliable.”

“Utilities and grid operators are moving too slowly and need to make regulatory changes that will allow our nation to unlock its abundant energy potential. Constellation and nuclear energy are helping to lead the way and we are thankful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for putting the 'energy' back into DOE,” Dominguez added.

Nuclear energy will be one of the winners of the AI and data center boom, as Microsoft and other hyperscalers have been looking to purchase zero-carbon electricity to power up their data centers, which are consuming growing amounts of electricity.

The proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days.
The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction.
In addition to congressional advocacy and technical comments to the EPA, NCBA also stood up for cattle producers’ rights in court.","On Nov. 17, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army announced the signing of a proposed rule to revise the definition of ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act. WOTUS defines whether or not a waterbody or wetland is under Federal jurisdiction and protected under the Clean Water Act.

This proposal implements the Supreme Court's decision in Sackett v. EPA.

In developing the proposed rule, EPA and the Army reviewed and considered the extensive feedback and recommendations the agencies received from states, tribes, local governments and stakeholders throughout consultations and the pre-proposal recommendations docket and listening sessions.

The agencies are proposing revisions to the amended 2023 definition of WOTUS to fully implement the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA.

Specifically, the agencies are proposing to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” under paragraph (a) by:

Deleting the interstate waters category

Deleting “intrastate” from the paragraph (a)(5) category for lakes and ponds.

In addition, the agencies are proposing to revise or add the following exclusions:

Revise the (b)(1) waste treatment system exclusion,

Revise the (b)(2) prior converted cropland exclusion,

Revise the (b)(3) ditch exclusion; and

Add the (b)(9) groundwater exclusion.

The agencies are also proposing to add definitions in paragraph (c) of their regulations for:

“continuous surface connection,”

“ditch,”

“prior converted cropland,”

“relatively permanent,”

“tributary,”

and “waste treatment system.”

These proposed revisions would limit those waters found to be jurisdictional compared to the Amended 2023 Rule, respecting state and tribal authority over their own land and water resources.

The agencies are not proposing to change the definition of “wetlands.” They are, however, proposing to add a definition of “continuous surface connection” which is used to identify which wetlands are “adjacent” and therefore jurisdictional under the Clean Water Act.

The proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days.

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association is announcing its support for the new proposed WOTUS rule, which comes after decades of advocacy by NCBA and its state affiliate partners to remove confusing and burdensome regulations on cattle farmers and ranchers.

""Waters of the US has been a longstanding and frustrating issue for family farmers and ranchers. Every few years, the definition of a ‘water of the US’ has changed. Often, this meant that small water features like prairie potholes or dry ditches suddenly fell under federal regulation,” said NCBA President and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein. “NCBA has spent years fighting to protect cattle producers from excessive red tape.

""We went to the EPA, advocated on Capitol Hill, and even took this issue all the way up to the Supreme Court to protect our members from federal overreach. We appreciate the EPA finally fixing previous WOTUS rules and supporting America’s family farmers and ranchers.""

The revised WOTUS rule ensures that only large bodies of water and their main tributaries fall under federal jurisdiction. Past WOTUS rules issued under the Obama and Biden administrations placed small, isolated water features under federal regulation. Prairie potholes, playa lakes, and even ditches that only carried water after large storms became regulated as if they were a large lake, river or ocean.

In addition to congressional advocacy and technical comments to the EPA, NCBA also stood up for cattle producers’ rights in court. The association filed an amicus brief in the US Supreme Court case Sackett v. EPA and received a major victory in 2023 that rolled back previous overreaching WOTUS rules.

NCBA also initiated numerous lawsuits under the Obama and Biden administrations to prevent what it finds to be harmful rules from impacting cattle producers.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) approved the agreement between I&M, Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC), and consumer groups to acquire the Oregon Clean Energy Center, an existing 870 megawatt (MW) natural gas plant located in Oregon, Ohio.

The acquisition of the Oregon Clean Energy Center and its 870 MW of natural gas-fueled electric generation is one component of I&M's Future Ready plan, which outlines a comprehensive strategy to serve customers in a cost-effective, reliable manner as the demand for energy increases.

With today's IURC order, and the approval received by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in October, I&M now has secured the necessary regulatory approvals to complete the acquisition of the Oregon facility. Over the next few months, I&M will work with the current owners of the Oregon facility to transfer ownership and operations of the facility in a safe and efficient manner. I&M expects to take ownership of the Oregon facility in March 2026.

""The Oregon Clean Energy Center is an important opportunity to further diversify I&M's current generation portfolio, acquire dependable generation, and position us for future growth to the benefit of all our customers,"" said Steve Baker, I&M president and chief operating officer.

I&M is currently navigating an unprecedented time in its history. As the company looks ahead, power demand is expected to more than double the Indiana peak from approximately 2,800 MW in 2024 to more than 7,000 MW in the 2030 timeframe. The rapid growth in energy demand provides an opportunity for I&M to reshape the way it serves current customers and those the company will serve decades into the future.

The Oregon facility will provide a stable source of power to meet the continuous operational requirements of our existing customers and new customers coming on to the I&M system. I&M's current generation portfolio incorporates a diverse mix of resources, including solar, wind, nuclear, coal and hydroelectric units. The company's vision for the future is to implement a comprehensive approach to providing a reliable, resilient, and stable electric power system that customers can access affordably.

""Demand is growing and we're planning for it, not waiting for it,"" Baker said. ""We're forecasting this growth and investing now in the generation and infrastructure needed to meet it. Our long-term planning strategy means we stay ahead of demand rather than reacting to it. This approach leads to more price stability and reliability for all of I&M's customers.""

Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) is headquartered in Fort Wayne, and its approximately 2,000 employees serve more than 600,000 customers. More than 85% of its energy delivered in 2024 was emission-free. I&M has at its availability various sources of generation including 2,278 MW of nuclear generation in Michigan, 450 MW of purchased wind generation from Indiana, more than 22 MW of hydro generation in both states and approximately 35 MW of large-scale solar generation in both states.

What do you think about Trump’s characterization of the loan interest deduction as helping middle-income buyers?","President Donald Trump highlighted a vehicle loan interest tax deduction during a November 19, 2025 speech, specifically mentioning Tesla and claiming the policy helps “middle income people” afford cars—four months after the same legislation eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit that made electric vehicles genuinely affordable for average buyers.

“Middle income people, they don’t know about it. They don’t really have deductions. We’re giving them a deduction on the interest, if they buy one of a nice Tesla car, they borrow the money, you’re so lucky, I’m with you, Elon,” Trump said during remarks, according to a transcript. “I’ll tell you, you are… Has he ever thanked me properly?”

The president clarified the benefit isn’t exclusive to Tesla or electric vehicles. “Although I do let him buy other than electric cars, but these are minor details,” Trump continued. “We’ll let it be for everybody.”

The Policy Behind Trump’s Remarks

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law on July 4, 2025, allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest paid on vehicle loans for American-assembled cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, and motorcycles purchased between 2025 and 2028, according to Kiplinger.

The deduction applies regardless of powertrain—gasoline, hybrid, or electric—as long as the vehicle’s final assembly occurred in the United States. Unlike most tax deductions, it’s available even to taxpayers who take the standard deduction rather than itemizing, making it an “above-the-line” benefit.

However, the $10,000 maximum comes with significant income restrictions. For single filers earning more than $100,000 or joint filers above $200,000, the deduction decreases by $200 for every $1,000 over those thresholds, CBS News reports. The benefit phases out completely at $150,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples.

What the Deduction Actually Saves Middle-Income Buyers

Despite Trump’s characterization of the policy as helping “middle income people,” automotive analysts say most buyers won’t come close to the $10,000 maximum deduction.

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, told CNBC that only exotic luxury vehicles generate $10,000 in annual interest charges. It would require financing approximately $112,000 to reach the full deduction in year one—the price range of vehicles like a Porsche Panamera or Cadillac Escalade, with monthly payments exceeding $2,000.

For the average American car buyer financing $44,000 over six years, the first-year interest deduction totals roughly $3,000, declining in subsequent years as principal payments increase, according to the American Financial Services Association.

Because deductions reduce taxable income rather than providing direct savings, a buyer in the 22% tax bracket claiming a $3,000 deduction saves approximately $660 on their actual tax bill. Smoke calculated the real-world benefit as “$500 or less in year one,” with declining value afterward.

By contrast, the eliminated EV tax credit provided up to $7,500 as an immediate discount at purchase, either applied directly to the vehicle price or claimed as a refundable credit on tax returns.

The September 30 EV Credit Expiration

The same Big Beautiful Bill that created the loan interest deduction terminated the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs on September 30, 2025—accelerating an end date that had originally been set for 2032 under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Bloomberg reported that the $3.4 trillion legislation primarily benefits the wealthiest Americans while eliminating clean energy subsidies and slashing Medicaid. The vehicle loan interest provision was presented as aid to the $1.6 trillion U.S. auto industry.

EV sales surged in the months leading up to the September 30 deadline as consumers rushed to claim the expiring credit. CNBC reported that July 2025 saw nearly 130,100 new EV sales, the second-highest monthly total on record, with dealers offering approximately $9,800 in additional incentives—worth about 17.5% of average transaction prices.

Post-Subsidy Market Collapse

The elimination of EV subsidies triggered exactly the market collapse that industry analysts had predicted. October 2025 EV sales dropped 24% compared to September, with unadjusted sales falling from 98,289 units to just 74,897 units in a single month, according to market analysis firm Omdia.

Cox Automotive senior analyst Stephanie Valdez Streaty warned that EV sales were likely to “collapse” in the fourth quarter once the tax credit expired and the market adjusted to the new financial reality.

General Motors announced in late October it would lay off more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities, with CFO Paul Jacobson stating the company expects “EV demand growth to slow pretty significantly.” Ford halted F-150 Lightning production indefinitely, while the company’s Model E electric vehicle division lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025.

Trump’s Complicated Tesla History

Trump’s November 19 comments praising Tesla mark a striking shift from the bitter public feud between the president and Tesla CEO Elon Musk that erupted in summer 2025 over the Big Beautiful Bill itself.

In July 2025, Trump threatened to terminate federal subsidies and contracts for Musk’s companies, posting on Truth Social:

“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.”

Musk fired back, declaring “I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now,” and calling the Big Beautiful Bill a “disgusting abomination.” The clash sent Tesla shares down more than 6% in premarket trading.

By June 2025, Trump had sold his own red Tesla Model S after purchasing it in March for $80,000 and showcasing it during a White House demonstration. The Daily Beast reported Trump’s decision to part with the vehicle followed the escalating tensions with Musk.

Trump’s November remarks also included a reference to eliminating EV mandates, stating: “We had a mandate. Which even Elon thought was ridiculous, that everybody has to have an electric car by 2030. And once, fortunately, he said, That’s a ridiculous thing.”

No federal law has ever mandated that Americans purchase electric vehicles, though the Biden administration did implement EPA emissions standards that Republicans argued effectively served as EV mandates by making it costly for automakers not to produce more electric models.

EVXL’s Take

This announcement feels like a victory lap for a policy that’s been law since July 4, delivered four months after it helped crater the EV market Trump claims to support. Let’s be clear about what actually happened here: Trump eliminated a $7,500 point-of-sale credit that made EVs accessible to middle-class families, replaced it with a tax deduction worth maybe $660 in actual first-year savings for average buyers, and is now calling that replacement a gift to “middle income people” while specifically name-checking the company whose CEO spent $250 million getting him elected.

We warned this would happen. Back in July when the Big Beautiful Bill passed, EVXL explained that industry analysts predicted a 72% drop in planned EV sales over the next decade. By November, those predictions were reality—October EV sales collapsed 24% as the post-subsidy chickens came home to roost. General Motors laid off 3,400 workers, Ford stopped making the F-150 Lightning, and America’s $28 billion Battery Belt devolved into ghost towns of idled plants and mass layoffs.

Meanwhile, Toyota just announced a $912 million investment in U.S. hybrid production while Detroit’s Big Three hemorrhage money on subsidy-dependent EV strategies that evaporated on September 30. That’s the real story—the automaker that never went all-in on EVs is expanding capacity for vehicles people actually buy without needing taxpayer subsidies, while competitors who bet everything on government incentives are now in strategic retreat.

The loan interest deduction isn’t worthless, but let’s not pretend it’s comparable to what it replaced. A middle-class family financing a $44,000 vehicle saves about $660 on next year’s taxes versus the $7,500 they could have knocked off the purchase price before September 30. The only people getting anywhere near that $10,000 maximum are wealthy buyers financing six-figure luxury vehicles—exactly the demographic that least needs tax relief for car purchases.

And then there’s the Tesla angle. Four months ago, Trump and Musk were in a public brawl over this exact legislation, with Trump threatening to cancel Tesla’s federal contracts and Musk calling the bill a “disgusting abomination.” Trump literally sold his Tesla Model S in June after their feud escalated. Now he’s back to praising the company, asking if Elon has thanked him properly, and positioning the loan deduction as some kind of favor to Tesla—even while clarifying it applies to all automakers, not just EVs.

The timing matters. Why tout this policy in November when it’s been law since July and took effect January 1? Because the post-subsidy EV market collapse is now undeniable, layoffs are mounting, and someone needs to pretend there’s still government support for American EV manufacturing. The loan deduction provides that political cover while delivering a fraction of the actual financial support the eliminated tax credit provided.

The average EV transaction price grew to $65,021 in October, up over $3,000 from January and almost $5,000 from September, according to a report from Edmunds.
This is the highest average EV price that Edmunds has recorded for a single month this year.
The tax credit was often criticized for being a subsidy for affluent consumers: the U.S. taxpayer effectively paid for wealthy buyers who could take advantage of the credit to buy fairly expensive EVs.
If there are fewer new EVs for sale long-term, that could push prices higher – or cause prices to stabilize at an elevated level.","Affordability isn't exactly a defining feature of the current U.S. car market. The average transaction price for all new vehicles is hovering around $50,000, but if you're looking for an EV, brace for even more serious sticker shock, in the post-government-incentive era.

Here's Automotive News:

October gave the auto retail industry its first look at what the electric vehicle market looks like without the federal tax credits. One of the biggest trends: EVs were more expensive. The average EV transaction price grew to $65,021 in October, up over $3,000 from January and almost $5,000 from September, according to a report from Edmunds.

This is the highest average EV price that Edmunds has recorded for a single month this year. The cheapest was $57,690 in July – and that's not really what anyone would call ""cheap,"" properly speaking, for a new car. At these price levels, it has been hard to buy an EV, and with the disappearance of federal tax credits, it has officially gotten quite a bit harder.

The tax credit was often criticized for being a subsidy for affluent consumers: the U.S. taxpayer effectively paid for wealthy buyers who could take advantage of the credit to buy fairly expensive EVs. The counterargument was that those rich early adopters would help establish an EV market in the U.S., generate revenue for manufacturers, and ultimately enable cheaper EVs to enter the picture as we transitioned away from the combustion engine.

However, the incentive also functioned as just that: an encouragement to consider an EV in the first place, especially in the leasing market, where the savings could be passed on to customers whose tax profile wasn't going to allow them to claim the credit. With rapid advancement in technology, leasing was also appealing to people who didn't want to be stuck owning an outdated EV. But as Automotive News reported, leasing penetration was also down big time in October. So we're kind of back to beginning now with EVs: the spike in prices means that affluent buyers could once again determine what the market looks like.

From the July low, prices have jumped about as much as the maximum $7,500 credit. So you might wonder if this is a top, or if they could climb even higher. It will be interesting to see what happens over the next six months. Automakers have been backing off from their EV plans and have been scrambling to revive combustion and hybrid programs. If there are fewer new EVs for sale long-term, that could push prices higher – or cause prices to stabilize at an elevated level. On the other hand, overall demand for EVs could decline, both a result of high prices and buyers deciding they aren't interested anymore. That could drive prices down. In a very basic sense, incentives distorted the market, and we'll now find out what it truly looks like when available products have to be matched up with customers motivated by factors other than their tax liabilities. If I were going to make a prediction, I'd say that by this time next year, that $65,000 average EV price is going to be closer to the norm, and that buyers hunting for affordable transportation in the U.S. will be shopping mainly for gas-powered vehicles.

On Nov. 17, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a proposed rule that would establish what the agencies call “a clear, durable, common-sense definition of ‘waters of the United States’ (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.”

The proposal, unveiled at EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C., follows the 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA.

According to the EPA, the agencies developed this proposed rule using input from multiple sources, including a pre-proposal recommendations docket, information from nine public listening sessions, and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Key proposed revisions include:

• Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

• Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

• Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

• Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

• Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems; Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

• Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as ""wet season,"" to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

“When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.”

“We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall. “The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines. We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity.”

The definition of WOTUS influences Clean Water Act implementation, including whether farmers, landowners and American businesses must secure permits before they can pursue projects that might impact surface water quality. Having a durable, consistent, and clear definition of WOTUS is essential to lowering costs for Americans and accelerating economic growth while protecting human health and the environment.

The proposed rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 20 and open for public comment for 45 days. The unpublished version can be viewed here.

California CCAs Achieve Procurement Milestone – Secure 21+ Gigawatts of New-Build Clean Energy Resources

Community choice energy providers are accelerating the state’s clean energy buildout, supporting California’s reliability goals and driving billions in long-term customer savings.

Sacramento, Calif.— The California Community Choice Association (CalCCA) announced today that California’s Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) have surpassed a major clean energy milestone, securing more than 21,000 megawatts (MW) of new-build clean energy capacity through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).

“Exceeding 21 gigawatts marks a pivotal moment not just for CCAs, but for California’s clean energy future,” said CalCCA Chief Executive Officer Beth Vaughan. “We are building a more reliable, affordable grid by prioritizing diverse clean energy resources and cutting-edge storage that strengthens local resilience for millions of Californians.”

CCA PPAs equate to:

21,380 MW of new solar, wind, geothermal, energy storage, and demand response resources

138 operational clean energy projects totaling more than 9,700 MW serving CCA customers (1,800+ MW became operational in the last year)

More than $48.4 billion in investments by CCAs to build and operate clean energy resources

Support for more than 48,000 construction jobs

Each November, CalCCA reports on CCA contracting progress, demonstrating how these community-driven providers are leading California’s clean energy buildout. CCAs now serve more than 15 million customers—more than one-third of the state’s population—across 200+ cities and counties.

Community choice energy providers have now secured 389 long-term PPAs, totaling 21,380 MW of new-build clean energy, including over 11,500 MW of renewable energy and more than 9,600 MW of energy storage. CCAs added over 3,000 MW of new contracts in just the last year.

This year, energy storage was the fastest-growing category in the CCA PPA portfolio, increasing by more than 20% since last year to support system reliability during peak demand and advancing California’s transition toward a resilient, 24/7 carbon-free grid.

CCA PPAs reflect a range of energy storage technologies including lithium-ion, vanadium redox flow batteries, and compressed air. Almost half of the new CCA-contracted clean energy projects that became operational in the past year were “hybridized,” meaning the clean energy is co-located with storage.

Notably, the suite of CCA PPAs includes CleanPowerSF’s first-of-its-kind contract with the Gonzaga Ridge Wind Farm in Merced County, which pairs 147.5 MW of in-state wind power with 50 MW of battery energy storage. Gonzaga Ridge is the first wind-storage hybrid PPA in the portfolio of CCA long-term new-build contracts.

CCAs’ long-term PPAs range from 10 to 27 years in length and average 16 years across all agreements. Long-term PPAs can reduce power purchasing costs by protecting customers from exposure to market price fluctuations.

CCAs are also continuing to leverage innovative green bond prepayment financing through the California Community Choice Financing Authority (CCCFA) to reduce costs. To date, CCCFA has issued $23 billion in prepayment bonds, equating to approximately $150 million per year in savings for community choice customers—nearly $4.6 billion over the lifetime of the contracts. More on CCA green bonds here.

Ambitious procurement strategies not only expand clean energy capacity for CCAs but also help meet and, in many cases, exceed state goals (mid-term reliability, renewables portfolio standard/SB 350) and local mandates set by CCA boards for renewable energy and reliability. The graphic below shows the capacity and types of energy resources procured by CCAs and their online years.

Community choice energy providers “now play a dominant role in renewable procurement, and their portfolios already exceed the 2030 RPS targets,” notes energy consulting firm Energy + Environmental Economics (E3). CCAs also account for the majority of procurement activity in California, according to E3.

CCA-contracted power projects are located across 28 California counties—from Humboldt to San Diego—and in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah.

The federal Department of Energy closed a $1 billion loan to finance the restart of a nuclear reactor at the former Three Mile Island plant, where energy will be produced to power Microsoft data centers in PJM’s transmission region.
Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project.
While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.
“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.","This story was updated on Nov. 19, 2025 at 3:53 p.m. to clarify a description of the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island.

The federal Department of Energy closed a $1 billion loan to finance the restart of a nuclear reactor at the former Three Mile Island plant, where energy will be produced to power Microsoft data centers in PJM’s transmission region.

Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project. He added that the reactor will be a strong source of clean energy, which will offset the added demand on the power grid created by data centers.

“We’re appreciative of [the loan],” Rodgers said. “It’ll be helpful to Constellation. And for the government, we’re going to pay it back in full with interest, so ultimately the taxpayer will get a return.”

Three Mile Island was the site of the worst nuclear power disaster in U.S. history, when one of its two reactors partially melted down in 1979, releasing some radioactive material into the surrounding environment. While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.

The other on-site reactor, which shuttered in 2019, is what will be brought back online by Constellation Energy. It’s being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center.

“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

The taxpayer-backed loan is financed through the Trump administration’s Energy Dominance Financing Program, which will back projects aimed at boosting energy infrastructure capacity for the U.S. Artificial Intelligence industry.

The project, however, has faced some pushback from community members who live near the reactor, some of whom lived through the 1979 incident.

At a public hearing on the reopening in July, a number of people voiced concerns about the risks of another meltdown being shouldered by Middletown and the surrounding communities in Dauphin County, while virtually all of the energy created will go towards powering data centers.

Others spoke in support of the project, with many welcoming the construction jobs it will bring and the potential positive impacts on the local economy.

The reactor is expected to be operational in 2027.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_4445-1024x7681763585650.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=DsSlh7pI,N,,2025-11-19 21:00:48.067301

The announcements, made during the Saudi-US Investment Forum, come as US President Donald Trump and Prince Mohammed spoke of deepening ties related to investment, security and technology.

“The partnership between our two nations is among the most consequential in the entire world, and together, the Crown Prince and I are making an alliance stronger and more powerful than it's ever been before,” Mr Trump said in remarks at the Kennedy Centre.

The business forum was attended by crowds of business executives including the heads of Aramco, Nvidia, Qualcomm, General Dynamics and Pfizer. Mr Trump said $270 billion in deals between dozens of companies would be signed at the forum.

Prince Mohammed announced on Tuesday that the kingdom would invest $1 trillion in the US, up from its previous $600 billion commitment. He did not provide details or a timeline. He also said he expects Saudi Arabia to spend $50 billion on chips in the “near term”.

The US and Saudi Arabia also signed a strategic AI partnership that will include the supply of advanced semiconductors. US companies need government approval to export chips to Saudi Arabia.

Regional experts have questioned how Saudi Arabia will be able to afford the $1 trillion commitment as it focuses on domestic investments. The kingdom is also running a current account and fiscal deficit, and is also facing softening oil prices amid the unwinding of production cuts by Opec+.

Humain deals

Among the announcements made on Wednesday was the formation of a joint venture involving the Public Investment Fund-backed Humain, which is expected to play a critical role in the kingdom's efforts to become an AI exporter.

Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in AI as part of its broader diversification efforts under its Vision 2030 project.

Humain, AMD and Cisco said the joint venture, which has yet to be named, would deliver up to 1 gigawatt of AI infrastructure by 2030.

The companies said it will combine Humain's data centres with technology from AMD and Cisco, which will be exclusive technology partners. AMD and Humain announced plans in May to invest up to $10 billion for 500MW of AI computing capacity over the next five years.

Adobe and Qualcomm also said they are linking up with the Saudi AI company to create content in Arabic using Humain's large language model Allam, Reuters reported.

Humain announced a strategic partnership with the New York-based Global AI to build a large-scale AI data centre in the US. It said the data centre will be designed for high-density compute and include Nvidia AI infrastructure.

“I believe Saudi Arabia is firmly on track to become the third pillar of global AI infrastructure,” Humain chief executive Tareq Amin said in a statement.

Humain has also led a $900 million financing round for video generation start-up Luma AI. The financing also includes participation from AMD's venture arm, as well as existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Amplify Partners and Matrix Partners.

Luma is also linking up with Humain to build a 2GW computer supercluster known as “Project Halo”, which the companies said will begin operations in the first quarter of next year.

AWS and Humain also announced the installation of up to 150,000 AI accelerators to develop an ""AI Zone"" in Riyadh that will support training and access to Nvidia infrastructure.

Musk's xAI in Saudi Arabia

Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said his AI start-up xAI, which features the Grok chatbot, also plans to develop a 500MW data centre in Saudi Arabia with Humain, which will rely on chips from Nvidia.

Mr Musk made the announcement alongside Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang during a panel session earlier on Wednesday.

The project represents xAI's first large-scale computing centre outside the US.

“This collaboration represents the first of its kind partnership to deploy xAI’s Grok across an entire country,” Mr Musk said in a statement.

Aramco signs series of deals

Saudi energy giant Aramco also announced 17 agreements with a potential value of more than $30 billion with US companies. Aramco said the agreements build on the previous 34 announced in May, bringing the total value to about $120 billion.

The preliminary deals range from liquefied natural gas to advanced materials manufacturing and financial services.

Among the LNG deals is a possible investment with MidOcean Energy in the Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast. It also announced an agreement with Commonwealth LNG on a separate Louisiana-based LNG project relating to Aramco Trading's potential purchase of LNG and gas.

The preliminary agreements come as Aramco aims for 20 million tonnes a year of LNG capacity.

Aramco signed a deal this year with NextDecade on a final agreement to buy 1.2 million tonnes a year of LNG from the Rio Grande LNG Facility's Train 4.

“For more than 90 years, we built a lot of strategic and historic relations with US partners. And it is continuing to grow in the US today,” Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said during a panel discussion.

The companies said the milestones advance their long-term partnership to develop solar projects that will expand and diversify Colombia’s renewable energy capacity with support from the European Union.

Petalo del Norte I, located between Cesar and Norte de Santander, is CFM’s first project to reach commercial operation in Latin America, the companies said.

The 26.4MWdc (19.9MWac) fixed-tilt solar plant generates more than 45GWh of electricity a year and avoids around 13,276 tonnes of CO₂ annually while serving approximately 32,600 people, they added.

According to the partners, the project was developed with Erco Energia, implemented by Andina Solar, and interconnected through a 1.2km aerial line at 34.5kV.

The companies said the project created 270 jobs, 64% of which were filled locally, with women representing 30% of the workforce.

CFM said it invested close to USD20m in development and construction funding through Climate Investor One, which is supported by the European Union, and that the project benefits from a 15-year power purchase agreement.

The companies said the USD125,000 Community Development Programme for Petalo del Norte I supports four neighbouring communities through initiatives in education, water access, women’s empowerment and rural enterprise development.

CFM said it has invested USD1.5m from Climate Investor One to develop Pradera, which will be Colombia’s largest solar-plus-storage plant.

The company added that Pradera will provide 40MWac of solar capacity and 18MWh of storage, generating more than 95.8GWh of power annually, avoiding about 129,000 tonnes of CO₂ and supplying around 71,000 people.

According to CFM, Pradera will create around 380 construction jobs and 29 permanent roles and will include a dedicated Community Development Programme.

The partners said the battery system will help smooth short-term fluctuations, manage grid imbalances and limit exposure to high-cost spot prices during dry periods such as El Nino events.

They added that both projects were enabled by CFM’s blended finance model, which combines public and private capital to balance risk and accelerate delivery.

Juan Paez, Head of Latin America at Climate Fund Managers, said: “Access to capital for climate infrastructure remains one of the main barriers to achieving Colombia’s 2050 net zero ambition¹.”

He said: “Our partnership with Erco Energía, supported by the European Union, shows how blended finance can help bridge that gap - unlocking investment for projects that strengthen energy security and accelerate the clean energy transition.”

Alberto Menghini, Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation in Colombia, said: “The European Union is Colombia´s main energy transition partner, not only through Foreign Direct Investments, but also through financial mechanisms such as CFM’s Climate Investor One Fund.”

He said: “This approach enables transformative initiatives such as Pétalo del Norte I and Pradera, which strengthen and diversify Colombia´s energy mix while creating local jobs and opportunities.”

Juan Camilo Lopez, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Erco Energia, said: “Expanding solar generation is essential to strengthen Colombia’s energy security and resilience.”

He said: “Together with CFM, we are demonstrating how partnerships that combine local expertise with international investment and experience can accelerate that shift.”

The partners said Colombia’s dependence on hydropower leaves the grid exposed to drought, while non-conventional renewables supply less than 2% of electricity but are expanding rapidly.

They added that projects such as Pradera will improve grid reliability and reduce the need for fossil fuel back-up during dry seasons.",https://renews.biz/media/35552/petalo-solar-pv-plant-2-cfm.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-11-19 21:59:10.958949

The federal Department of Energy closed a $1 billion loan to finance the restart of a nuclear reactor at the former Three Mile Island plant, where energy will be produced to power Microsoft data centers in PJM’s transmission region.

Mark Rodgers, a spokesperson for Constellation, told the Capital-Star that the federal loan is welcome, and will help reduce overall borrowing costs for the project. He added that the reactor will be a strong source of clean energy, which will offset the added demand on the power grid created by data centers.

“We’re appreciative of [the loan],” Rodgers said. “It’ll be helpful to Constellation. And for the government, we’re going to pay it back in full with interest, so ultimately the taxpayer will get a return.”

Three Mile Island was the site of the worst nuclear power disaster in U.S. history, when one of its two reactors partially melted down in 1979, releasing some radioactive material into the surrounding environment. While long-term impacts on the health of people living nearby were minimal, the accident became a symbol for the risks of nuclear energy production in the U.S.

The other on-site reactor, which shuttered in 2019, is what will be brought back online by Constellation Energy. It’s being renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center.

“Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. “It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

The taxpayer-backed loan is financed through the Trump administration’s Energy Dominance Financing Program, which will back projects aimed at boosting energy infrastructure capacity for the U.S. Artificial Intelligence industry.

The project, however, has faced some pushback from community members who live near the reactor, some of whom lived through the 1979 incident.

At a public hearing on the reopening in July, a number of people voiced concerns about the risks of another meltdown being shouldered by Middletown and the surrounding communities in Dauphin County, while virtually all of the energy created will go towards powering data centers.

Others spoke in support of the project, with many welcoming the construction jobs it will bring and the potential positive impacts on the local economy.

c: 202.913.0126

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representatives Yvette D. Clarke (NY-09), Diana DeGette (CO-01), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Kathy Castor (FL-14), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) reintroduced the Frack Pack, a set of five bills aimed at closing loopholes that allow the oil and gas industry to skirt key environmental and public health protections. The legislative package would hold the industry accountable for pollution that threatens clean air, safe drinking water, and the health of communities across the country.

The Frack Pack includes the FRAC Act, the CLEANER Act, the FRESHER Act, the SHARED Act, and the CLOSE Act.

“When a regulatory loophole within the Clean Air Act enables fracking and other environmentally harmful practices to bring dangerous toxins and climate-changing emissions into our communities unimpeded, it’s clear legislative action is necessary to correct the shortcomings and protect public health. The ‘aggregation exemption’ has, for too long, allowed for an unacceptable status quo in climate policy in America, and it is past time for that to change,” said Rep. Yvette D. Clarke. “I am proud to introduce my legislation, the CLOSE ACT, to address this destructive exemption, just as I am proud to support the Frack Pack as a comprehensive solution towards amending the loopholes that put polluters first and leave the American people last.”

“For too long, oil and gas companies have enjoyed special exemptions from our nation’s bedrock environmental laws that no other industry gets,” said Dianne DeGette. “The Frack Pack would finally put an end to that double standard. These commonsense reforms will protect our air, water, and communities while ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the fracking process. I’m proud to work with leaders like Reps. Huffman, Castor, Schakowsky, and Clarke on these important bills.”

‘”The fossil fuel industry gets to dump their runoff into stormwater thanks to special exemptions for no good reason – polluting our water supply and putting communities at risk,” said Rep. Jared Huffman. “Why should Big Oil billionaires get to skirt the rules? They shouldn’t. The FRESHER Act closes this loophole to even the playing field and stop them from destroying communities so we can get this public health and environmental crisis under control.”

“Families deserve clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, and the CLEANER Act is a practical step to make that a reality,” said Rep. Kathy Castor. “By holding polluters accountable and closing loopholes that let dangerous toxins seep into our waterways and neighborhoods, we can make communities healthier. Encourage Congress to move this bill and build a healthier, safer future for every community.”

“Hydraulic fracking is a serious risk to our water, no matter how much Big Oil and Gas insist it is safe. The truth is, these companies are not even required to report when their fracking activity contaminates the local water supply,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky. “The SHARED Act is commonsense legislation that would require oil and gas companies to test nearby water sources and disclose the results regularly. Families deserve to know that the water coming out of their tap is safe to drink and use. I am committed to holding the fossil fuel industry accountable. Protecting our clean water is not optional; it is essential.”

The CLOSE Act would decrease toxic air pollution that comes from oil and gas exploration and production activities and add hydrogen sulfide to the list of hazardous air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. Hydrogen sulfide is an air toxic released during oil and gas exploration and production. Additionally, it would reverse the exemption of oil and gas companies from the Clean Air Act’s aggregation requirement, which allows multiple activities or facilities to be collectively permitted as one single source.

The FRAC Act would eliminate the “Halliburton Loophole,” established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, under which fracking fluids are exempted from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The FRAC Act would require fracking companies to publicly disclose the chemicals they are pumping into the ground and give the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate the process under its Underground Injection Control program. The oil and gas industry remains the only economic sector exempt from this important program.

The CLEANER Act would make oil and gas companies responsible for cleaning up and disposing of hazardous waste that comes from their operations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Subtitle C, the country’s hazardous waste management law.

The FRESHER Act closes the loophole for oil and gas companies in the Clean Water Act and creates a study to better understand the effect of stormwater runoff from oil and gas companies.

The SHARED Act would require testing for water contamination near fracking sites.

“The members of our respective caucuses hold diverse views of how Congress should improve the energy infrastructure permitting process; however, as leaders of these caucuses, we are unified in our belief that the current actions of the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are blocking us from engaging in good faith, bipartisan permitting reform negotiations.

“Any serious permitting reform package must address – as a threshold matter – the Trump Administration’s active undermining of America’s clean energy industry by using every tool it can find to slow or block projects. The Administration regularly does not follow existing law, including revoking duly issued permits, rescinding previously-awarded grants, and issuing stop work orders on projects well under construction. Over the past 10 months, we have heard outcries over the Administration’s actions from state governments, businesses, and workers responsible for building critical clean energy projects to address growing electricity demand while improving the reliability and affordability of our energy system, but our Republican colleagues in Congress have remained largely silent in the face of the Trump Administration’s abuses.

“Ensuring that clean energy projects are treated fairly and can move forward where appropriate is the prerequisite for serious, practical negotiations on a reform package capable of meeting the nation’s energy needs. Additionally, to be comfortable with any sort of agreement, we need to be able to trust that this Administration is going to follow the law that we write.

Washington, D.C. – Today, Ranking Member Huffman released a statement on the Trump administration’s announcement to push back the compliance deadline for the Methane Waste Rule, clearing the way for polluters to ignore regulations and avoid paying royalties to public and Indian mineral owners.

“Their first week back after the longest shutdown in American history, Republicans haven’t done a single thing to lower costs or improve the lives of hardworking people. Instead, they’ve prioritized rolling out the red carpet for their billionaire donors,” said Ranking Member Huffman. “Trump is shirking the law and robbing taxpayers blind so Big Oil can keep pumping out emissions without having to pay a cent for polluting our air.

“It has been proven time and again that this pollution gives our kids asthma, spikes cancer rates, and causes miscarriages. Health care prices are about to skyrocket, but instead of solving this Republican-caused crisis, they are clearing the way for corporations to keep poisoning our communities just to pad their pockets.

“Meanwhile, the rest of the world is meeting at COP to work together on curbing this exact kind of pollution to address climate change – but Trump couldn’t be bothered to show up for America. He’s surrendering to China and driving our allies straight into Xi Jinping’s arms to partner with him instead on clean, cheap energy that addresses the climate crisis. Rolling back these safeguards is a complete abdication of our responsibilities and climate leadership on the global stage. This has got to stop. Americans want clean air and clean water––not handouts to polluters.”

Background

The Bureau of Land Management announced it is pushing back deadlines for oil and gas companies to comply with the Methane Waste Rule, which tightened rules on the venting and flaring of methane from oil and gas production on federal lands.

The rule would have charged oil companies royalties for the methane their operations produce but don’t deliver to market as natural gas to compensate public and Indian mineral owners.

BLM will delay enforcement by one year for two of the rule's provisions that were scheduled to take effect on Dec. 10.

This decision is the latest in a string of attacks on the environment and public health by Republicans. On Monday, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers announced their proposed revision of the Waters of the United States, which would further restrict which water bodies are protected from pollution and destruction under the Clean Water Act. This will let polluters dump in and destroy more waters all across the country.

On Tuesday, House Republicans voted to overturn a series of federal land protections to lock the American people into higher energy costs by sabotaging clean, renewable energy to prop up polluters. The three Congressional Review Acts will handcuff the Department of the Interior, making it illegal for the agency to stop prioritizing fossil fuels -- even to protect communities from climate-induced wildfires, save collapsing habitats, or combat prolonged drought.

Combined with the rapid growth of AI-fueled data center construction, the costs are becoming harder to accurately predict.
This increased capacity comes at a cost, which is spread among all consumers, not just data centers.
Data centers also use enormous amounts of water to keep themselves cool, with some consuming as much water as a small town.
With more data centers built each year, water sources will be further strained, decreasing water quality and availability for local residents.","Big things are happening in North Louisiana. What was once acres of quiet farmland in Richland Parish, located amid sparsely populated rural towns, has been turned into a hotbed of construction. When Meta broke ground on its new $10 billion data center project, “Hyperion,” changes were immediate. In a parish (Louisiana’s version of a county) of just over 20,000 people, 5,000 out-of-state construction workers are projected to be working here at the project’s peak. The allure of jobs and economic development may be enticing, but states need to approach data centers with caution.

As flattering as it would be, Meta did not choose my home state of Louisiana as the location of its new mega-project for our great food or Southern charm. Rather, Louisiana gave Meta what it wanted in tax breaks.

Over the span of a few weeks, state legislators rewrote a bill originally for rural broadband sales tax rebates to instead subsidize data center construction. No one knows how much this will cost the state, as Louisiana enacted these data center subsidies in 2024 without producing an official cost estimate. Neither officials nor the public will know the amount of lost revenue until Meta applies for its sales tax rebates in the following years.

What’s happening in Louisiana isn’t unique. With companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI spending record-breaking amounts on data center construction, state governments are rushing to offer billions of dollars in subsidies, apparently without understanding their full costs.

According to a report by Good Jobs First, at least 10 states are already losing more than $100 million each in revenue a year from these tax breaks—money that could instead be going to early childhood and K-12 education, infrastructure, or other services. Combined with the rapid growth of AI-fueled data center construction, the costs are becoming harder to accurately predict. Texas saw its annual cost estimates grow from $130 million to over $1 billion in the span of 23 months.

Despite these heavy public investments, data centers are creating few permanent jobs. While Meta’s new data center in Louisiana is bringing in thousands of construction jobs, most of those workers will go away once the project is finished. Meta, instead, is only required to create 500 full-time jobs by 2035 to receive the maximum amount of tax breaks. Although this will be one of the largest data centers in the world, the modest target of 500 jobs is not that surprising. Data centers may take up a lot of space, but they are mostly filled with computers and electronic equipment and do not need lots of employees. One analysis finds that even large data centers generally employ less than 150 people. When all is said and done, this leaves states with an extraordinarily high cost per job created.

The costs to residents are not just fiscal. Data centers require immense amounts of electricity to keep themselves running, but states don’t have the existing infrastructure to meet these needs. In Louisiana, Entergy is building three new gas-fired power plants just for Meta’s data center, which is projected to use more than three times the electricity of New Orleans on any given day. This increased capacity comes at a cost, which is spread among all consumers, not just data centers. Some residents in other states have seen their electricity bills double and even triple over the last five years in areas with high data center activity. In places like Richland Parish, where 25 percent of people live below the poverty line, such increases would further impoverish those already struggling to make ends meet.

Data centers threaten the environment as well. Over 50 percent of energy used to power data centers comes from fossil fuels. These centers are already releasing over 100 million tons of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere each year. As in Louisiana, these numbers will increase as more fossil fuel power plants are built to meet data centers’ energy demands. Data centers also use enormous amounts of water to keep themselves cool, with some consuming as much water as a small town. With more data centers built each year, water sources will be further strained, decreasing water quality and availability for local residents.

With out-of-control tax breaks, growing consumer costs, and environmental concerns, states need to call a timeout on their data center subsidies. State and local governments should reevaluate if these subsidies are necessary, given that Meta, OpenAI, Amazon, and Google are already some of the richest companies on the planet. States need to put their own residents first to ensure that they’re protected from negative externalities of the data center industry. Otherwise, a race to the bottom, draining revenues and pocketbooks, is inevitable.","https://media.itep.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,onerror=redirect/https://media.itep.org/stock-data-center-construction-corporate-tech-subsidy-state-768x432.jpg",N,,2025-11-19 15:02:29.191995

To turn the signals from the Climate Action Agenda into accelerated action across every sector.","Below are remarks from UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, delivered at the Global Climate Action high-level closing event at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on Wednesday 19 November 2025.

Excellencies,

Colleagues, dear Friends,

We have said throughout this COP that the world is watching and willing climate cooperation to stand firm in a fractured world.

The Climate Action Agenda is showing this cooperation at work:

COP30 has racked up an impressive scorecard of real-world climate actions that will also mean stronger economies, more jobs and better lives for many millions.

A trillion-dollar charge into the clean energy and grids.

A global plan to quadruple sustainable fuel.

Moves to unlock new waves of green industry.

The pipeline for new adaptation investment, among many others.

Meanwhile in national climate plans, we are seeing whole-of-economy, and whole-of-society approaches coming to the fore.

This is transformational – unthinkable only a few years ago.

But this is no moment for self-congratulations – this is the moment to step up.

To strive for measurable, real-world results for people, for economies, and for the planet.

This is the Climate Action Agenda.

I want to acknowledge the COP30 Presidency for its clarity of purpose as we work to ensure the Action Agenda works hand-in-hand with the formal negotiations process.

This alignment matters deeply.

It is helping ministers and ministries design climate plans rooted in practical solutions that cut emissions and strengthen resilience; helping governments unlock jobs, investment, cleaner air, and more secure, affordable energy for your citizens, businesses and vital services like hospitals and schools.

The Climate Action Agenda is not a nice-to-have on the side. It is mission critical, and a key part of the Paris Agreement.

I have said many times that, in this new era, we must strive to bring the formal COP process closer to the real economy, for faster implementation, and to spread the vast benefits to billions more people.

The Climate Action Agenda enables and harnesses the momentum we are seeing in the real economy.

And it shows that the work of negotiators and the work of the real economy can and must work together to deliver the Paris Agreement.

This is no accident. For [a decade], the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action has been essential for a global ecosystem of non-Party stakeholders, and it can – it will – do much more.

It has brought together businesses, cities, regions, investors, civil society, including Indigenous Peoples – helping sustain momentum, share innovation, and keep ambition rising even in the toughest of geopolitical conditions.

That collaborative architecture has never been more essential.

It is the bridge that connects national ambition to local action, global goals to community realities.

It has been strengthened immeasurably by the leadership of our Climate High-Level Champions, Nigar and Dan.

Your work with the 5-year vision provides the continuity and inclusivity required for the future of this agenda.

You have been indispensable partners – to the process, to the Presidency, and to the UNFCCC secretariat. Count on me and my team to accompany you and future Champions in this journey to make this vision a reality. Thank you.

Colleagues, this Climate Action Agenda is a central catalyst for implementation: where multilevel governance and cooperation between governments and non-Party actors accelerates us towards our goals.

The responsibility now lies with all of us – Parties and non-Parties, public and private sectors, national and subnational implementers – to deliver results fast, fairly, and at scale.

Because people everywhere deserve to have the benefits of climate action: better health, more resilient communities, greater security and prosperity.

And because every moment of delay is far too costly.

So let us close the gap between commitments and delivery that protects and improves people’s lives.

To turn the signals from the Climate Action Agenda into accelerated action across every sector.

And to show the world that climate cooperation stands firm, serving the interests of every nation, every economy and every person.

I thank you.",https://unfccc.int/themes/custom/unfccc/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-19 16:01:02.199003

Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued an air quality permit to Homer City Generation yesterday, clearing the way for construction of what could become one of the nation’s largest gas-fired power plants.

The department originally projected a decision on the permit by August 2026, 285 days from the application date, and made it in just 157 days. As the commonwealth prioritizes fast-tracked permits, the accelerated process is a win for developers — but environmental groups opposed to the plan say that carbon and toxic air pollution from the site could harm nearby residents.

“This was not an unexpected [decision],” Alex Bomstein, executive director of the Clean Air Council, told Technical.ly soon after the decision was released. “However, the speed with which DEP rushed this permit through, especially given the magnitude of the pollution and the number of people who are going to die because of it, is troubling.”

The proposed $10 billion project for the Homer City Energy Campus would redevelop a former coal-burning power plant site in Indiana County to deliver up to 4.4 gigawatts for the on-site data centers and local homes, according to the Homer City Redevelopment group.

Despite project leads touting economic wins, environmental groups argue that air pollution from the power plant will exacerbate the climate crisis, and the data centers will drive up the cost of electricity.

Homer City Redevelopment did not respond to multiple requests to comment on the project or the recently issued permit.

Communities speak up about the project

Over 500 responses were submitted during the public comment period for the permit. Residents, especially in rural areas, have spoken out about data centers because of pollution, stress on the groundwater and high energy usage.

When asked about the decision, DEP pointed to its public comment responses. By issuing the permit, the agency is confirming the proposed project adheres to air quality requirements and will use the best available technology to mitigate environmental concerns.

Homer City Redevelopment has said the project’s gas turbines will cut emissions by up to 65% compared to the former coal plant and that the campus will be a major economic opportunity for Indiana County. The company projects over 10,000 temporary construction jobs and roughly 1,000 permanent positions in energy and tech once the campus is operational.

Despite possible gains, the Clean Air Council said the pollution, potential noise, odor and compromised drinking water from the data center campus would mean minimal return benefits for the surrounding community.

“This illegal permit is a death sentence for many of those who will breathe its toxic fumes in Indiana County and across the nation,” Bomstein said. “Rushed-through, riddled with errors and for what? It’s not to keep our lights on. It’s for New York hedge fund investors and for tech billionaires to get rich off of technology designed to lay people off.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Homer-city-energy-campus.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 16:02:36.785791

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reported on October 9 that EcoFlow Technology has received six reports of the recalled Power Stations catching fire, with property damage totaling over $850,000.

The recall involves EcoFlow Delta Max 2000 Model EFD310 Power Stations. These power stations are black and silver, with a rectangular LCD display screen on the front and six electrical outlets on the back. “ECOFLOW MAX” is printed on the right side. “EFD310” and “EcoFlow DELTA Max (2000)” are printed on the nameplate on the underside of the product. They were sold at Costco.com, Amazon.com and Ecoflow.com from July 2022 through May 2025 for about $1,600.

In its October announcement, CPSC said that consumers should immediately stop using the recalled power stations and contact EcoFlow Technology for instructions on installing a free repair in the form of a firmware update. It also noted that the affected power stations may overheat and ignite, posing a risk of serious burn injury and fire hazard.

On Wednesday, the company’s spokesperson told ESS News: “The recall notice applies to DELTA Max 2000 units sold in the US, however, we have made the firmware update available globally. Compensation is handled and determined by the third-party insurance provider. We will fully assist our customers throughout the claims process to ensure their rights and interests are protected.”

Asked to explain what went wrong with the affacted devices, the spokesperson said that it was found that “in rare cases, operating the device in high-temperature, humid conditions and poorly ventilated environments increased the risk of overheating”.

“While the number of units affected is extremely limited, we are issuing this safety notice out of an abundance of caution to protect all of our customers. The situation is not caused by a hardware defect, but rather by logic triggers under certain conditions. The firmware update optimizes the control logic allowing the device to better handle extreme conditions,” the spokesperson explained.

The firmware update has been approved by the CPSC and there is no physical recall of the product. In the meantime, EcoFlow has also implemented proactive quality control measures.

“Through the EcoFlow App and firmware, we now monitor cell status in real time. If abnormal temperatures are detected, the system will display a warning icon and we will proactively contact the user to arrange a replacement. We take this matter very seriously and are committed to the safety and reliability of our products,” the spokesperson said.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ecoflow-1.png,N,,2025-11-19 17:01:06.333177

As the world accelerates toward net-zero, the global energy transition is triggering an unprecedented surge in demand for critical minerals — from copper and cobalt to manganese, platinum-group metals, graphite, and rare earth elements. These minerals are essential building blocks for solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, transmission grids, hydrogen technologies, and battery storage.

With some of the world’s richest reserves, Africa is emerging as a pivotal supplier of these transition – critical materials. The 2026 Africa Energy Indaba will place this issue as a key discussion as part of its strategic agenda, highlighting Africa’s dual role as both a growing energy market and a global minerals powerhouse.

A Global Race for Critical Minerals

According to the IEA, demand for many critical minerals will double or even triple by 2030 due to the rapid expansion of clean-energy technologies.

The Guardian reports that global copper demand is rising sharply, with the IEA warning of “structural supply risks” unless mining and processing capacity expands significantly.

The shift toward electric mobility and renewables is expected to increase demand for cobalt by up to six-fold, lithium by seven-fold, and nickel by three-fold by 2040 under the IEA’s sustainable development scenario.

Africa Holds Extraordinary Mineral Wealth

Africa’s resource endowment positions the continent at the centre of the global clean-tech supply chain:

The Democratic Republic of Congo produces over 70% of the world’s cobalt.

South Africa holds about 80% of global platinum-group metal reserves, crucial for hydrogen electrolysers and fuel cells.

Zambia and the DRC collectively account for roughly 10% of global copper reserves.

Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, and Namibia have rapidly growing graphite and rare – earth deposits.

Southern Africa controls more than a third of the world’s high-grade manganese.

These resources give Africa enormous leverage in shaping the trajectory of global decarbonisation —

but they also highlight the need for smart policy, ethical extraction, and stronger local beneficiation.

Turning Mineral Wealth into Industrialisation

While Africa is rich in resources, most minerals are exported as raw materials, with minimal in-country value addition. The 2026 Africa Energy Indaba will spotlight the need for a new, strategic approach:

Local processing and refining to retain value, create jobs, and promote industrial diversification.

Regional value-chain development to support battery manufacturing, green hydrogen systems, and component production for renewable energy technologies.

Sustainable and responsible mining frameworks to ensure environmental protection, community benefits, and improved governance.

Cross-border infrastructure investment, including energy, logistics, and transportation systems, to unlock mining corridors and mineral-processing hubs.

A Central Discussion Topic at the 2026 Africa Energy Indaba

At the 2026 Indaba, Critical Minerals & the Green Transition will be a key focus topic, convening key voices from:

African governments & policymakers

Mining and energy companies

Global clean-tech manufacturers & investors

DFIs, ESG standards bodies, and supply-chain auditors

Researchers and local industrialisation experts

The Session will explore:

How Africa can secure a fair share of value in global clean-energy supply chains

Strategies to attract sustainable capital for mineral extraction and processing

Building battery, hydrogen, and renewable-energy manufacturing ecosystems

Policies that ensure a just, inclusive, and environmentally responsible mining sector

Partnerships to strengthen African-led value chains from mine to market

A Defining Opportunity for Africa

Africa is not just a destination for clean-energy investment — it is a critical engine of the global energy transition. As demand for minerals soars, the continent stands at a historic crossroads: remain a raw – material exporter or move boldly into industrialisation, beneficiation, and advanced manufacturing. The 2026 Africa Energy Indaba will offer a platform for decision-makers to shape this future, accelerate value-chain integration, and drive sustainable, Africa-centred growth.",https://africaenergyindaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Critical-Minerals-the-Green-Transition.png,N,,2025-11-19 17:00:50.114286

U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped an immigrant worker Monday in Charlotte. The man showed agents a photo of his federal employment permit, but not the actual document. So they detained him.

The two attorneys at Tedesco Legal, a Charlotte firm that specializes in immigration law, took the man’s case pro bono on a referral from a fellow attorney. Late Tuesday afternoon, from their offices in a co-working space south of the city center, Mary Lynn Tedesco and Anna Cushman were still trying to figure out where he’d been taken.

A half-hour later, Cushman’s phone rang. She excused herself and hustled out of her office.

“That was the mom of the client that I’m trying to track down,” Cushman explained when she returned about five minutes later. “I told Mom, ‘I want to know where he is. If you get any information, let me know.’

“It’s a little bit of a shell game, because [immigration officials] can move them wherever they want,” Cushman said. “That ICE Detainee Locator would be the most official way,” she noted, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is usually the agency that picks up immigrants in an inland city. “But I don’t necessarily trust things coming out of the mouths of ICE agents.”

In this case, the agency conducting sweeps is Customs and Border Protection, a different division of the Department of Homeland Security that does not follow the same protocols. Tuesday was the fourth day of what CBP has dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web” in Mecklenburg County. It also appeared to have expanded to the Triangle on Tuesday.

After less than a week in the Queen City, the “surge,” as DHS described it, had forced multiple businesses in Latino neighborhoods to close; led to a near-tripling of absences in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools; and inspired protests and demonstrations.

Tedesco and Cushman are among dozens of local immigration attorneys fielding urgent calls, emails, and texts from panicked clients and their relatives, trying to give them the best information and advice they can in an ever-changing environment.

“You are on a long road in immigration. … But remembering it’s a long road is helpful, too, in times of crisis,” Cushman said. “We’ve been training for this since the beginning.”

DHS Claims 200+ Arrested in Charlotte

DHS said Tuesday that the Charlotte operation had detained more than 200 people since Saturday in what the department describes in a news release as an effort to “Target Criminal Illegal Aliens Terrorizing Americans.”

“I started getting emails about 8, 8:15 Saturday morning: ‘My brother was picked up. My dad was picked up,’” said Tedesco, a 36-year-old New Jersey native who opened her firm in 2020 and hired Cushman in September. “And these are existing clients.”

More followed, and she directed her paralegal to devote her time to fielding calls. The firm had about 250 clients, about a dozen of them pro bono; Tedesco and Cushman already had a full load.

By Tuesday, they were swamped. Cushman described their work as “frenetic.” Tedesco described falling asleep at about 9:15 p.m. Monday as she read a bedtime story to her 5-year-old daughter.

Cushman, 38, has twin 4-year-olds, a boy and a girl. She said she was up late Monday night and back up early Tuesday morning, toggling between posts to a Signal thread among immigration lawyers. “We’ve just got lots of moving pieces,” she said, “even on a normal day.”

Their advice varied with each client. But their basic message for anyone confronted by Border Patrol agents, Tedesco said: “If you’re documented, have your papers. Show that you are lawfully in the United States, and then say, ‘I am lawfully here in the United States. Am I free to leave?’

“If you’re not free to leave, you call us, because at that point you should be, in theory, entitled to a lawyer. If not, are there other violations of constitutional rights going on? Probably.” Undocumented immigrants, she said, should try to stay home unless it’s an emergency: “I’ve kind of told people to lay low.”

People who need an attorney, she added, can contact Carolina Migrant Network, a Charlotte-based nonprofit that provides legal services to immigrants in removal proceedings.

A few minutes later, Tedesco excused herself to catch up on “a stack of about 20 messages.”

The Cost of Confusion

Cushman is a Charlotte native whose paternal grandmother, Dr. Jonnie McLeod, founded what’s now a substance abuse treatment center network. “I love her legacy. She always saw the good in people, even in marginalized groups,” Cushman said. “So, for me, who is the group on the margins that I really want to make a difference for? It’s immigrants.”

Tedesco said she developed an interest in immigration law while in college at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. She majored in Spanish, which required study of civil wars, drug violence, and American political intervention in Central America in the 1980s.

Both attorneys said they were somewhat accustomed to ICE detainers of one or two individuals. But the Border Patrol operation over the past few days has been much different.

“The tactics used by ICE to arrest and detain people are not the same as an indiscriminate, militarized group in vans and trucks going around and hitting people in public places,” Tedesco said. “It’s not the same large scale: ‘I’m gonna post up at a Home Depot parking lot and grab anyone who looks Latino.’”

DHS did not respond to a request for comment about their operations on Tuesday night.

And the attorneys still weren’t clear as of Tuesday about where people who are detained are being taken. Communication with them is limited or nonexistent. They named three ICE detention centers in Georgia and one in Louisiana where they believe DHS may be busing detainees from Charlotte, but they were still trying to confirm it.

They emphasized that even legal immigrants’ knowledge of their rights and the law is no guarantee that officers will respect them. Release without criminal charges from an ICE facility can take weeks or even months, irreparably damaging people’s lives, Cushman said: “You can’t un-ring the bell on the harm.”

This would be an expansion of the company’s magnet production capacity, establishing the world’s largest magnet factory outside China. The company has promised to create 1,000 new jobs in Johnston County. The company also recently announced a $1.4 billion partnership with the federal government.

“The confidence that Vulcan Elements has to expand to Johnston County is proof that we have the right assets to help innovative start-ups scale their businesses,” said Stein in a press release. “With semiconductor chips, batteries, and now magnets, North Carolina is building an innovation and manufacturing hub that will drive the economy of the future.”

The expansion will be partially funded by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by North Carolina’s Economic Investment Committee on Nov. 18. The project is estimated to contribute $2.6 billion to the state economy over a 12-year term. A formula that takes into account the new tax revenue generated by the latest jobs and capital investment, a potential reimbursement to the company of $17,584,500 over 12 years is authorized by the JDIG agreement. State payments are only made upon annual verification by the Departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its job creation and investment targets.

“Today, we are the North American market leader in EV lithium-ion battery cells,"" says Yasuaki Takamoto, CEO of Panasonic Energy Corporation for North America.
Production at the Kansas factory benefits from more than 30 years of lithium-ion battery manufacturing experience and eight years of operational insights from the Nevada facility.
“The Kansas factory will build a sustainable future and provide more opportunities as Panasonic works to respond to global demand,” says Yuki Kusumi, Group CEO of Panasonic Holdings Corporation.","Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially from the transport sector, which produces about 23% of global emissions.

Of that, road transport makes up 69%, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. That reality pushes companies like Panasonic Energy to strengthen EV supply chains while supporting decarbonisation efforts.

Panasonic Energy Co has opened its second North American automotive battery production base in De Soto, Kansas, producing cylindrical lithium-ion batteries, known as “2170” cells, for EVs. The factory joins the company’s existing Nevada site as part of a two-pillar strategy to anchor production in both Japan and North America.

The Kansas factory stretches across 1.2 million square metres, making it one of the largest EV battery manufacturing sites in North America. But beyond size, this facility marks a deeper investment in local supply chains, cleaner production and regional development.

“This factory will produce our latest generation 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells, and our customers will soon benefit from these cells produced right here in Kansas.”

Strengthening EV supply chains

Panasonic Energy's Kansas site reflects a shift towards a more localised and sustainable supply chain model.

With more than 80% of a lithium-ion battery's carbon footprint coming from upstream activities, such as raw material extraction and processing, the company targets local sourcing and material reuse to help reduce environmental impact.

The company aims to cut the carbon footprint (CFP) of its automotive batteries by 50% by fiscal 2031 compared to fiscal 2022. This includes introducing recycled materials, lowering use of rare metals and adapting production processes. CFP is measured by the total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 terms across a product’s lifecycle.

Production at the Kansas factory benefits from more than 30 years of lithium-ion battery manufacturing experience and eight years of operational insights from the Nevada facility. Panasonic Energy improves factory productivity by 20% through efficient layout and automation. Battery capacity is also set to rise by around 5% thanks to new materials, keeping the company competitive in the expanding EV market.

The expansion supports Panasonic Group’s environmental strategy, “Panasonic GREEN IMPACT,” and its “CONTRIBUTION IMPACT” pillar, which focuses on reducing CO2 emissions within business activities.

“The Kansas factory will build a sustainable future and provide more opportunities as Panasonic works to respond to global demand,” says Yuki Kusumi, Group CEO of Panasonic Holdings Corporation.

“Through job creation, collaboration with academic institutions, and technological innovation, this factory symbolises building the future together with the local community. That is a source of pride for Panasonic.”

Economic impact and job creation

Beyond batteries, the Kansas factory delivers regional development on an unprecedented scale. This includes 4,000 direct jobs and around 8,000 additional positions through suppliers and affiliated companies. The annual economic contribution to the state reaches US$2.5bn.

Kristen Walters, Vice President of Human Resources at Panasonic Energy Corporation of North America, says: “We’re not just building a factory; we’re creating a future for generations of people, investing in talent and community to build the world’s most advanced technologies.”

Panasonic works with the University of Kansas and other local institutions to train specialists and develop battery technologies, addressing local workforce gaps and keeping skilled talent in the state.

In a region where agriculture dominates, many young people have previously left after college. Now, the factory offers them a reason to stay.

Panasonic’s community efforts include education initiatives supported by local officials, and outreach led by brand ambassador Katie Ledecky. Her visit to students at the Cedar Trails Exploration Center in Lenexa highlights the company’s focus on inspiring future engineers and scientists.

“Panasonic’s decision to locate this plant near De Soto is a stamp of approval we appreciate,” says US Senator Jerry Moran.

“This investment is a bright indication of what Kansans can achieve and will offer the world – creating new career opportunities in advanced manufacturing and technology.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ec9cdb40f640f0e6a0ee6a4631182387:3f3c405ab7b75f2d82c427cfd336ca56/kansas-rendering-1.webp.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 15:01:21.770679

The new “American Energy Dominance” policy is purpose-built to throttle down on the two most available, economical, and accessible energy resources in the US — namely, wind and solar power. However, signs of a policy failure are already written on the wind, so to speak, as the demand for renewable energy shows no sign of slowing down.

The First-Ever Utility-Scale Wind Farm In Arkansas

This year’s abrupt shift in federal energy policy brought much grief to renewable energy advocates and investors, particularly in the offshore wind industry. US President Donald Trump has single-handedly pulled the rug out from under a bubbling pipeline of offshore wind farms along the Atlantic coast by deploying the federal government’s authority over offshore lease areas.

A few projects have managed to trickle through the blockade, but others gave up the ghost, the latest example being Invenergy’s decision to cut itself loose from the proposed 2.4-gigawatt Leading Light Wind project off the coast of New Jersey.

The onshore wind industry is in somewhat better shape, though not much better. Earlier this year, the President closed off federal lands to renewable energy developers. A growing web of state and county-based restrictions on wind and solar farms is also blocking the door.

Given those obstacles, the first-ever utility scale wind farm in Arkansas is a breakthrough moment for renewable energy, potentially signaling a fresh wave of growth shortly after — if not before — the current occupant of the White House leaves office as scheduled. On November 18, the Canadian renewable energy developer Cordelio Power announced the start of commercial operations for its Crossover Wind project, a 135-megawatt wind farm in Cross County.

Follow The Money

To be clear, the Crossover wind farm was already underway before the latest round of renewable energy restrictions entered force in Arkansas. Development of the site launched back in 2020 under the umbrella of Vestas North America through its Steelhead Americas branch, and then Cordelio acquired it towards the end of 2023.

Still, Cordelio’s Chief Development Officer, Nick Karambelas, made a point of thanking the Cross County community for its support. “Cordelio is committed to working with local communities within Arkansas to create economic growth and reliable electricity and Crossover marks an important milestone as we advance additional projects across the state,” Karambelas said in a press statement.

“We’re especially thankful for the strong collaboration from Cross County officials, landowners, and the broader community, which has been instrumental in bringing this project to life,” he emphasized.

If money talks — and it does — landowners in Cross County were listening. Collectively, they stand to haul in more than $50 million in lease payments over the lifespan of the project. Local taxpayers will also benefit. The project will pump about $950,000 per year into the coffers of Cross County for the life of the project.

More Renewable Energy For Arkansas

Arkansas lawmakers who voted for new restrictions on renewable energy development may be taking another look at their decision in light of the many dollars contributed to the local economy by the new Crossover wind farm. After all, times are tough. It’s not easy to pass up a new, risk-free, non-polluting source of local revenue.

Once the cash starts flowing from the new Crossover project, taxpayers in neighboring counties may start demanding answers from their elected officials. That remains to be seen, but Cordelio has already laid plans for additional projects across the state, as Karambelas mentioned. As for how many, that information was not released on November 18. However, one hint of things to come is the size of Cordelio’s renewable energy portfolio currently under management and operation in the US and Canada, which totals 1.86 gigawatts. That sounds impressive enough, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the company’s future plans for the US alone, with a development pipeline that currently stands at 18 gigawatts.

Cordelio is not the only renewable energy stakeholder to seek opportunities in Arkansas. In August, the Arkansas Times took a deep dive into the pushback against renewable energy in Arkansas, in which it referred to two additional utility-scale wind projects working their way through a maze of restrictions, including the nearly complete, 180-megawatt Nimbus wind farm in Carroll County.

The Nimbus project launched in 2016 under the umbrella of the firm Scout Clean Energy and is expected to begin commercial operations in 2026. When that happens, landowners will begin tapping into a total of $15 million over the life of the project, with another $31.5 million going to Carroll County. For the record, Scout’s development pipeline totals 19 gigawatts, eclipsing its current 1-gigawatt portfolio by a wide margin.

The Americas branch of the leading German firm RWE is behind the other wind farm mentioned by the Arkansas Times. To be located in Searcy County, that project is in the early stages of development, with land leases signed and public engagement underway. As reported by the Arkansas Times, RWE aims to build local support for the project by giving local officials and residents an up-close look at one of its many wind projects in Texas, where landowners and taxpayers are enjoying millions in new revenue.

Regardless of the revenue opportunities, that’s going to be a tough row to hoe. In addition to facing off against anti-wind activists in Arkansas who spent years honing their skills against the on-again, off-again Grain Belt Express, RWE may have to navigate state-based setback restrictions under the new Wind Energy Development Act.

On the other hand, Arkansas Times reporter Phillip Powell notes that RWE and local landowners may be able to weaponize the state’s “Right To Farm” law, which outlines the rights of property owners in regards to revenue-earning opportunities.

More Renewable Energy For The USA

Signs of recovering momentum are also evident in the US solar industry. In one particularly interesting bit of news, earlier today the Virginia-based startup SolaREIT announced that it has shot past the $5 billion project value milestone. The company specializes in helping renewable energy developers acquire the financing to procure sites for their projects. SolaREIT launched in 2020 with a single deal worth just $134,000. The company quickly raced up to the $3 billion mark last year and proceeded to pummel its way through another $2 billion in deals to date, bringing the collective generating capacity of its financed projects to 3 gigawatts.

REIT is industry shorthand for Real Estate Investment Trust, a type of real estate investment firm established in the 1960s to help make financing more accessible to small-scale investors. “SolaREIT’s financing solutions are designed specifically for solar and energy storage developers and asset owners looking to monetize land or lease value, reduce lease costs, or create liquidity for interconnection, equipment, and development expenses,” the company explains.

Hold on to your hats. Despite the partisan political headwinds blowing against renewable energy, SolaREITT CFO/COO Laura Klein does not foresee a hitch in the company’s growth curve. “Reaching this milestone so quickly underscores the strength of our model and the vital role SolaREIT plays in accelerating the nation’s transition to clean energy,” Klein explains.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wind-farm-arkansas-cordelio.png,N,,2025-11-19 17:01:56.755244

Brad Schneider, released the following statement in response to the current status of permitting reform negotiations in Congress:

“The members of our respective caucuses hold diverse views of how Congress should improve the energy infrastructure permitting process; however, as leaders of these caucuses, we are unified in our belief that the current actions of the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are blocking us from engaging in good-faith, bipartisan permitting reform negotiations.

“Any serious permitting reform package must address—as a threshold matter—the Trump Administration’s active undermining of America’s clean energy industry by using every tool it can find to slow or block projects. The Administration regularly does not follow existing law, including revoking duly issued permits, rescinding previously awarded grants, and issuing stop-work orders on projects well under construction. Over the past 10 months, we have heard outcries over the Administration’s actions from state governments, businesses, and workers responsible for building critical clean energy projects to address growing electricity demand while improving the reliability and affordability of our energy system, but our Republican colleagues in Congress have remained largely silent in the face of the Trump Administration’s abuses.

“Ensuring that clean energy projects are treated fairly and can move forward where appropriate is the prerequisite for serious, practical negotiations on a reform package capable of meeting the nation’s energy needs. Additionally, to be comfortable with any sort of agreement, we need to be able to trust that this Administration is going to follow the law that we write.

The partnership aims to support the expansion of solar and wind energy while ensuring that the rapid growth of both industries aligns with environmental, social, and governance standards.

Both organizations said the memorandum of understanding seeks to address risks developing in renewable energy supply chains as countries accelerate clean energy deployment to meet climate goals. GWEC is developing the Wind Sustainability Initiative, a multistakeholder effort modeled on the SSI framework, to establish ESG and traceability standards for the wind sector. Under the agreement, SSI will share its experience in designing sustainability benchmarks to support the creation of the new wind-focused framework.

As part of the collaboration, the organizations will promote alignment between solar and wind ESG practices while allowing for sector-specific requirements. They will also support governance structures that involve industry groups, civil society, and financial institutions to improve supply chain oversight. Both initiatives aim to help suppliers, offtakers, and developers meet rising due diligence expectations as regulatory bodies in major markets adopt stricter disclosure and sourcing rules.

The partnership takes shape as governments require proof of responsible sourcing in solar and wind components, including minerals, metals, and intermediate materials. Developers and utilities increasingly face compliance obligations on traceability to maintain access to financing, tax incentives, and export markets. The organizations said harmonizing expectations across both industries will help reduce duplicative audits and ease adoption among suppliers operating in multiple segments of the renewable energy value chain.

Officials from both groups noted that the expansion of solar and wind manufacturing capacity has increased scrutiny of global supply chains. Several countries are considering new reporting requirements tied to human rights, emissions data, and environmental performance, creating pressure on manufacturers to demonstrate transparency. The partnership aims to prepare companies for these shifts and reduce the risk of compliance gaps that could affect project approvals.

The agreement also reflects growing emphasis on responsible growth in the renewable energy sector as markets integrate larger volumes of clean power. Industry groups argue that strengthening supply chain oversight improves long-term investment certainty, supports financing, and reduces the risk of sanctions or trade restrictions linked to non-compliance. By establishing shared standards, the organizations expect to streamline expectations for global suppliers and reduce fragmentation across markets.

Mexico stands to be directly affected by the push for supply chain transparency due to its role as a growing hub for renewable energy manufacturing and project development. The country hosts assembly operations for solar components, grid equipment, and wind-related manufacturing, and its industrial sector increasingly serves North American clean energy markets. As Mexico expands its participation in regional supply chains tied to the United States and Canada, it will face rising expectations to demonstrate traceability and environmental compliance in line with emerging standards.

Mexico’s energy sector is also seeing renewed interest in wind and solar deployment as large industrial consumers seek to meet emissions targets and secure long-term power supply. Harmonized sustainability benchmarks could help developers operating in Mexico meet cross-border reporting requirements and lower risks associated with international procurement. For manufacturers, the new partnership may accelerate moves to adopt ESG auditing practices and invest in transparent sourcing systems to maintain competitiveness in North American and global markets.

The agreement between SSI and GWEC is expected to influence procurement decisions across the region, including in Mexico’s industrial corridors, where companies increasingly rely on renewable energy contracts. As supply chain standards evolve, market participants in Mexico will likely face additional documentation requirements related to materials, labor practices, and emissions data. Industry groups in the country have already said that meeting international sustainability criteria is becoming a determinant for attracting investment, particularly in export-oriented manufacturing operations.

Mexico’s regulatory shifts, including new norms on energy planning and climate reporting, may align with the broader global trend toward verifiable sustainability metrics. Companies participating in Mexico’s renewable energy projects could benefit from having consistent and internationally recognized frameworks as they adapt to new expectations from global buyers and financing institutions.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-11/connected-logistics-and-supply-chain-concept-tabl-2025-03-10-13-03-54-utc%20%281%29.jpg?h=20141435&itok=OxX9kuQb,N,,2025-11-19 15:01:29.930317

As well as powering economic growth, the development of the hub supports the UK’s energy security ambitions and the drive for net zero. It demonstrates what can be achieved when organisations work together with a shared vision.

Delivery of our mission is all about freeing up our land so it can be used to benefit the local community, environment and wider economy and I can think of few better examples when it comes to realising that goal.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Chapelcross has powered the south of Scotland for decades and now is being given new life with this clean energy hub, creating jobs and revitalising local communities.

This is evidence of the UK Government’s clean energy transition in practice - creating good jobs and reindustrialising and investing in communities across Scotland and the UK

Chapelcross is a former nuclear power plant which forms part of the NDA estate, the body tasked by the government with decommissioning the UK’s earliest nuclear sites safely, securely and sustainably.

The focus of the CX Power development is 135 acres of the available land within the unlicensed landholding of the estate, adjacent to the former nuclear power site and wider nuclear licensed area.

Their plans include potential for a 1GW data centre campus with a zero-carbon target in its energy operation. The scheme looks to harness the 3GW of renewable energy supplies within fifty miles of the site and the 1.2GW of planned and consented wind and solar developments in the region. In addition, the data centres would utilise advanced cooling technologies that don’t place a burden on water resources and strive to achieve full water neutrality.

CX Power CEO, Graeme Anderson, said:

We’re thrilled to join the programme team. This is an opportunity to build a new economy based on the abundance of local green energy production. Embracing the UK’s natural wind and solar energy resources to actively support our national grid rather than burden it.

It’ll also open up opportunities for skills development and knowledge exchange creating a powerful force for change in the local economy, the Borderlands and Scotland.

CX Power join a number of strategic partners delivering the wider programme including Dumfries & Galloway Council, NDA, Nuclear Restoration Services (NRS), South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE) and Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.

Rob Fletcher, CEO Nuclear Restoration Services, commented:

The Chapelcross green energy hub represents a bold step towards a more sustainable future - and we’re proud to play our part in making that vision a reality. This programme is not only about transforming a former nuclear site, but about creating opportunities that will benefit communities for generations to come.

By working alongside CX Power and the strategic partner team, we’re helping to unlock innovation in hydrogen, advanced manufacturing and digital technologies, while supporting net zero goals. It’s a milestone that reflects collaboration, commitment and the shared belief that NDA land can power progress.

The masterplan will be a significant contributor to the 2045 Net Zero ambitions of Scotland and support Dumfries and Galloway’s ambition to achieve Net Zero by 2040.

Leader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Cllr Stephen Thompson, said:

It is a testament to partnership working to reach this significant milestone in the development of Chapelcross.

We look forward to working closely with CX Power and our partners to deliver a project that will bring real and lasting benefits to Dumfries and Galloway. The Chapelcross Green Energy Hub will be able to create high-quality jobs and attract new skills to our area, but can also play a vital role in supporting our ambitious transition to net zero.

This is a unique opportunity to harness the potential of Chapelcross for communities, economy and environment, and we are committed to ensuring that local people and businesses are a key part of the positive impact this development will have for years to come.

South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE) is also taking forward an Energy Transition Zone on land adjacent to the main Chapelcross site, which will aim to generate jobs and inward investment focussed on the transition to green energy production.

Jane Morrison-Ross, Chief Executive of South of Scotland Enterprise, said:

We warmly welcome the appointment of the strategic developer for the main Chapelcross site, marking a significant milestone for the South of Scotland.

Our region has seen a remarkable 400% increase in inward investment enquiries. The development at Chapelcross will be a cornerstone in attracting even more investors and creating new opportunities for our businesses and communities.

At SOSE, we are proud to be driving our Energy Transition Zone, which will help unlock the main Chapelcross site’s full potential. The progress with plans for a green hydrogen facility in the Energy Transition Zone is particularly exciting, and we look forward to working with all partners to deliver a sustainable and prosperous future for the region.

Chapelcross is a former nuclear power plant near Annan and is one of thirteen sites across the UK being decommissioned by NRS, a subsidiary of the NDA.

CX Power will be prioritising securing necessary planning consents and utility connections and undertaking market engagement. They invite stakeholders and interested parties to engage with them via enquiries@gaconsultants.co.uk.

The five-bill package, dubbed the “Frack Pack,” aims to hold oil and gas companies accountable to national standards for air and water quality.
It would also eliminate the so-called Halliburton Loophole, which has exempted fracking fluids from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act since 2005.
The package will serve as a form of Democratic counterprogramming to House Republicans’ efforts this week to support oil and gas production.

A group of Democrats are reviving a package of bills that would tighten federal regulations for oil and gas drilling, in a rebuttal to expected votes in the House to shore up the energy industry this week.

The five-bill package, dubbed the “Frack Pack,” aims to hold oil and gas companies accountable to national standards for air and water quality. It would also eliminate the so-called Halliburton Loophole, which has exempted fracking fluids from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act since 2005.

“What all of us are hoping is that this will make the oil and gas industry comply with the same environmental regulations as anybody else,” said Rep. Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat and the sponsor of the “Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act.”

“If we’re going to be drilling, and if we’re going to be leaning in on drilling, we need to make sure we’re not contaminating our aquifers with harmful chemicals,” DeGette said.

Bills in the Frack Pack, shared first with POLITICO’s E&E News, are sponsored by DeGette and Reps. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.).

The package will serve as a form of Democratic counterprogramming to House Republicans’ efforts this week to support oil and gas production. Lawmakers are set to vote on a spate of Republican-sponsored bills and resolutions focused on refineries, gas exports and drilling restrictions.

But the Democrats' bills are unlikely to get floor votes this Congress. A variation of the Frack Pack was first introduced in 2009, and the bills have been reintroduced regularly since then without gaining much traction, thanks in part to strong opposition from oil and gas industry groups.

DeGette said the Republican majority’s expected opposition to the legislation is irrelevant to the stated goals of the legislative push.

“This Congress is the least productive Congress ever, I think, and the Republicans don’t seem to be prioritizing the environment,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t continue to push for environmental compliance, especially when we’re talking about safe drinking water.”

DeGette’s home state of Colorado was among the first states to implement hydraulic fracturing, the controversial innovation that drove a boom in American oil and gas production. A new oil and gas project proposed near her Denver district has generated local pushback over concerns about potential health risks.

She pointed to language in the ""FRAC Act"" that would close the Halliburton Loophole, requiring companies to publicly disclose which chemicals they are putting in the ground to help extract gas while authorizing EPA to regulate that process.

“The problem is, if you don’t have a disclosure requirement, you have no idea what is in this fracking fluid; you just have to go on the assurances that the industry is making,” DeGette said. “That’s not the way our regulatory system works.”

Another part of the package, the “Closing Loopholes and Ending Arbitrary and Needless Evasion of Regulations (CLEANER) Act” would eliminate certain exemptions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and require oil and gas companies to clean up and dispose of more of their waste. The bill is sponsored by Castor, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy.

The “Focused Reduction of Effluence and Stormwater Runoff Through Hydrofracking Environmental Regulation (FRESHER) Act” is sponsored by Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.

It would require a study on the effects of stormwater runoff from oil and gas extraction sites. It would also require drilling companies to make plans to prevent that runoff from polluting streams and acquire certain permits.

Schakowsky’s “Safe Hydration Is an American Right in Energy Development (SHARED) Act” would require fracking companies to test for water contamination near their drilling sites and to produce reports on the impact their activity has on water quality.

The “Closing Loopholes for Oil and Other Sources of Emissions (CLOSE) Act,” from Clarke, would make oil and gas companies subject to the Clean Air Act’s aggregation requirement, according to a bill summary. It would also add hydrogen sulfide to the list of air pollutants considered hazardous under the Clean Air Act.

Researchers at Western University are advancing an alternative: solid-state sodium batteries.

Unlike lithium, sodium is abundant and widely available, making it a more accessible option for large-scale applications like electric vehicles and grid storage. The Western University team is developing a solid-state sodium battery that leverages a chemically engineered electrolyte designed for stability, safety, and improved performance.

The new electrolyte incorporates sulfur and chlorine to form a solid structure that allows sodium ions to move more freely — addressing a longstanding conductivity issue in sodium-based systems.

The researchers emphasize that solid-state configurations reduce the risk of fire while offering higher energy density potential — critical for sectors where downtime or failure isn't an option.

Advanced Tools Unlock New Understanding of Ion Transport

To validate the material's performance, the team turned to the Canadian Light Source (CLS), a synchrotron research facility at the University of Saskatchewan. Using high-intensity X-ray imaging, they were able to observe how sodium ions travel through the electrolyte at the atomic level.

This capability to map ionic movement in real time is helping researchers refine material properties faster than conventional trial-and-error methods allow. The ability to visualize conductivity mechanisms on such a fine scale not only benefits battery research but also has implications for broader fields like clean technology and advanced manufacturing.

A major challenge in solid-state battery design is compatibility between materials. Many solid electrolytes degrade when in contact with electrodes or other components. However, Western’s formulation has shown early signs of stability with common battery materials — a promising indicator for future scalability.",https://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/environment/original/20251114-105419-33e-curated-lifestyle-_GirzMqq1cY-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:01:54.098656

“It’s really fantastic to have so many like-minded, ambitious individuals working in the same area,” Hackl said.
“What we are doing is truly in line with the history of Oakland,” Hackl said, referring to the role the railroads, the port, the steel mills and warehouses played in developing Oakland.","A once dreary corner of West Oakland — where the I-880 freeway collapsed in the Loma Prieta earthquake and industry fled over the decades — is becoming a bright spot in Oakland’s economic growth.

A hub of innovative manufacturing companies, with a focus on advancing climate technology, is springing up in old factories and warehouses. The new companies focus on sustainable materials, clean energy, construction supplies and waste regeneration.

It wasn’t by chance that these startups found a home in West Oakland. Developer, Joe Ernst, committed to Oakland, has converted the industrial warehouses into turnkey R&D (research and development) spaces. He and the City worked as partners, and the changes benefit not only the new businesses, but also the residents.

“I know it doesn’t look like it when you drive around, but there’s a lot going on,” said Lukas Hackl, co-founder and CEO of Aepnus Technology, one of the new companies, located on the Prescott Campus on Peralta Street.

“You see a lot of warehouses and some of them still look empty.”

Aepnus Technology is working on converting byproducts — essentially waste — from the battery and mining industries into critical chemicals that can be reused in manufacturing processes, sometimes in the very same industries that produced the waste.

“Many of our customers spend a lot of money getting rid of their wastestreams,” Hackl said. “Using our technology, we can hand back usable chemicals.”

A few blocks away from Aepnus, Longshot Space Technologies is developing what founder and CEO Mike Grace calls “the world’s largest gun.” Rather than bullets, the long gas-pressurized tube will hopefully one day sling everything from satellites to necessities for Mars settlers into outer space — without the need for rockets or massive amounts of rocket fuel.

“It’s like a giant potato gun,” he said, referring to a toy that uses air pressure to fire projectiles.

First came the developers

Reinvestment in West Oakland began in 2021 when the developer Joe Ernst with srmERNST began redeveloping industrial warehouses into what would become the Prescott Campus. Simultaneously, the developer SKB renovated the former American Steel factory into a Class A manufacturing and research and development campus, now home to several R&D companies.

“Joe initially reached out to us about our Business Improvement District program,” said Cristy Johnston Limon, Deputy Director of Oakland’s Economic and Workforce Development Department. “That’s a resource where property owners in an area vote to assess themselves to support extra services such as graffiti abatement, beautification and community events.”

“Our division quickly became a solutions partner to address everything from identifying the owners of railroad tracks that required removal, to stewarding a variety of permits through the City’s different departments,” she said. “Joe and his team activated 18th Street with a weekly farmer’s market, and ultimately launched the Prescott Market, a bustling food hall that serves area residents and workers, while providing a great meeting spot before and after Oakland Ballers games at Raimondi Park.”

Feeding the workforce

The Prescott Market, home to seven eating and drinking establishments, “is sort of becoming the watering hole for the area,” said Hackl from Aepnus.

“It’s really fantastic to have so many like-minded, ambitious individuals working in the same area,” Hackl said. “We can bond over what we’re doing, which is not easy.”

Other food and drink options have opened in the area — the popular June’s Pizza, Brix Factory Brewing, Soba Ichi Ramen, and Sun Moon Studio, which won its first Michelin Star this year.

Across from Prescott Market, Raimondi Park was a long-neglected Oakland ballfield that’s been renovated into a small but modern stadium, after City departments worked in partnership with area stakeholders, to clear a path for this community-driven project. It’s now home to the Oakland Ballers, the minor-league team that won the Pioneer League championship this season.

What drew the startups

One factor drawing the startups is the availability of affordable real estate and infrastructure, from transportation to electrical supply and wide streets.

“Oakland has a significant industrial legacy,” said Grace, of Longshot, “and a lot of that is still here. You can get a lot of stuff shipped in and out of here pretty easily, and there are lots of old warehouses and affordable real estate. It was pretty derelict for a while, but it’s attractive now.”

Another factor making West Oakland appealing is the abundance of engineers and entrepreneurs trained at UC Berkeley and Stanford.

“The key to startups is having talent,” Grace said, “and there’s a lot of talent here in the Bay Area.”

Much of that talent was honed in post-graduate fellowship programs that aim to transform engineers and scientists into entrepreneurs, said Hackl, a graduate of UC Berkeley and the Activate Fellowship program.

“You have a lot of smart minds shifting from academia to the real world of production,” he said.

Andy Zhao, founder and chief science officer at Limelight, said the area also offers proximity to national laboratories, technology innovators and venture capitalists as well as the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley, even for companies like his that are developing and using hardware more than software.

How the city helped

Climate tech is one of several growth sectors cited in Oakland’s five-year Economic Development Action Plan, accepted by City Council in October, said Ashleigh Kanat, Director of Oakland’s EWDD.

“Oakland’s growing climate tech industry is made up of local businesses and workers focused on protecting our city and the environment,” said Kanat. “Some are finding ways to cut pollution and capture carbon from the air, while others are helping our neighborhoods and infrastructure prepare for hotter weather, rising seas and other climate impacts.”

“This work isn’t just good for the environment — it’s creating new jobs, attracting investment, and building a stronger, more resilient Oakland for the future.”

Kanat said the city staff in Business Development regularly help climate tech and other businesses navigate permitting and regulatory requirements.

“For instance, in order to meet Aepnus’ aggressive startup timeline, the City worked with the property owner to fast track permits, pulling in staff from other departments to assist. Aepnus was able to move in and begin operations to meet their investors’ benchmarks.”

Reviving manufacturing

While the surge of advanced manufacturing businesses, like Aepnus, have a modern focus, they also harken back to the past.

“What we are doing is truly in line with the history of Oakland,” Hackl said, referring to the role the railroads, the port, the steel mills and warehouses played in developing Oakland. “I feel like what we’re doing is reviving, and revising, some of that.”

Andy Zhao, of Limelight, agrees.

“The place to do something revolutionary seems like Oakland,” he said.",https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Longshot-CEO.png,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:36.942296

Clean energy groups are criticizing the Trump administration for holding up solar cell imports at customs, following solar panel maker QCells’ announcement of layoffs and furloughs at its Georgia factories earlier this month.

QCells manufactures solar panels at its two factories in Georgia but imports some components, including the solar cells that make up solar panels, from its factories abroad.

The company announced it’s cutting hours and contractor roles at its Georgia facilities due to customs delays.

Shipments have been held up at customs recently, a spokeswoman with QCells said, forcing the company to scale back production. QCells announced furloughs and reduced hours for about 1,000 employees earlier this month and laid off about 300 contractors.

Holding up solar imports at customs “is against President Trump’s stated goal of rebuilding American manufacturing,” Bentley Allan of the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University wrote in an email to WABE.

Further import woes could be coming, Allan said, thanks to the foreign entities of concern provisions in the omnibus spending bill passed earlier this year, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The law eliminates tax incentives for projects that get assistance from those foreign entities, and many solar advocates have worried that could be applied to all imports from China — a major source of solar panel components.

“A lot now hinges on how the Treasury Department issues guidance for these provisions,” Allan wrote. “If Treasury bars any and all components from China, it will severely hamper U.S. manufacturing for solar and batteries.”

Climate advocacy group Climate Power called the QCells customs delays part of a “war on clean energy.” The group has identified more than 158,000 clean energy jobs nationwide that it says have been lost or stalled due to other Trump policies, like cancelled grants and tax credits.

A QCells spokeswoman stressed that the company’s imports are eventually clearing customs, and she expects things to return to normal in the coming months. QCells also expects to import fewer solar cells once its Cartersville factory starts producing them next year.

Specifically, the bankruptcy code affords debtors the right to reject executory contracts (like PTC purchase agreements), provided rejection is in the best interest of the bankruptcy estate.
However, it is currently uncertain whether such attempts to classify PTC purchase agreements as forward and/or master netting agreements will prove successful.
At a minimum, PTC purchase agreements should include extensive representations and warranties, indemnity protections, and bankruptcy-related provisions.
Nevertheless, well-drafted bankruptcy-related protections can bolster a PTC buyer’s position (and rights to the PTCs) in the event of bankruptcy.","The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 created the ability to transfer production tax credits (“PTC”) to an “eligible taxpayer” pursuant to Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). However, exactly when an eligible taxpayer acquires a PTC is often not clear. Such uncertainty creates fertile ground for disputes, especially in bankruptcy.

PTCs arise under federal tax law, so it may be presumed that an eligible taxpayer does not acquire a PTC until the close of the applicable tax year (and then only when a return is filed). Moreover, an eligible taxpayer does not have the right to transfer a PTC until the following conditions are met: (i) registration of the PTC with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”); (ii) execution of a binding purchase agreement; (iii) generation of the PTC; (iv) filing of information pertaining to the PTC on a timely basis; and (v) filing of a transfer election statement with the eligible taxpayer’s annual return, which identifies the transferee taxpayer. See IRC, Section 6418.

Since PTCs are generated on a rolling basis as energy is produced, PTCs may be acquired from an eligible taxpayer for a single year, for multiple years into the future, or even for the life of a project. Such agreements are executory in nature (i.e., a contract for which there remains something to be done on both sides).

Furthermore, PTCs are not transferred contemporaneously with the execution of an agreement for their purchase, such transactions come with typical transactional risks that require extensive due diligence and careful purchase agreement drafting. Due to their executory nature, agreements to purchase PTCs have unique risks in the context of a bankruptcy filing by an eligible taxpayer. Specifically, the bankruptcy code affords debtors the right to reject executory contracts (like PTC purchase agreements), provided rejection is in the best interest of the bankruptcy estate. Thus, debtors/eligible taxpayers might reject purchase agreements and instead offer the subject PTCs to third parties willing to pay higher prices in order to capture greater value for the bankruptcy estate. Due to the existence of such bankruptcy-related risks, transferee taxpayers should consider incorporating provisions into purchase agreements to protect their rights in the event of bankruptcy. One option is to draft PTC purchase agreements in such a manner as to eliminate all future performance by transferee taxpayers, which would require significantly different structuring than current industry standards. With no future performance obligations, the purchase agreements would be non-executory and therefore not subject to rejection in bankruptcy.

Alternatively, parties have attempted to draft purchase agreements as forward contracts and/or master netting agreements to obtain the safe harbor protections afforded such contracts by the bankruptcy code. However, it is currently uncertain whether such attempts to classify PTC purchase agreements as forward and/or master netting agreements will prove successful.

At a minimum, PTC purchase agreements should include extensive representations and warranties, indemnity protections, and bankruptcy-related provisions. Given the extremely limited guidance offered by the courts, it is unclear whether such bankruptcy-related provisions will prove successful in the event of litigation.

The announcement follows confirmation of a $10 billion investment plan promoted last month by President Donald Trump, aimed at expanding Toyota’s domestic operations over the next five years.

Notably, Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda drew attention earlier this month at a racing event at Japan’s Fuji Speedway, reportedly wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and T-shirt featuring Trump and Vice President JD Vance. During the event, Toyoda hosted U.S. Ambassador George Glass and addressed questions about tariffs, saying he was not there to debate whether they were good or bad, but emphasized that national leaders naturally try to protect their own auto industries. He added that Toyota is seeking tariff strategies that benefit all parties, especially customers.

“The purpose of a public meeting is to provide the opportunity to submit comments or ask questions about the application,” according to TCEQ.
So far, the application has received 158 comments, 53 hearing requests, and 15 public meeting requests, according to TCEQ’s database.

The company Saronic Technologies applied to TCEQ for an air permit that would allow it to build an Autonomous Surface Vessel Manufacturing Facility located at 1312 Dalton Lane in Austin at the Eastside Commerce Center, just north of the airport, according to a TCEQ public notice.

Saronic Technologies produces three models of autonomous boats for the U.S. Navy. According to the Austin Business Journal, the facility would “enable Saronic to scale up its operations, as well as expand into new products and bring more operations in-house.”

A Saronic spokesperson shared the following statement in response to the group’s call to action:

“Saronic is dedicated to doing right by our community as we invest and grow in Austin. Our commitment includes meeting local health, safety, and environmental requirements, and working with local government and community partners to ensure our operations have a positive and responsible impact. We take our commitment to our employees, partners, and neighbors seriously.”

TCEQ’s plain language summary of the pending permit outlines what the facility will be used for and what air pollutants are expected to be emitted from it.

“This permit will authorize the production of surface vessels by use of gelcoat and resin spray application and curing, resin based adhesive use, cutting and drilling, and resin injection,” the summary says. “Saronic Technologies, Inc. has listed in its application the pollutants and amounts that will be emitted for each facility.”

According to the summary, the following Pollutant Proposed Emissions (in tons per year) are expected from the facilities:

VOCs: 50.12

HAPs: 43.85

PM: 0.001

PM2.5: 0.001

PM10: 0.001

PODER is concerned about the facility’s expected emissions, noting in a social media post that there are several child care centers, nursing homes, and hospitals within a 2-mile radius of the facility.

“Right now, it is the public comment period of the air permit, and we are in particular asking for folks to comment to ask for a public meeting,” Alexia Leclercq with PODER explained. “So essentially, when there is significant interest shown to the TCEQ that residents have concern about any facility or any permit, we’re able to get, you know, a public meeting.”

According to the TCEQ public notice on Saronic’s permit application, folks can submit public comments or request a public meeting about the permit application.

“The purpose of a public meeting is to provide the opportunity to submit comments or ask questions about the application,” according to TCEQ. “A public meeting about the application will be held if requested by an interested person and the executive director determines that there is a significant degree of public interest in the application or if requested by a local legislator. A public meeting is not a contested case hearing.”

A contested case hearing can be requested by persons who may be affected by emissions of air contaminants from the facility.

So far, the application has received 158 comments, 53 hearing requests, and 15 public meeting requests, according to TCEQ’s database. State Representative Lulu Flores was among those who submitted a public hearing request. Rep. Flores stated the following in the letter, which was addressed to TCEQ Chief Clerk Laurie Gharis:

Dear Ms. Gharis:

Several of my constituents have raised concerns to my office about the potential negative effects on the local air quality that could result from the proposed construction and operation of an autonomous surface vessel manufacturing facility in their area. The location of the facility would be 1312 Dalton Lane, Austin, TX 78742, and the operators, Saronic Technologies, Inc., have applied to TCEQ for an air quality permit. The proposed permit number is referenced above.

I understand that TCEQ has also received many public comments related to this project. To ensure that all stakeholders, including my constituents who live nearby, have an opportunity to be heard on this matter, I am requesting a public meeting regarding this application. I believe that such a meeting would be most productive if it were to take place after the draft permit became available, so I would further request that the meeting be scheduled for after that time.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Leclercq said PODER is requesting a public meeting so that residents who will be impacted by the pollutants would be able to voice their concerns and ask questions to TCEQ. She said it would also “essentially slow down the process of approval through the TCEQ and gives residents the chance to organize and really figure out what it is.”

Leclercq said PODER is concerned about the facility’s pollutants that will be created during the manufacturing of the boats, compounded with other pollutants and environmental concerns in the area.

“A lot of times, as an environmental justice org, we look at cumulative impact,” Leclercq said. “And so, for example, in that area, we already have the airport, we already have the Tank Farm. We also have the truck traffic. We have the highway expansion, and so we take a lot of that into consideration when thinking about the health of the communities in that area.”",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/11/IMG_1143.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-19 14:03:33.177248

To increase capacity of US-made solar tech by 3.7 GW, to hit total 17.7 GW in 2027.

Solar module developer

First Solar, headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, is to establish a new facility in Gaffney, Cherokee County, South Carolina. The firm says that the purpose of the new site is “to onshore final production processes for Series 6 Plus modules initiated by the company’s international fleet.”

First Solar expects to spend approximately $330 million to establish the new facility, which is scheduled to commence commercial operations in the second half of 2026. The facility is forecast to create over 600 new jobs with an average manufacturing salary of $74,000 per year, approximately twice the per capita income in Cherokee County, the firm says.

The South Carolina facility was catalyzed by demand for domestically-produced energy technology created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in July 2025.

‘American-made’

The facility is expected to increase First Solar’s capacity to produce “American-made solar technology” that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance, by 3.7 gigawatts (GW), to reach 17.7 GW of annual capacity in 2027. Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina commented, “First Solar’s investment will create 600 new jobs in Cherokee County, which will greatly strengthen the local economy and help advance America’s energy independence.”

The onshored processes will transform thin film solar cells produced by First Solar’s international fleet into fully completed modules. The new facility expands the company’s footprint in South Carolina, which currently includes a distribution center in Duncan, Spartanburg County, and a longstanding partnership with Inland Port Greer.

The Gaffney plant will be part of what the company calls “already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development footprint in the Western Hemisphere, including three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Louisiana, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California.”

Altogether, the company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” said Mark Widmar, CEO at First Solar. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the US market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the company says it expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country – “estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income”.",https://optics.org/images/favicon-16.png,N,,2025-11-19 13:02:26.407604

However, SB 100 was not just another RPS standard increase; it also required that all of California’s electricity be sourced by carbon-free resources by 2045.","Despite being an oil-rich state and ranking third in refining capacity behind Louisiana and Texas, California has surpassed even Hawaii, which imports practically everything, as the state with the highest average cost of a gallon of gas at $4.64 per gallon, and comes in third for the highest cost of electricity rates per kilowatt-hour (kWh) at $32.41 per kWh. Most of California’s problems, including and especially high energy costs, are self-imposed and make the state a prime case study of how misguided, idealistic policy can ruin even the most resource-abundant regions.

1970s, The Beginning

California’s alternative energy push dates back to the 1970s. This decade was wrought with multiple conflicts in the Middle East, including the Yom Kippur War of 1973, the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973-1974, and the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979. In particular, the Arab Oil Embargo put significant pressure on American consumers due to America’s heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. The supply shortages brought on by the embargo and the accompanying price controls occurred only a few years after the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969, which, despite the majority of the cleanup being completed in 45 days, had soured public opinion of oil operations in California. This event spurred the beginnings of the environmental movement in California, and the compounded supply shortages caused by the Arab embargo pushed legislators even further toward forcing energy alternatives, leading directly to the creation of the California Energy Commission (CEC).

The Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources and Conservation Act of 1974, signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan, established the CEC, which began operations in 1975. Born out of the chaos of the oil supply chain challenges, the CEC was tasked with “reducing energy costs, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions, and ensuring a safe, resilient, and reliable supply of energy.” Ironically, the most reliable source of energy, both then and now, in California, is conventional fuels, specifically, the plentiful in-state oil and natural gas reserves, which continue to be politically vilified and sidelined by renewable energy.

The end of the decade saw the implementation of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, which has faced both praise and criticism. PURPA is federal legislation that was implemented — once again, out of concern for oil supply chain challenges from foreign sources in the Middle East — to encourage the development of renewable energy, reduce reliance on conventional fuels, and promote energy diversity. Instead of encouraging a solution developed through free-market competition to demonstrate the potential of renewable energy to both surpass and replace conventional fuels fully, the government initiative has turned into decades of subsidization in the form of tax credits and mandatory purchase rates from qualifying facilities (QFs) — defined by law as either a small power producer or cogenerator (their primary energy source must be renewable).

Supporters argue that it helped create the opportunity for developing renewable energy at scale and established and expanded the foundation for energy security. However, because of subsidization, interconnection challenges, and regulatory favoritism, PURPA encouraged rent-seeking rather than profit-seeking. Over time, renewable energy providers are now established enough, through government subsidization, to compete without mandatory purchase obligations. In 2020, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) took a step to address the new market reality and the concerns from utility providers by giving states a greater level of flexibility in how they implement the law, with a particular focus on setting the mandatory purchase rates. These changes, while welcomed by critics of PURPA, led many renewable energy groups to protest, arguing that it would hinder their ability to develop further, highlighting the question of whether or not renewable energy could survive and grow without government subsidies and mandates.

2000s to Today

In 2002, California enacted SB 1078, officially creating the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which set an initial requirement that, by 2017, 20% of all retail electricity sales be serviced by renewable energy sources. This legislation was instrumental in laying the groundwork for both the future expansion of the RPS as well as other green mandate initiatives. For example, as part of the renewable energy push, the California Solar Initiative was launched in 2006 as part of SB 1, providing financial subsidies for the installation of solar panels, especially in residential areas. This government manipulation of the market led to a massive increase in solar capacity, but came with a high cost and posed an unfair financial burden to non-solar users who were not able to afford them. Additionally, the following year, Assembly Bill 118, 2007, created the Clean Transportation Program, formerly the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program, as a means to fund the creation and market introduction of alternative fuels, other than gasoline, and electric vehicles (EVs). Assembly Bill 118 artificially created more support for renewable energy by promoting the electrification of transportation and by directly funding projects such as the California Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Project (CALeVIP), which sought to, but has ultimately failed, to create an interconnected network of EV charging stations to compete directly with the scale of gas stations.

In 2015, California continued its green energy crusade with the passage of Assembly Bill 802, which ultimately allowed utilities to offer monetary incentives for implementing what was argued to be energy efficiency improvements. The general goal was to further the transition to renewables, and its implementation reduced energy demand and enabled a higher proportion of the remaining electricity demand to come from renewables; such a reduction also inevitably reduces economic growth, and was another clear example of government interference and market manipulation. 2015 also saw the passage of SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act, which established new renewable energy goals and even more aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets. SB 350 also increased the RPS requirement to 50% by 2030, and it was later increased to 60% in 2018 with the passage of SB 100, with 2030 still being the target year. However, SB 100 was not just another RPS standard increase; it also required that all of California’s electricity be sourced by carbon-free resources by 2045. The objective of California’s RPS is a classic example of government market intervention and, therefore, manipulation. By requiring a certain percentage of electricity to be sourced from renewables, Sacramento has taken away a significant amount of choice from Californians.

In 2006, during the passage and periodic expansion of RPS, Sacramento passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act, AB 32, which required that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions return to the levels of the 1990s no later than 2020 — this would have been a 15% decrease from the early 2000s levels. AB 32 was a prime example of government market manipulation, given how the legislation gave blatant preferential treatment to companies focused on renewable energy, even though they, too, were and are guilty of carbon emissions. Furthermore, the outcome of this piece of legislation, and those of a similar nature, inevitably resulted in higher costs for utility companies, which were passed down to the consumer in the form of higher prices. For this reason, in 2010, Proposition 23 was introduced in order to suspend the implementation of AB 32 until unemployment in the state was consistently below 5.5% for four quarters. Many of California’s energy policies follow a trend of focusing on lowering GHG, supported by the argument that adopting an entirely renewable energy economy would be the way to achieve the goal of both lowering GHG and fighting climate change. This rhetoric has led to the current self-inflicted energy crisis in California.

Since 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom has supported and signed into law numerous pieces of legislation that have taken the renewable push and forced displacement of conventional fuels even further. In 2020, Newsom signed an executive order that all new vehicle sales in the state were to be zero-carbon emission by 2035. By doing so, Newsom effectively eliminated all market choice for automobiles in California, allowing only EVs based on a flawed understanding of emissions; if EVs were a perfect or superior alternative to internal combustion engines, then the market would respond differently. Furthermore, what was clearly not taken into account in these directives was that California lacks the critical infrastructure and grid capacity to sustain an entirely electric vehicle consumer base.

The only way to expand EV capacity has been through market manipulation and government subsidization, both of which have severely increased the cost of living in California. Fortunately, much of these EV mandates were reversed on June 12th, 2025, when President Trump signed a series of resolutions that ended California’s plans to mandate that all new vehicles in the state sold beginning in 2035 be net-zero, rolled back Sacramento’s low-nitrogen oxide regulations for heavy duty-trucks, and rescinded the 2023 EPA waiver that at the time President Biden supported, allowing for California to enforce even stricter vehicle emissions standards then required.

Conclusion

Since the 1970s, California has incrementally expanded its mandate for renewable energy while ousting conventional fuels through both political rhetoric and unfavorable policies. By doing so, California has manipulated the market to favor renewable energy, causing prices to slowly rise over time to the point where the state now boasts some of the highest electricity and gas prices in the country. California’s history of progressive legislation favoring renewable energy is a clear example of the risks of government market intervention in determining winners and losers in business. Had renewable energy been required to compete on equal terms with conventional fuels, the free market would have responded accordingly, with either outright rejection or specific feedback on the innovations needed to make the technology viable for consumers. Instead, Californians are left with high prices and a lack of true free market choice, which, given the state’s vast resources and potential for increased pipeline infrastructure, could have made oil and gas both more accessible and affordable for consumers. Californians deserve to have more choice in their energy consumption, but unfortunately, it may have to get worse before it gets better.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bigstock-Solar-Panels-On-A-Background-O-346787059.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 21:59:49.599708

The 68-year old joins a crowded field of candidates seeking to replace Gavin Newsom, and in a statement released this week pledged to focus on the state’s intractable affordability crisis.

“Californians deserve a life they can afford. But the Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. We need to get back to basics. And that means making corporations pay their fair share again,” Steyer said.

With Newsom termed out from running, several prominent Democrats have entered the race, including former congresswoman Katie Porter; Xavier Becerra, a former US cabinet member; Antonio Villaraigosa, a former state lawmaker who served as the LA mayor; and Betty Yee, who was the state controller from 2015 to 2023. Congressman Eric Swalwell is expected to announce plans to run.

Porter was considered the frontrunner until October when video emerged of her appearing frustrated with a journalist during an interview with a local news outlet and threatening to walk out. In the aftermath of the incident, Republican Chad Bianco, the Riverside county sheriff who is running for governor, took the lead in polling. Steve Hilton, a former David Cameron adviser and Fox News host, is also running as a Republican.

Steyer is perhaps best known as one of the largest donors to the Democratic party and his 2020 campaign for president. The former hedge fund manager created NextGen America, a political action committee and non-profit, spending millions to mobilize voters on the climate crisis and reproductive rights, among other issues. He dropped out from the 2020 race after the South Carolina primary, where he came in behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

But he has remained an active supporter of Democratic causes. Steyer spent more than $12m in support of California’s recently passed redistricting measure.

In a statement announcing his plans to run, Steyer said he led “winning campaigns” for state legislation that raised the tobacco tax to support healthcare programs and a proposition that “closed a corporate tax loophole for out-of-state companies”.

“I wanted to build a business here. Now, it’s worth billions of dollars. And I walked away from it because I wanted to give back to California,” Steyer said. “I’ve taken on out-of-state corporations that refused to pay their California taxes. I’ve taken on the oil companies. I’ve taken on the tobacco companies. We’ve raised billions of dollars for California citizens, without charging California citizens a nickel.”

Steyer said that as governor he would lower utility costs, build 1m homes in four years, make pre-school and community college free and ban corporate Pac money in state elections.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ecd3238b3c5f4843433256deaa22ff4f3c9a276/378_0_3781_3025/master/3781.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad6d20dec731e9445d4562a3189a2707",N,,2025-11-19 15:02:24.740097

WASHINGTON, Nov 18 (Reuters) – The CEOs of the Detroit Three automakers and a senior Tesla executive have been invited to appear at a Jan. 14 Senate hearing on the impact of auto regulations and vehicle prices, Reuters has learned.

General Motors GM.N CEO Mary Barra, Ford F.N CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis STLAM.MI CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla TSLA.O Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

“This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,” Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

Cruz led efforts in Congress this summer to win approval for a provision in a tax and budget bill to eliminate penalties for automakers not meeting U.S. fuel economy standards dating back to 2022. The legislation also eliminates up to $10,000 in interest on new car loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles for most buyers.

It’s a Faustian Bargain: Nuclear power for a moment, and radioactive waste forever.""","The U.S. Department of Energy has granted Constellation Energy a $1 billion loan to help finance the restart of the undamaged reactor at Three Mile Island.

Constellation is moving forward with restarting the reactor formerly known as unit 1 - Constellation rechristened it the Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center - after reaching an agreement in September 2024 to sell the energy produced by the plant to Microsoft for 20 years. The company, the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the country, hopes to have the 835-megawatt reactor on line in 2027.

Microsoft reached the deal to offset its energy needs to power its data centers in the mid-Atlantic region. The reactor can produce enough energy to power 800,000 homes.

When Constellation announced its intentions to restart unit 1, company president and CEO Joe Dominguez said tax incentives and other government guarantees would be necessary to complete the $1.6 billion project, which includes restoring the reactor, its turbine, generator and other systems. The reactor, which Constellation purchased in 1999, has been closed down since Sept. 20, 2019, with the company reporting that it had no longer become economically viable. The Microsoft deal, coupled with federal clean energy tax breaks and loans, made reopening the plant economically feasible, the company said.

Chris Rodgers, senior manager for generation communications for Constellation, said the Microsoft deal was the catalyst of the decision to restart the reactor, which he said was closed prematurely. Nuclear power has had a renaissance , spurred by increasing demands for electricity, making nuclear energy more economically viable. Once operational, Rodgers said, unit 1's power would bolster the grid's reliability and put ""downward pressure on prices.""

This is not the only time unit 1 was idle for a lengthy period or time. It was closed for refueling when a combination of malfunctions and human error caused a partial meltdown of TMI's unit 2 reactor, the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. It reopened in 1985 after a lengthy regulatory review and legal battles fought by organizations seeking to keep it closed. Unit 2 is being decommissioned by its owner, Energy Solutions.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright was quoted in a news release as saying, ""Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region. It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

The energy department also viewed Constellation as a good credit risk. The company is valued at $106 billion and Rodgers said the company's ""entire balance sheet is behind this loan."" The company has pledged to pay back the loan, with interest.

Anti-nuclear activists, though, believe the deal exposes a flaw in relying on nuclear power.

""Nuclear power is an economic fiction that only functions through government bailouts,"" said Eric Epstein, who has run TMI Alert since shortly after the 1979 accident. ""Three Mile Island will have one client: Microsoft. This marriage between Microsoft and a zombie nuclear plant is exclusive, and benefits Microsoft’s facilities in Illinois, Virginia and Ohio. How does exporting TMI-1’s energy to another zip code keep the lights on in Pennsylvania?

The Environmental Protection Agency will proceed with tightened nitrogen-oxide emissions limits for heavy-duty trucks for the 2027 model year but is open to adjusting certain requirements, American Trucking Associations recently said in a communication to its members.

“We are encouraged by several proposed adjustments that should help lower costs and ease implementation,” ATA Vice President of Energy and Environmental Affairs Patrick Kelly said in a Nov. 17 message to federation membership obtained by Transport Topics, noting that the agency had informed ATA it “does not plan to meet” the federation’s request for a four-year delay of the rules.

In August, ATA asked EPA to delay the rule due to the potential for “substantial compliance costs and operational burdens at a time when the trucking industry is already contending with historically difficult market conditions.”

Kelly said that while EPA “does not plan to meet our full request,” he noted its planned rulemaking is “likely to eliminate the extended warranty periods set to take effect in 2027 and instead retain the existing warranty requirements, while also revising useful life standards and making other technical changes to the rule.” He stated that changes to the rule’s 0.035 g/hp-hr standard or an extension of the 2027 implementation date “will be outside the scope” of EPA action.

That said, Kelly in a message supplied to TT said ATA is appreciative of any EPA and Trump administration efforts that would aim to “reevaluate heavy-duty engine and vehicle standards to reduce unnecessary costs to new trucks. This action will help preserve trucking jobs and keep freight moving safely and efficiently.”

Kelly noted that heavy-duty truck emissions have been reduced by 99% since 1970 but stressed that “further reducing NOx by over 80% requires costly new emissions control equipment that remains untested in the marketplace.”

He also repeated ATA’s concerns about timing of the rule’s adoption.

“The underlying 2027 implementation timeline raises serious concerns for America’s truckers, as the rule is likely to drive up equipment prices at a time when the nation’s motor carriers are already bracing for steep increases,” he said.

EPA is expected to publish the updated rule in the Federal Register around March or April 2026 and make it available for public comment. EPA did not immediately respond to TT’s request for comment.

Earlier this year, the agency announced a review of a long list of earlier regulations, including its Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles rules and its Heavy-Duty [nitrogen oxides] rule. The agency had called “problematic” regulations adopted by previous administrations that it argued “results in significant costs that will make the products our trucks deliver, like food and other household goods, more expensive.”

Excise Tax on the Table

Kelly stressed that ATA will “work with EPA staff to ensure opportunities to further reduce costs are maximized.”

A key and ongoing priority for the federation’s efforts on Capitol Hill and with the Trump administration is a repeal of the federal excise tax on new trucks.

Kelly stressed that the “new pain points” threatened by the upcoming EPA rule “are compounded by the punitive, century-old federal excise tax on trucks — a tax that adds thousands of dollars to the cost of every new vehicle.”

In March, a bill that would repeal the World War I-era tax was introduced in the House of Representatives. Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), a senior member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, reintroduced legislation he proposed during previous sessions of Congress. The bill would cancel the 12% federal tax, which is applied to certain commercial vehicles.

“For over a century, the federal excise tax on heavy-duty trucks has gone from a temporary wartime measure to fund World War I to an outdated tax that punishes truck buyers,” LaMalfa said. “This is the highest percentage-based tax Congress imposes on any product. This tax forces buyers to stick with older, less efficient models and makes it harder for truckers to modernize their rigs, holding back the trucking industry from updating.”

ATA was among those that praised the legislation.

Based on company research, the U.S. must add more than 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity within the coming decade to meet rising demand from AI, electrification and industrial growth

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Schneider Electric, a global energy technology leader, opened the company's Innovation Summit North America 2025 today, convening more than 2,500 business leaders and market innovators representing nearly every industry to accelerate solutions for a more resilient, affordable and intelligent energy future. The two-day summit (November 18–19) features technology showcases, partner announcements and new research designed to help organizations build ahead of demand and unlock new productivity with AI, software and services.

In his keynote address, Schneider Electric CEO Olivier Blum spoke to the evolving energy landscape, highlighting the company's continuing transformation to meet industry demands. He presented a forward-looking vision that further establishes the company's position as an energy technology partner.

Schneider Electric is advancing energy technology, the integration of electrification, automation and digital intelligence, across buildings, data centers, industrial applications and power grids. The company's open, AI-powered EcoStruxure™ Platform creates intelligent ecosystems to drive real-time insights, resilience, and efficiency.

""By converging electrification, automation and digitalization, we unlock the full value of energy, creating efficiency and sustainability for all,"" said Olivier Blum, CEO, Schneider Electric. ""As your dedicated energy technology partner, our role is to translate that vision into concrete solutions that help you rapidly digitalize and strengthen your resilience. Innovation Summit North America is where we bring this to life, moving faster from ambition to action, advancing Energy Tech together with our entire ecosystem of partners and customers.""

North America is entering a new growth cycle driven by AI workloads, re-industrialization and transport electrification. Much of today's infrastructure was not built to handle fast-ramping, highly variable demand, creating a gap between when capacity is needed and when it comes online. According to Schneider Electric's Sustainability Research Institute, grid instability costs U.S. businesses billions annually. The nation must add 1,000–2,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per decade to meet demand from AI computing, manufacturing and electrification (one TWh powers about 90,000 homes for a year). Schneider Electric's call at Innovation Summit North America is for public and private partnerships to address the time to power gap by adding capacity closer to where it's consumed; using software and AI to unlock headroom, reliability and efficiency from existing systems; and modernizing grid operations so energy can be orchestrated at scale.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

Cruz led efforts in Congress this summer to win approval for a provision in a tax and budget bill to eliminate penalties for automakers not meeting US fuel economy standards dating back to 2022. The legislation also eliminates up to $10,000 in interest on new car loans for US-assembled vehicles for most buyers.

The Trump administration has taken aim at vehicle environmental rules on a number of fronts. In June, Trump signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 and two other vehicle rules.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said last week the administration will soon propose rolling back NHTSA fuel economy rules from the 2022 through 2031 model years.

Reeder, a former Deputy Chief of Staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to pay $21,773.95 to resolve allegations that he violated federal conflict-of-interest laws prior to his retirement from the agency in 2019.

Among other things, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 prohibits executive branch employees from participating personally and substantially in particular matters that will affect their own financial interests or the financial interests of certain parties with whom they have ties outside the government, including any organization with whom they are negotiating prospective employment. The United States alleges that while serving on a two-year detail to a local university under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act agreement, Reeder impermissibly negotiated for employment with the university. Before and during the detail, the agency warned Reeder that he remained subject to federal ethics laws and that negotiating for employment with the university would create a prohibited financial conflict of interest. Despite these warnings, Reeder actively engaged in negotiations for a teaching position and extended his detail to finalize the university’s employment offer. Reeder failed to immediately disclose his negotiations to the agency as required and later filed a notification form with the agency’s ethics office that misrepresented the timing of his negotiations.

“The EPA Office of Inspector General takes allegations of conflicts of interest seriously and will thoroughly investigate potential misconduct,” said Acting EPA Inspector General Nicole Murley. “American taxpayers have the right to expect the highest standards of ethical behavior from federal officials. Any conflict of interest undermines that trust, and we are committed to upholding integrity and accountability at the EPA.”

At a recent UN Security Council meeting on climate and security, U.S. representative Dan Negrea criticized China over its carbon emissions, disregarding China's large population and development needs.

Geng Shuang, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, responded to the allegations, saying that China, with a population of 1.4 billion and the second-largest GDP in the world, ""is contributing annually more than 30 percent to the world economic growth, and its per capita emission is not among the highest in the world.""

Geng critiqued the U.S. for undermining global efforts by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement twice and urged collaboration instead of blaming others.

In recent years, the U.S., the country with the biggest historical responsibility for the current climate warming, has dithered on its climate policy and reversed many significant decisions.

This year, under the Donald Trump administration, Washington withdrew from the Paris Agreement -- for the second time -- and issued multiple executive orders to lift restrictions on domestic coal development while expanding oil and gas production.

An analysis led by researchers from Princeton University suggests that this reversal of climate policies will cause the U.S. to emit an additional 470 million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually over the next decade.

On the issue of climate, the U.S. has not only let the world down by refusing to shoulder its share of the responsibilities but also deliberately obstructed the efforts of others.

According to Politico, the U.S. government is leveraging its trade influence to coerce the EU, Japan and others into purchasing American oil and natural gas. It is also deliberately deploying diplomatic tools to prevent other countries from reducing the use of fossil fuels.

During the International Maritime Organization meeting in October, the U.S. delayed the implementation of a proposed global carbon tax on shipping by threatening and pressuring the negotiators from other countries.

According to a commentary in npj Climate Action, an open-access journal published by Nature, U.S. climate actions not only undermine decades of progress in transitioning to clean energy but also pose a direct threat to the global community’s ability to limit global warming to 1.5–2 °C.

The commentary, published in July, was authored by Carlos Garcia-Soto, a senior researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.

Unlike the U.S., China is firmly advancing the transition to renewable energy and improving climate governance. It is also exporting clean energy technologies and products and leading the global decarbonization process.

According to the global energy think tank Ember, China is the world’s largest investor in clean energy, with an investment of $625 billion in 2024, accounting for 31 percent of the world’s total.

In 2024, clean energy accounted for 84 percent of China’s electricity growth, and clean energy generation in the first half of this year increased by 27 percent year on year.

From 2022 to 2024, China’s installed capacity of wind and solar power surged from 635GW to 1,408GW. In 2025, the total installed capacity of China’s wind and solar power will surpass coal power.

According to a study by the Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel, China is vital especially for renewable energy products, manufacturing 92 percent of the world’s solar modules and 82 percent of wind turbines as of 2024. China’s production of green energy technologies not only meets its own rapid renewable energy installation needs but is also expected to meet the production capacity required for global decarbonization.

In July, the UK-based Carbon Brief website reported that China’s exports of solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and wind turbines in 2024 will prevent an estimated 220MtCO2 annually when put into operation overseas.

In sub-Saharan Africa, China’s clean-energy exports in 2024 alone are set to cut annual emissions by around three percent per year, and by around 4.5 percent in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Responding to the climate crisis is a global consensus, and developing clean energy represents the trend of the times. The international community can clearly see who is taking responsible action and who is shifting responsibility, who is seeking cooperation and who is making trouble on the issue of climate change.

The battery-electric horseless carriage is a vehicle that hearkens back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Mayor Eric Adams threw his support behind animal-rights activists who want to retire the horses and help carriage drivers transition to electric alternatives.

[Update November 19th: NYC’s proposed horse-drawn carriage ban fails in City Council committee hearing.]

A bill before the New York City Council would have wound down the horse-drawn cab industry by prohibiting the issuance of new licenses for such operations, which are sometimes referred to incorrectly as hansom cabs. (A hansom cab is a horse-drawn, two-wheeled carriage with a distinctive high-backed seat for the driver located at the rear, allowing passengers to sit in a low, two-seat compartment entered from the front.)

This bill would require humane removal of carriage horses, prohibiting their sale or transfer for the purposes of slaughter or use with another horse-drawn carriage.

Currently, there are approximately 1,024 electric yellow cabs in the city, representing about 7% of the total New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission medallions—a figure that hovers around 13,942. Various sources show that there were approximately 800 electric yellow cabs before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, or around 6.5% of the total. That’s far from the percentage of electric taxis the industry had 125 years ago, which was 90% of the total.

The first electric taxis were introduced in the Big Apple in 1897 and by 1900, nine out of 10 taxis were operating on battery power. The technology was not quite ready for widespread deployment and operation, however, and two events led to a resurgence in the use of horse-drawn carriages and internal-combustion engine (ICE) powered taxis became the standard.

One event with immediate effect was a major fire in 1907 that destroyed part of the fleet of the Electric Carriage and Wagon Company, a New York-based electric taxi service that operated the largest electric taxi fleet in the city, leading to its collapse.

The second was the Panic of 1907, also known as the Bankers’ Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis, a three-week-long financial crisis that took place in the US in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange suddenly fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year.

Meanwhile, what remained of the electric-taxi industry in New York City lost ground to gasoline-powered taxis. Harry N. Allen famously ordered 65 gas-powered automobiles from France, painted them red and green, and the New York Taxicab Company—which charged passengers based on metered fares—was born. Allen took this action after having to pay a five-dollar (equivalent to $171 in 2024) fare for a quarter of a mile ride in a hansom cab. He painted his fleet yellow a year or so after starting the business to improve visibility, setting a color standard that has endured through the years.

Tourists in coming years might find themselves taking leisurely rides through the park in a horseless carriage, according to industry experts.

“While horse-drawn carriages have long been an iconic fixture of Central Park, they are increasingly incompatible with the conditions of a modern, heavily-used urban green space,” Mayor Adams said. “It has become abundantly clear that these horse-drawn carriages no longer work for our city.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_273233016.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:01:31.801530

READ: Left-Leaning Think Tank Shows Working Families Tax Cuts Make Tax Code More Progressive","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The working families tax cuts provides the largest benefit to middle-income Americans, finds a study from the Tax Foundation. The middle 60 percent of earners will see the largest changes in after-tax income for 2025 and 2026, while the top 20 percent will pay a greater share of the income tax burden.

“The working families tax cuts prioritize the working men and women who keep this country running and thriving. For years, families were crushed by the high cost of living created by the failed economic policies of the Biden Administration which rewarded the wealthy and well-connected. Republican policies are tailor-made to put more money back in the pockets of working families – including, a larger Child Tax Credit, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, as well as more help with child care, health care, and education expenses” said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08). “Just like we did with the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans took more of the tax burden off the shoulders of hard-working Americans. Republicans are truly the party of the working class, waitresses, welders, seniors, and parents.”

Study Highlights

Top 20 percent pay more of the tax burden: The top 20 percent of earners will pay an increased share of all federal income taxes in 2026, just like they did after the 2017 tax law.

Working families tax cuts give the most to the middle: After-tax income increases the most for the middle 60 percent of income earners in 2025 and 2026.

Second time Republicans made the tax code fairer: The 2017 Trump tax cuts made the tax code more progressive. The working families tax cut made those tax cuts permanent.

Economic growth helps all Americans: Economic growth sparked by pro-growth tax policy in the working families tax cuts boosts incomes for all levels.

After-tax income rises for all Americans: After-tax income increases for all income levels for an average of 2.9 percent and 5.4 percent in 2025 and 2026, respectively. A separate Tax Foundation study found that Democrats’ signature tax law, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, had the opposite effect and shrank incomes for every income level in the long-run.

Other distributional analyses of tax relief enacted by Republicans have produced similar conclusions: working families tax cuts favor middle-income earners. A left-leaning think tank found that the top 1 percent of earners will pay a higher share of federal income taxes while the lowest 20 percent of earners will get the largest reduction in taxes of any income group.

Dive Brief:

Toyota Motor is investing $912 million over the next five years in its U.S. manufacturing operations to boost hybrid vehicle production, the company announced in a Nov. 18 press release.

The investments will add over 250 new jobs and be distributed among five of the automaker’s U.S. plants in Georgetown, Kentucky; Blue Springs, Mississippi; Buffalo, West Virginia; Jackson, Tennessee; and Troy, Missouri.

The investments are part of a larger $10 billion commitment that Toyota announced on Nov. 13 to increase vehicle manufacturing in the United States. It also includes ramping up domestic production of lithium-ion batteries for its electrified vehicles.

Dive Insight:

Hybrid vehicles, which are more affordable for consumers and more profitable for automakers to produce compared to fully electric vehicles, continue to serve as a bridge for Toyota and other automakers while they pursue their more long-term electrification goals.

Honda Motor Co., for example, announced in May that it is reducing its investments in electric vehicles by $20.7 billion in order to focus on launching new hybrid models. The automaker believes that its next-generation hybrid models will be integral in its long-term transition to EVs.

Toyota said its $10 billion commitment in U.S. manufacturing is part of its “best-company-in-town” multi-pathway strategy of investing locally and producing a mix of vehicles tailored to the needs of regional markets. But Toyota continues to grow its hybrid vehicle sales as demand for these models increases.

The company sold over 1 million electrified vehicles in 2024, the highest in company history. During its earnings call earlier this month, Toyota reported that sales of electrified vehicles, including hybrids, accounted for 46.9% of its global retail sales volume in the first half of FY2025, driven primarily by strong hybrid-electric (HEV) demand in North America.

The largest investment among Toyota’s five U.S. plants ($453 million) will be in Buffalo to increase output of 4-cylinder engines for hybrid vehicles, as well as the automaker’s sixth-generation hybrid transaxles and rear motor stators. Production is slated to begin in 2027. The plant currently assembles more than 1 million engines, transmissions and hybrid transaxles a year, according to Toyota.

“We are proud to see Toyota continue to grow in the Mountain State as they build world-class technology and drive the future of American manufacturing,” West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement.

A $204.4 million investment is also being made in Toyota’s Georgetown plant to install new machinery to produce 4-cylinder engines for hybrid vehicles, beginning in 2027. The Georgetown plant is Toyota’s largest global production facility and has the capacity to manufacture up to 700,000 units annually, per the release.

“I commend Toyota for their strong commitment to American workers through their new, $912 million investment in the United States, including $204.4 million for the Georgetown plant right in the heart of Kentucky,” said U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., in a statement. “Toyota’s expansion across the country will create hundreds of good-paying jobs, strengthen America’s manufacturing base, and drive economic growth in our communities.”

A $71.4 million investment in Toyota’s casting plant in Jackson will be used to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases, housings and engine blocks for hybrid vehicles. The automaker will also invest $57.1 million in its Troy casting plant to manufacture engine cylinder heads for hybrid vehicles beginning in 2027.

Chinese models dominate overall EV and PHEV sales, though, as they expand into Europe and South America.

The Geely Genome Xingyuan is a burgeoning rival to the BYD Seagull.

Tesla’s electric vehicle market share in the U.S. nearly halved in the third quarter of this year (32%) from its peak (62.8%) in 2020. But despite the tumult at the company amid its pivot to robotics and AI, its two mass-market EVs are still global favorites.

The world’s top two best-selling EVs in the first nine months of 2025 were still the Tesla Model Y and Model 3, market research firm Autovista24 said in a new report citing EV Volumes data. The other eight in the top ten best-selling EVs list were all Chinese models. The country’s plug-in hybrids are in a different league, with no Western model making the top ten PHEV list.

""Tesla controlled the top two positions in the global BEV market nine months into 2025. The Model Y accounted for an unchallenged 8.3% of all-electric car sales,"" the report said.

From January to September 2025, Tesla sold 808,173 Model Ys globally. A whopping 145,000 units were sold in September alone, likely supercharged by a massive uptake in the U.S. due to the end of the $7,500 federal credit at the end of that month. In terms of global EV sales, no other model even came close, which just shows how much the electric crossover still dominates sales charts in its fifth year on sale.

The Model 3 ranked at a distant second with 369,756 sales worldwide, followed closely by the Geely Geome Xingyuan with 343,514 units sold. The Geome Xingyuan is a compact electric hatchback sold in China, which starts at just $9,260 (68,800 yuan), and is a burgeoning rival to the popular BYD Seagull—also called Dolphin Surf in some markets—which ranked fourth with 292,579 units sold. The Wuling Mini electric city car rounded out the top five.

The fact that eight of the world’s top ten best-selling EVs are Chinese—even though the Teslas still rank at the top—may be a wake-up call for the American company. Passenger vehicles, not humanoid robots or robotaxis, are still the company's bread and butter. Moreover, in the U.S., EV sales are hitting a major reset after the end of the tax credits and the rollback of the fuel economy rules. This is a big problem for other American, European, Japanese and Korean car companies, too, as none of them are even on the top-ten list at this point, and selling EVs just got harder in their biggest market.

Another segment where Chinese automakers have comfortably consolidated their dominance is plug-in hybrids. All top ten PHEVs sold globally so far this year have been Chinese models, with no Western model even making the list. The BYD Song Plus crossover—also called Seal U in some markets—amassed 262,445 sales globally between January and September this year. The BYD Qin Plus, Song Pro, Seal 6 and Li Auto L6 round out the world’s top five best-selling PHEVs.

And even though a single BYD model isn’t selling as well as the Tesla Model Y, the company is comfortably ahead in terms of combined sales across its portfolio, accounting for 19.3% of the global EV market share, which also includes PHEVs and extended-range models. Tesla ranked a distant second with its diminishing 8% market share, followed by Geely (5.6%), Wuling (3.8%) and Volkswagen (2.8%).

While the Model Y might continue to hang on to its lead this year, the Model 3’s second-place finish at the end of the year is all but certain. The Xiaomi SU7 has been on sale for just over one year, but is already one of the world’s top-selling models. Geely also launched an updated model of the Geome in October in China with snazzier styling, more features and more trims on offer.

Unless Tesla achieves a breakthrough in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology that would prompt more buyers to purchase its cars, or surprises us with a new model to take on these Chinese EVs, its lead may continue shrinking in the coming months.

On today’s episode of Inside Automotive, Urban Science’s Global Lead for Advanced Analytics, Tom Kondrat, shares market insights and what dealers should be aware of as the new year approaches.

It has been a rollercoaster year for electric vehicles. Leading up to the sunset of the federal tax incentive, EV sales increased by 30%, achieving a 12% market share.

Sign up for CBT News’ daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox.

Now that the incentives have expired, battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales dropped 45% in October, and market share shrank to 5%. According to Kondrat, these results are not unexpected given the heavy pull-ahead purchasing earlier in the year.

BEV demand also varies significantly by geography. In the Midwest, demand remains softer, leaving many dealers with inventory on their lots. In Florida and California markets, the conversation is much different.

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have consistently accounted for roughly 2% of the industry’s market share, a small fraction of overall sales. This segment fell about 50% in October following the expiration of the federal tax credit. Hybrids, however, were up 15%. Since hybrids were not included in the federal rebate, their performance gives a more transparent snapshot of natural consumer demand.

The typical EV buyer tends to be carbon footprint-conscious and prefers smaller or mid-sized vehicles. As a result, larger all-electric SUVs and pickups have struggled to gain traction with mainstream buyers. Vehicles such as the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E align more closely with the profile of prospective EV customers and have seen greater sales success.

Many industry professionals believe that without federal incentives, Tesla is positioned to emerge as the strongest performer. Tesla recorded its best sales month in August and maintained strong performance in September, giving the automaker a stronger head start over the competition.

Kondrat also points to a regulatory topic that remains underdiscussed but has significant implications for the industry. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules shaped manufacturers’ long-term strategies, and they invested substantial capital to comply with the standards. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, manufacturers will no longer face a financial penalty for noncompliance.

Vehicle affordability remains a pressing concern. Despite the average transaction price of a new vehicle exceeding $50,000, consumer demand remains strong. Urban Science found that many shoppers continue to upgrade to larger vehicles. However, October brought a notable shift. Luxury sales declined 11%, compared with the broader retail industry’s 6.5% drop, signaling potential weakness at the upper end of the market.

""Whenever you have sales spikes, you usually have some secondary effect, and that's what we're seeing. But the state of the industry is strong and we'll continue to hum along.""

Despite the year’s challenges, the industry remains up 4% year-over-year and is on track to close out 2025 ahead of last year’s results.

Since the announcement of auto tariffs, the number of vehicles sold that are final-assembled in the United States has increased. In October, U.S.-assembled vehicle sales rose 16% year-over-year. Sales of European and Asian-assembled vehicles declined 16%. Canadian and Mexican-assembled vehicle sales increased modestly by 3%. Kodrat says this shift is primarily driven by decades of foreign investment in U.S. manufacturing capacity.

Looking ahead, Urban Science forecasts that the fourth quarter will close down 5%. While it may appear pessimistic, Q4 2024 delivered a powerful 16.5 million SAAR. A 5% decline keeps the industry in the 15 to 16 million range, which reflects solid performance. Full-year results are expected to land slightly above 16 million units.

Urban Science predicts the first quarter of 2026 will align with historical norms. Analysts are watching closely for a rebound in BEV sales as consumers who did not purchase early return to the market. While some expect that rebound to begin in early 2026, Kondrat believes it’s more likely to occur in the spring, when BEVS sales typically strengthen.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11.19.25TomKondrat-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:54.548921

It fuels businesses, supports families, and gives communities the foundation to grow.

Nowhere is that clearer than in South Carolina, where record population growth and major industrial expansion are pushing electricity demand to unprecedented levels.

Yet many projects that could expand supply and strengthen the grid are stuck waiting on approvals that take years to complete.

These delays stem largely from federal reviews that move far slower than the needs of fast-growing states like South Carolina.

The longer they wait, the higher costs climb for everyone.

The issue is not a lack of investment or ingenuity. South Carolina has become a national magnet for advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle production, aerospace suppliers, and next-generation logistics.

BMW’s continued growth in Spartanburg, Bosch’s battery component expansion, new industrial parks in Greer, Gaffney, and Laurens County, and a wave of suppliers serving Siemens and GE Vernova all depend on a modern, reliable grid.

But the bureaucratic process that governs the infrastructure needed to power these projects, transmission lines, substation upgrades, and grid interconnections moves too slowly and has become overly complex.

Developers often face overlapping reviews, shifting requirements, and legal challenges that can drag on for years.

The 732-mile TransWest Express transmission line from Wyoming to Nevada, for example, took nearly 18 years just to secure permits before breaking ground.

Duke Energy shuffles costs to make proposed Carolinas merger more attractive to SC

To support BMW expansions, battery component suppliers, and new industrial development corridors along the Interstate 85 spine, Duke Energy needs timely approvals for new substations, high-voltage transmission lines, and large-scale grid upgrades that often take longer to permit than to construct.

When these projects stall, reliability and affordability for families and businesses are put at risk.

When projects take too long to build, communities lose out on affordable power, new jobs, and private investment.

According to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, as much as $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment nationwide is tied up in the federal permitting process. A meaningful share of that investment is aimed at fast-growing states like South Carolina — if the infrastructure can actually be built.

Permitting reform is about restoring common sense. It means keeping environmental standards strong while making the approval process clear, efficient, and predictable.

The goal is not to cut corners, but to cut confusion.

That can be done by establishing firm timelines so projects can move from proposal to construction without endless waiting; designating a single coordinating agency to avoid duplicative reviews; prioritizing high-impact projects such as Upstate transmission upgrades; and creating a clear judicial review process so infrastructure that meets every requirement is not stuck in court for years.

Streamlining the process would save time and money without weakening safeguards. Federal reforms are especially important because many transmission projects require approvals from

multiple federal agencies before South Carolina utilities can even begin construction.

Today, a routine transmission line needed to power a new industrial supplier in Spartanburg County can take years longer to approve than to build. Substation upgrades serving fast-growing communities around Greer, Powdersville, and the western Upstate must often navigate multilayered reviews that move more slowly than the growth they are intended to support.

With targeted reforms, builders could move forward with confidence, and communities would benefit from lower costs and greater reliability as new energy sources and delivery systems come online sooner.

Permitting reform also strengthens America’s energy independence, and South Carolina’s competitiveness.

Much of the region’s electric grid is operating with equipment deep into the second half of its lifespan, even as demand accelerates. Federal energy analyses show that the United States will need to double the size of its electric grid by mid-century to support artificial intelligence, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and population growth, all trends already reshaping South Carolina.

When infrastructure can be built faster, energy becomes more affordable and more secure. Local industries, from battery manufacturing in the Midlands to aerospace and advanced-materials

suppliers across the Upstate, can expand with confidence.

And new employers deciding where to invest will see a state prepared for continued growth, not constrained by outdated processes.

Modernizing how projects are approved is not a partisan issue. It is a practical step toward a stronger economy and a more resilient energy system. Families deserve affordable electricity and

reliable service, and they deserve a government that helps make that possible.

The time to act is now. Modernizing the federal permitting process will lower costs, strengthen reliability, and keep energy affordable for every family and business in South Carolina.

Cutting red tape is not just good policy. It is essential to keeping our state’s momentum moving forward.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/transmission-lines-closeup-1024x5761763567353.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=872-yBh1,N,,2025-11-19 12:06:47.965509

By doubling down on hybrids, Toyota is addressing immediate consumer demand for practical, scalable solutions while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to future advancements in electrified mobility.","The global automotive industry is undergoing a significant shift as battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) continue to gain traction. According to the IEA, in 2025, electric car sales are expected to increase by 25% globally, similar to the growth rate in 2024, driven by regulatory mandates, environmental concerns, and advancements in battery technology. However, challenges such as limited charging infrastructure, battery costs, and supply chain constraints for critical materials like lithium and cobalt remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.

Amid these hurdles, hybrid vehicles emerge as a practical solution, serving as a vital bridge between traditional internal combustion engines (ICE) and fully electric vehicles (EVs). By combining a smaller battery with a gasoline engine, hybrids offer improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions without relying on extensive charging infrastructure, making them an accessible and efficient alternative in the transition toward electrification.

Toyota, one of the world’s largest automakers, has taken a more cautious approach to electrification. Last year, Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s Chairman, expressed doubts about the possibility of a complete transition to BEVs. He predicted that BEVs would likely reach a global ceiling of no more than 30% market share, citing infrastructure limitations, environmental concerns related to battery production, and the need for diversified powertrain solutions. Toyoda’s remarks sparked debate within the industry, as many automakers were doubling down on BEV production. However, Toyota’s recent announcement of a $912 million investment in hybrid vehicle production across its US manufacturing plants demonstrates the company’s commitment to a balanced and pragmatic electrification strategy.

Toyota’s pragmatic approach to electrification

Toyota’s decision to invest heavily in hybrid vehicle production reflects its belief in a multi-pathway strategy to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs). While many automakers are focusing exclusively on BEVs, Toyota is leveraging its expertise in hybrid technology to deliver scalable, practical solutions to reduce emissions. This approach aligns with Toyoda’s skepticism about the industry’s ability to overcome the challenges of mass BEV adoption.

Toyota Motor North America officially began production at its $13.9 billion battery manufacturing facility in Liberty, North Carolina, and this week announced a $912 million investment in hybrid production, underscoring its confidence in hybrids as a sustainable solution for the near term.

For example, Toyota’s West Virginia plant will receive $453 million to expand assembly of hybrid-compatible engines and transaxles, creating 80 new jobs. Similarly, the Kentucky plant, Toyota’s largest globally, will add an all-new machining line for hybrid-compatible engines with a $204.4 million investment and 82 new jobs. These investments highlight Toyota’s commitment to scaling hybrid technology to meet consumer demand while addressing BEV limitations.

Strategic diversification

Toyota’s multi-pathway strategy allows it to hedge against uncertainties in the BEV market. By investing in hybrids, plug-in hybrids, hydrogen fuel cells, and BEVs, Toyota ensures it remains competitive across a range of powertrain technologies. The company’s investment in hybrid production reflects its belief that electrification is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different regions and consumers have varying needs, and hybrids offer a practical and affordable option for those who may not yet be ready to transition to fully EVs. Toyota’s casting plants in Tennessee and Missouri, which will receive $71.4 million and $57.1 million, respectively, are set to increase hybrid component production capacity, further reinforcing the company’s diversified approach.

Reinforcing leadership in hybrids

Toyota has long been a pioneer in hybrid technology, with the Prius among the most iconic hybrid vehicles globally. The company’s latest investments in hybrid production reaffirm its leadership in this space and its commitment to refining and scaling hybrid technology.

The addition of hybrid-electric Corollas to Toyota’s U.S. production lineup is a significant milestone. The Blue Springs, Mississippi plant will receive $125 million to assemble the first electrified Corollas in the U.S., marking a new chapter in Toyota’s hybrid journey. This move not only strengthens Toyota’s hybrid portfolio but also demonstrates its ability to adapt to evolving market demands.

The future of Toyota in the US

The investments in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Missouri showcase Toyota’s dedication to strengthening its US manufacturing footprint. By creating new jobs across five manufacturing plants, Toyota is driving economic growth and reinforcing its position as a key player in the US automotive industry.

Beyond manufacturing, Toyota is also investing in the workforce of the future through the Toyota USA Foundation's initiative, Driving Possibilities. The company’s $110 million initiative aims to close educational gaps through hands-on STEM learning and support for PreK-12 education. This program not only prepares the next generation of engineers and scientists but also underscores Toyota’s commitment to innovation and sustainability.

By doubling down on hybrids, Toyota is addressing immediate consumer demand for practical, scalable solutions while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to future advancements in electrified mobility. This investment in US automotive manufacturing also underscores Toyota’s dedication to creating new opportunities for American worker. Equally important is Toyota’s investment in the U.S. workforce of the future, helping to close educational gaps and foster innovation through STEM learning. As Toyota continues to expand its U.S. operations, its commitment to hybrid technology, job creation, and workforce development positions it as a leader in sustainable mobility and a key contributor to the nation’s economic growth.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt9d1f20f1cd58baf6/691defca71c6a5c957cf5485/toyota-prius-2026.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-19 12:03:58.114731

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Nov. 17, 2025, provided a pre-publication version of their proposed rule intended to provide greater regulatory certainty by clarifying the definition of ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS).

The proposed rule aims to align with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Sackett EPA, which narrowed the scope of federal jurisdiction.

This Holland & Knight alert provides a summary of how the rule would define WOTUS moving forward.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Nov. 17, 2025, announced the release of a proposed rule revising the definition of ""waters of the United States"" (Proposed WOTUS Rule). The rule is intended to resolve the regulatory uncertainty that has persisted for decades regarding the scope of federal jurisdiction. (See Holland & Knight's previous alerts, ""Waters of the U.S. Rule Will Significantly Expand Federal Authority,"" Jan. 19, 2023, ""Sackett Decision Provides Clarity, Substantially Restricts Clean Water Act Jurisdiction Scope,"" May 26, 2023, and ""Waters of the United States Rule Revised in Response to Sackett Decision,"" Sept. 7, 2023.)

Among other things, the Proposed WOTUS Rule:

establishes that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features (e.g., a culvert) that provide predictable and consistent flow

defines critical terms consistent with the Sackett decision, including definitions of ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection"" with respect to adjacent wetlands

clarifies that ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent

removes automatic jurisdiction for ""interstate waters""

adds and expands certain exclusions for prior converted cropland, ditches, wastewater treatment systems and groundwater

The Proposed WOTUS Rule aligns with the goals of the 2025 WOTUS Guidance and rulemaking announcement, aiming to provide consistency that is squarely in line with the U.S. Supreme Court's reasoning in Sackett v. EPA and borrows some exclusion concepts from the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) promulgated during the first Trump Administration. Below summarizes the proposed amendments to the WOTUS definitions in 33 C.F.R. § 328.3 and 40 C.F.R. § 120.2.

New Proposed Definitions

The Proposed WOTUS Rule adds definitions for certain terms that are intended to guide application of the Sackett standard, including:

""Relatively permanent"" is proposed to be defined as ""standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season."" The Proposed WOTUS Rule makes clear that ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent. The agencies stated that the phrase ""at least during the wet season"" requires extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season, such as when average monthly precipitation exceeds average monthly evapotranspiration. The agencies are seeking comment on the most appropriate method to identify the wet season under the proposed definition of ""relatively permanent."" The proposed rule stresses the notion that such information should be readily available to ordinary citizens and trained professionals, such as through personal observations of field conditions. They indicate that they intend to use the metrics from the web-based Water-Budget Interactive Modeling Program (WebWIMP) as a primary source for identifying the wet season as opposed to brightline flow volumes or duration. There is an open question as to whether the flow would have to be during the entirety of the wet season or based on some proportion of that season, and they seek comment on that issue.

""Tributary"" is proposed to be defined as ""a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow."" The Proposed WOTUS Rule clarifies that features without relatively permanent flow would sever jurisdiction. This definition is fairly consistent with existing practice, essentially treating natural, man-altered and manmade waterbodies as tributaries as long as the waters meet the ""relatively permanent"" standard set forth in Sackett. Tributaries under the proposed rule may also connect through certain features, both natural (e.g., debris piles, boulder fields or beaver dams) and artificial (e.g., culverts, ditches, pipes, tunnels, pumps, tide gates or dams), even if such features themselves are non-jurisdictional under the proposed rule, as long as those features convey relatively permanent flow. The proposed rule solicits comment on all aspects of the proposed definition of ""tributary"" and implementation of the definition, including whether to require ""bed and banks or additional physical characteristics"" in the definition. The agencies also request comment whether manmade features can connect tributaries downstream when they convey relatively permanent flow or if they should sever downstream jurisdiction in all cases other than as part of a water transfer. Under past attempts to address this issue a tributary does not lose its jurisdictional status if it contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature such as a culvert, dam, tunnel or other similar artificial feature.

""Continuous surface connection,"" which is a prerequisite for adjacent wetlands to be considered WOTUS, is proposed to be defined as ""having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water,"" thereby creating a two-part test requiring both abutment of jurisdictional water and having surface water at least in the wet season. As described by the agencies, this proposed definition is intended to include wetlands that have ""at least semipermanent surface hydrology,"" which they believe satisfies the indistinguishability aspect of the Sackett decision, and excludes wetlands with only saturated soil fed by groundwater. Additionally, only the portion of the wetland that meets these two factors would be considered jurisdictional adjacent wetlands, regardless of the full scope of the wetland itself. The agencies also propose that culverts do not inherently sever the continuous surface connection when the culvert serves to extend the relatively permanent water. This would be demonstrated by relatively permanent water flow being present through the culvert, as well as an ordinary high watermark within the culvert, which provides the lateral limits of a tributary extending through the culvert. They are seeking comments on this approach, which would be likely very common such as when a stream passes under a roadway. The agencies seek comment on an alternative approach whereby wetlands, lakes and ponds would have a ""continuous surface connection"" only if they abut (i.e., touch) a jurisdictional water and have a perennial presence of surface water (i.e., it is year-round). Only wetlands that have permanent surface water, in addition to abutting a jurisdictional water, would be WOTUS under this alternative approach.

Proposed Changes to Exclusions

The Proposed WOTUS Rule proposes a new groundwater exclusion and revisions to certain existing exclusions, and adds corresponding definitions as follows:

Groundwater. The Proposed WOTUS Rule would add a new exclusion for groundwater, previously proposed in the 2020 NWPR, codifying the existing practice and historic understanding that groundwater is not WOTUS. The exclusion would expressly include groundwater drained through subsurface drainage systems.

Prior Converted Cropland. Under the existing 2023 WOTUS Rule, this existing exclusion expires upon a change in use of the land. The Proposed WOTUS Rule would clarify that the prior converted cropland exclusion would no longer apply when the cropland is abandoned for agricultural purposes for at least five years and the land has reverted to wetlands. The Proposed WOTUS Rule clarifies that the wetland is not automatically jurisdictional at that time; it would be jurisdictional only if it meets the requirements for an adjacent wetland. The Proposed WOTUS Rule also explains that ""agricultural purposes"" is broadly considered to include a variety of agricultural uses, including idling land for conservation uses and soil recovery.

Ditches. In an attempt to address confusion with respect to this existing exclusion, the Proposed WOTUS Rule proposes simply that all ditches, including roadside ditches, that are constructed or excavated entirely in dry land are not WOTUS, even if those ditches have relatively permanent flow and connect to jurisdictional waters. The only ""ditches"" that are intended to fall outside of this exclusion are tidal or navigable-in-fact ditches (i.e., canals).

Wastewater Treatment Systems. The agencies proposed to broaden this exclusion to include all components of a waste treatment system, which the agencies believe largely clarifies existing practice.

Proposed Removal of Interstate Waters and Intrastate Lakes and Ponds

The Proposed WOTUS Rule removes ""interstate waters"" from the WOTUS definition due to its overbreadth following Sackett. As explained by the agencies, ""interstate waters"" can be relatively permanent but do not have to be. Removal of ""interstate waters"" from the WOTUS definition removes an automatic jurisdictional determination with respect to such waters and instead requires them to be evaluated under the other jurisdictional categories and two-part test set forth in Sackett. The 2023 post-Sackett revisions to the 2023 WOTUS Rule already removed ""interstate wetlands"" from the WOTUS definition, meaning this proposed removal should not substantially affect the jurisdictional status of existing interstate wetlands.

For similar reasons, the agencies proposed to remove ""intrastate"" from the lakes and ponds category of the WOTUS definition to make clear that the ""relatively permanent"" standard applies regardless of whether the water is interstate or intrastate.

Impacts to Wetlands

Overall, with respect to wetlands, the Proposed WOTUS Rule reaffirms the existing law of the land set forth in Sackett that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection. The Regulatory Impact Analysis prepared by the agencies for the Proposed WOTUS Rule estimates that approximately 19 percent of wetlands listed on the National Wetlands Inventory would be considered WOTUS under the Proposed WOTUS Rule. In particular, the limitation of jurisdictional wetlands to those portions that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water are intended to further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection and aid the agencies in making jurisdictional determinations with respect to wetland mosaics.

The Proposed WOTUS Rule also provides implementation guidance for each of the above changes to clarify how these proposed changes would work in practice for field personnel.

Conclusion

This proposed rulemaking aims to solidify Sackett and provide clarity and durability to a longstanding debate. Only time will tell if the Proposed WOTUS Rule affords the finality that would benefit regulators and industry members alike.

The Trump administration’s war on clean energy has made it more difficult to build clean energy than some state-level policies once envisioned.
Democrats seem to believe the president’s war on clean energy has created a fresh rhetorical opening for them: They can now cast themselves as champions of cheap energy in all forms.
He said the Trump administration’s “assault” on clean energy made the pullback necessary.
Balik described the proposal as a “three-legged stool” of immediate rate relief, medium-term clean energy deployment, and long-term utility business model reform.","In state after state, governors and lawmakers are considering pulling back from their climate commitments — or have already reneged on them outright — out of a concern for the high costs that they could soon impose on voters. Democrats have justified the retreat by citing a new regime of sharper inflation, reduced federal support, and a need to deliver cheap energy of all kinds.

“We need to govern in reality,” New York Governor Kathy Hochul, for instance, said in a recent statement defending her approval of new natural gas infrastructure. “We are facing war against clean energy from Washington Republicans.”

Leaders in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California have all sounded similar notes while making or considering changes to their own states’ policies.

“The trend toward a different approach to energy policy that puts costs and pragmatism first is very real,” Josh Freed, the senior vice president for climate and energy programs at Third Way, a center-left think tank, told me.

“Affordability is the entry ticket for any other policy goal that politicians have,” he continued. “It particularly makes sense on climate and clean energy because we’ve all been talking for years about the need to electrify. If electricity is expensive, then electrification is simply not going to happen.”

The challenge is an old one for climate policy. Climate change — fueled by fossil fuel pollution — will ultimately raise costs through heat waves, extreme weather impacts, and a depleted natural world. But voters don’t go to the polls for lower costs in 2075. They want a cheaper cost of living now.

Democrats have more tools in this fight than ever before, with wind, solar, and batteries often much cheaper than other forms of generation. But to fully realize those cost savings — and to decarbonize the grid faster than utilities or power markets would otherwise go — politicians must push for politically or financially costly policies that speed up the transition, sometimes putting long-term climate goals ahead of near-term affordability concerns.

“We’ve been talking about affordability as the entry point and not the end of the story. It’s important to meet consumers and voters and elected officials where they are,” Justin Balik, the vice president for state policy at Evergreen Action, a climate-focused think tank and advocacy group, told me.

“We can make the argument — because the data is on our side — that clean energy is still cheaper and is a big part of lowering costs.”

Part of what’s driving this shift among Democrats on climate policy is economics. The Trump administration’s war on clean energy has made it more difficult to build clean energy than some state-level policies once envisioned. Many emissions reduction targets passed during the late 2010s or early 2020s — like New York’s, which requires the state to reduce emissions 40% from 1990 levels by 2030 and 85% by 2050 — assumed much faster clean electricity buildouts than have happened in practice. The president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will end wind and solar tax credits next year, driving up project costs in some cases by 40% more than once projected.

The president’s war on wind power, in particular, has hit particularly hard in Northeastern states, where grid managers once counted on thousands of megawatts of new offshore wind farms to supply power in the afternoon and evenings while meeting the states’ climate goals. The Trump administration has succeeded in cancelling virtually all of the Northeast’s offshore wind projects outside New York.

But economics do not explain all of the shifts. Democrats seem to believe the president’s war on clean energy has created a fresh rhetorical opening for them: They can now cast themselves as champions of cheap energy in all forms. Some have even revived the old Obama-era “all of the above” slogan for this new era.

“We have an energy crisis. Electricity prices for homeowners and businesses have gone up over 20% in New Jersey. The only answer is all of the above,” Representative Frank Pallone, the ranking member of the House energy committee, told Politico in September.

Even politicians who once championed climate change have downplayed it in recent speeches. New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who once described himself as a “proud ecosocialist,” barely mentioned climate change during his general election campaign for mayor.

Hochul’s recent moves illustrate the shift. Over the past year, she has delayed implementing New York’s cap-and-invest law, which seeks to reduce statewide carbon emissions 40% by 2030. She also paused the state’s ban on gas stoves and furnaces in new homes and low-rise buildings, which is due to go into effect next year. (A state court has ordered her to implement the cap-and-invest law by February.)

This month, Hochul approved two new natural gas pipelines as part of a rumored deal with the Trump administration to salvage New York’s wind farms. She defended the decision by appealing to — you guessed it — affordability.

“We have adopted an all-of-the-above approach that includes a continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability,” she said in a statement.

New York’s neighbors have gone down similar paths. In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro struck a budget compromise with Republican lawmakers that will remove the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, a compact of Northeastern states to cap carbon pollution from power plants and invest the resulting revenue.

Shapiro blamed Republicans, who he said have “used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy,” but said he was focused on — yes, again— “cutting costs.”

“I’m going to be aggressive about pushing for policies that create more jobs in the energy sector, bring more clean energy onto the grid, and reduce the cost of energy for Pennsylvanians,” he said before signing the budget deal.

California has also reworked its own climate policy in response to cost-of-living concerns. Earlier this year, it passed an energy package that re-upped its cap-and-trade program while allowing new oil extraction in south-central Kern County. The legislation was partly driven by a fear that local refineries would shutter — and gas prices could soar — without more crude production.

Massachusetts could soon join the pullback. Earlier this month, the state’s House of Representatives fast-tracked a bill that included a provision nullifying a legal mandate to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels.

While the bill preserved the state’s longer-term goal to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, it rendered the 2030 mandate “advisory in nature and unenforceable.”

“The number one goal is to save money and adjust to the reality with clean energy,” Representative Mark Cusack, co-chair of the energy and utilities committee and the bill’s sponsor, told the local Commonwealth Beacon. He said the Trump administration’s “assault” on clean energy made the pullback necessary. “We want to get there, but if we’re going to miss our mandates and it’s not the fault of ours, it’s incumbent on us not to get sued and not have the ratepayers be on the hook,” he said.

Cusack’s bill also included measures to transform the state’s Mass Save program — which helps households and businesses to switch to electrified heating and appliances — by dropping the program’s climate mandate and its ban on buying efficient natural gas appliances.

On Monday, lawmakers removed the mandate provision from the bill but preserved its other reforms. While the bill is no longer fast tracked, they could choose to revisit the legislation as soon as next year.

New Jersey may also revisit its own climate commitments. Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill swept to victory this month in part by promising to freeze state utility rates. She could do that in part by lifting or suspending certain “social benefit charges” now placed on state power bills.

In the long term, though, Sherrill will have to pursue other policies to lower rates. Researchers at Evergreen Action and the National Resources Defense Council have argued that changing the state’s electricity policies could lower carbon emissions while saving ratepayers more than $400 a year by 2030.

Balik described the proposal as a “three-legged stool” of immediate rate relief, medium-term clean energy deployment, and long-term utility business model reform. He also mourned that other states have not used revenue from their climate programs to pay for climate programs.

“There’s a danger of looking at cost concerns a little myopically,” he said. “Cap and invest [in New York] was paused for the stated reason that it’s not helpful with cost, but you could use cap-and-invest revenues to pay for things on the rate base now.”

THE TOP FIVE

1. FEMA head is out

David Richardson, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, resigned Monday after just six months on the job. Richardson had no experience in managing natural disasters, and Axios reported, he “faced sharp criticism for being unavailable” amid the extreme floods that left 130 dead in Central Texas in July. A month earlier, Richardson raised eyebrows when he held a meeting in which he told staff he was unaware the U.S. had a hurricane season. He was, however, a “loyalist” to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, CNN reported.

With hurricane season wrapping up this month, President Donald Trump was preparing to fire Richardson in the lead up to an overhaul of the agency, whose resources for carrying out disaster relief he wants to divvy up among the states. When FEMA staffers criticized the move in an open letter over the summer, the agency suspended 40 employees who signed with their names, as I wrote in the newsletter at the time.

2. EPA slashes wetland protections

The Environmental Protection Agency proposed stripping federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams. The New York Times cast the stakes of the rollback as “potentially threatening sources of clean drinking water for millions of Americans” while delivering “a victory for a range of business interests that have lobbied to scale back the Clean Water Act of 1972, including farmers, home builders, real estate developers, oil drillers and petrochemical manufacturers.” At an event announcing the rulemaking, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin recognized that the proposal “is going to be met with a lot of relief from farmers, ranchers, and other landowners and governments.” Under the Clean Water Act, companies and individuals need to obtain permits from the EPA before releasing pollutants into the nation’s waterways, and permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before discharging any dredged or fill material such as sand, silt, or construction debris. Yet just eliminating the federal oversight doesn’t necessarily free developers and farmers of permitting challenges since that jurisdiction simply goes to the state.

3. Power outages are getting longer across the U.S.

A chart from the report shows how much worse this year is than previous ones.J.D. Power

Americans are spending greater lengths of time in the dark amid mounting power outages, according to a new survey by the data analytics giant J.D. Power. The report, released last month but highlighted Monday in Utility Dive, cited “increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events” as the cause. The average length of the longest blackout of the year increased in all regions since 2022, from 8.1 hours to 12.8 by the midpoint of 2025. Ratepayers in the South reported the longest outages, averaging 18.2 hours, followed by the West, at 12.4 hours. While the duration of outages is worsening, the number of Americans experiencing them isn’t, J.D. Power’s director of utilities intelligence, Mark Spalinger, told Utility Dive. The percentage of ratepayers experiencing “perfect power” without any interruptions is gradually rising, he said, but disasters like storms and fires “are becoming so much more extreme that it creates these longer outage events that utilities are now having to deal with.”

The problem is particularly bad in the summertime. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin explained back in June, “the demands on the grid are growing at the same time the resources powering it are changing. Between broad-based electrification, manufacturing additions, and especially data center construction, electricity load growth is forecast to grow several percent a year through at least the end of the decade. At the same time, aging plants reliant on oil, gas, and coal are being retired (although planned retirements are slowing down), while new resources, largely solar and batteries, are often stuck in long interconnection queues — and, when they do come online, offer unique challenges to grid operators when demand is high.”

4. A solar manufacturer says it’s opening another factory thanks to Trump

You win some, you lose some. Earlier this month, solar developer Pine Gate Renewables blamed the Trump administration’s policies in its bankruptcy filing. Now a major solar manufacturer is crediting its expansion plans to the president. Arizona-based First Solar said last week it plans to open a new panel factory in South Carolina. The $330 million factory will create 600 new jobs, E&E News reported, if it comes online in the second half of next year as planned. First Solar said the investment is the result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. “The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Administration’s trade policies boosted demand for American energy technology, requiring a timely, agile response that allows us to meet the moment,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said in a statement. “We expect that this new facility will enable us to serve the U.S. market with technology that is compliant with the Act’s stringent provisions, within timelines that align with our customers’ objectives.”

If you want to review what actually goes into making a solar panel, it’s worth checking out Matthew’s explainer from the Climate 101 series.

5. France’s oil giant is making a big bet on electricity

French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies said Monday it would make a $6 billion investment into power plants across Europe, expanding what The Wall Street Journal called “a strategy that has set it apart from rivals focused on pumping more fossil fuels.” To start, the company agreed to buy 50% of a portfolio of assets owned by Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding, the investment fund controlled by the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. While few question the rising value of power generation amid a surge in electricity demand from the data centers supporting artificial intelligence software, analysts and investors “question whether investment in power generation — particularly renewables — will be as lucrative as oil and gas.” Rivals Shell and BP, for example, recently axed their renewables businesses to double down on fossil fuels.

THE KICKER

The world has successfully stored as much carbon dioxide as 81,044,946 gasoline-powered cars would emit in a year. The first-ever audit of all major carbon storage projects in the U.S., China, Brazil, Australia, and the Middle East found over 383 million tons of carbon dioxide stored since 1996. “The central message from our report is that CCS works, demonstrating a proven capability and accelerating momentum for geologic storage of CO2,” Samuel Krevor, a professor of subsurface carbon storage at Imperial College London’s Department of Earth Science and Engineering, said in a press release.

What will most likely happen, Abraham Silverman, a Johns Hopkins University scholar who previously served as the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ general counsel, told me, is that New Jersey’s four major electric utilities will work with the governor to deliver on her promise, finding ways to shave off spending and show some forbearance.

Indeed, “We stand ready to work with the incoming administration to do our part to keep rates as low as possible in the short term and work on longer-term solutions to add supply,” Ralph LaRossa, the chief executive of PSE&G, one of the major utilities in New Jersey, told analysts on an earnings call held the day before the election.

PSE&G’s retail bills rose 36% this past summer, according to the investment bank Jefferies. As for what working with the administration might look like, “We expect management to offer rate concessions,” Jefferies analyst Paul Zimbrado wrote in a note to clients in the days following the election, meaning essentially that the utility would choose to eat some higher costs. PSE&G might also get “creative,” which could mean things like “extensions of asset recoverable lives, regulatory item amortization acceleration, and other approaches to deliver customer bill savings in the near-term,” i.e. deferring or spreading out costs to minimize their immediate impact. “These would be cash flow negative but [PSE&G] has the cushion to absorb it,” Zimbrado wrote.

In return, Silverman told me that the New Jersey utilities “have a wish list of things they want from the administration and from the legislature,” including new nuclear plants, owning generation, and investing in energy storage. “I think that they are probably incented to work with the new administration to come up with that list of items that they think they can accomplish again without sacrificing reliability.”

Well before the election, in a statement issued in August responding to Sherrill’s energy platform, PSE&G hinted toward a path forward in its dealings with the state, noting that it isn’t allowed to build or own power generation and arguing that this deregulatory step “precluded all New Jersey electric companies from developing or offering new sources of power supply to meet rising demand and reduce prices.” Of course, the failure to get new supply online has bedeviled regulators and policymakers throughout the PJM Interconnection, of which New Jersey is a part. If Mikie Sherrill can figure out how to get generation online quickly in New Jersey, she’ll have accomplished something more impressive than a rate freeze.

As for ways to accomplish the governor-elect’s explicit goal of keeping price increases at zero, Silverman suggested that large-scale investments could be paid off on a longer timeline, which would reduce returns for utilities. Other investments could be deferred for at least a few years in order to push out beyond the current “bubble” of high costs due to inflation. That wouldn’t solve the problem forever, though, Silverman told me. It could simply mean “seeing lower costs today, but higher costs in the future,” he said.

New Jersey will also likely have to play a role in deliberations happening in front of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about interconnecting large loads — i.e. data centers — a major driver of costs throughout PJM and within New Jersey specifically. Rules that force data centers to “pay their own way” for transmission costs associated with getting on the grid could relieve some of the New Jersey price crunch, Silverman told me. “I think that will be a really significant piece.”

Then there’s the hard way — slashing utilities’ regulated rates of return.

In a report prepared for the Natural Resources Defence Council and Evergreen Collective and released after the election, Synapse Economics considered reducing utilities’ regulated return on equity, the income they’re allowed to generate on their investments in the grid, from its current level of 9.6% as one of four major levers to bring down prices. A two percentage point reduction in the return on equity, the group found, would reduce annual bills by $40 in 2026.

Going after the return on equity would be a more difficult, more contentious path than working cooperatively on deferring costs and increasing generation, Silverman told me. If voluntary and cooperative solutions aren’t enough to stop rate increases, however, Sherrill might choose to take it anyway. “You could come in and immediately cut that rate of return, and that would absolutely put downward pressure on rates in the short run. But you establish a very contentious relationship with the utilities,” Silverman told me.

Silverman pointed to Connecticut, where regulators and utilities developed a hostile relationship in recent years, resulting in the state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority chair, Marissa Gillett, stepping down last month. Gillett had served on PURA since 2019, and had tried to adopt “performance-based ratemaking,” where utility payouts wouldn’t be solely determined by their investment level, but also by trying to meet public policy goals like energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Connecticut utilities said these rules would make attracting capital to invest in the grid more difficult. Gillett’s tenure was also marred by lawsuits from the state’s utilities over accusations of “bias” against them in the ratemaking process. At the same time, environmental and consumer groups hailed her approach.

While Sherrill and her energy officials may not want to completely overhaul how they approach ratemaking, some conflict with the state’s utilities may be necessary to deliver on her signature campaign promise.

Going directly after the utilities’ regulated return “is kind of like making your kid eat their broccoli,” Silverman said. “You can probably make them eat it. You can have a very contentious evening for the rest of the night.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIwNjk5NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgyMDk3MjU4MH0.VA5lLGANmfvrkU2pFa7YBxm6cdPSKQ226GYzylRh7j0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:08.488627

E-1 – System Energy Resources (Docket No. ER25-2258-001). On May 19, 2025, System Energy Resources (SERI) filed proposed amendments to the effective Unit Power Sales Agreement (UPSA) on file with the Commission. SERI owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, a generating facility located in Mississippi, and makes capacity and energy sales to four of its affiliated public utilities as part of Entergy Services, LLC. Namely, SERI sought to revise entitlement percentages under the wholesale rate schedule, pursuant to a settlement approved by the Commission in November 2024, for Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Arkansas, and Entergy Louisiana. Additionally, Entergy Louisiana would be removed as a party to the UPSA (and its entitlement reduced to zero percent). On June 9, 2025, the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) submitted a protest, contending that SERI did not sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed revised UPSA entitlement percentages would be just and reasonable in accordance with Section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and that SERI did not show that the proposed revisions would be consistent with the public interest. On June 9, 2025, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) filed comments in support of the proposed revisions to entitlement percentages. On July 31, 2025, the Commission issued an order accepting the revised UPSA, finding that the revised entitlement percentages based on their life-of-unit purchases are just and reasonable. On September 2, 2025, APSC filed a request for rehearing of the July 31 order. Agenda item E-1 may be an order on the rehearing request.

E-2 – System Energy Resources (Docket No. ER22-24-002). On October 1, 2021, SERI filed proposed changes to the effective UPSA, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, in order to allow for the inclusion of prepaid and accrued pension costs in rate base associated with its qualified pension plans. In the filing, SERI stated that the inputs for the proposed pension changes originate from the qualified pension plan data contained in its annual FERC Form 1 filings as supplemented by certain accounting records. On October 22, 2021 and November 2, 2021, respectively, LPSC submitted a protest and supplemental protest, asserting that the actuarial approach proposed by SERI in order to calculate the ""prepaid"" pension expense is faulty and that SERI relied on misleading representations in its proposal. LPSC also stated that SERI did not furnish the appropriate data that would aid the Commission in evaluating the prepaid or accrued pension costs. On November 23, 2021, SERI filed an answer to the LPSC protests, stating that LPSC offered factually incorrect or irrelevant assertions to the calculation of prepaid pension costs. On March 15, 2022, the Commission issued an order accepting and suspending for a period the proposed revisions, subject to refund, and establishing settlement judge procedures. Over the ensuing months, an administrative law judge (ALJ) presided over seven settlement proceedings among the parties. On August 7, 2023, the chief judge issued an order terminating the settlement proceedings, and designated a presiding judge to preside over a final hearing and subsequently issue an Initial Decision on the outstanding material issues. On September 6, 2023, a prehearing conference between the parties was held. On October 16, 2023, SERI filed a partial settlement to resolve whether it had properly classified accumulated deferred income tax in the calculation of prepaid pension cost under the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts. The Commission approved the partial settlement as uncontested on January 18, 2024. On May 21, 2024, the parties commenced the hearing, which concluded on May 31, 2024. A post-hearing conference was subsequently held on June 12, 2024. On September 6, 2024, the chief judge issued the Initial Decision, finding that the ""preponderance of substantial evidence"" in the hearing record supported the proposition that the Commission should approve the proposed FPA Section 205 amendment to the UPSA and its embedded formula rate to include a line item for prepaid (i.e., accrued) pension cost in rate base. On October 7, 2024, the parties submitted respective Briefs on Exceptions with respect to the Initial Decision; on October 28, 2024, the parties submitted respective Briefs Opposing Exceptions. Agenda item E-2 may be an order on the Initial Decision and outstanding material issues.

E-3 – Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Docket No. ER24-3032-000). On September 13, 2024, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) submitted a compliance filing, pursuant to Order No. 2023 and Order No. 2023-A, with respect to proposed amendments to its Wholesale Distribution Tariff (WDT). The PG&E WDT describes the terms under which PG&E provides open access to its distribution system to wholesale customers seeking to interconnect wholesale generation facilities. Order No. 2023, issued by the Commission on July 28, 2023, reformed the generator interconnection study processes of public utility transmission providers operating under effective OATTs. Primarily, Order No. 2023 required that transmission providers employ a first-ready, first-served cluster study process for large generating facilities exceeding 20 MW. Order No. 2023-A, issued on March 21, 2024, extended the compliance deadline to May 16, 2024. The Commission did not find that Order No. 2023 fully applied to WDTs but nonetheless directed PG&E and distribution system providers to ""address its concerns and applicability in its individual compliance filing,"" due within 90 calendar days of the Order No. 2023 compliance filings of the relevant Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. In the compliance filing, PG&E stated that it has already incorporated many of the reforms set forth in Order No. 2023. Although it does not align precisely with all of the reforms proposed by the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO), PG&E stated that it generally fashioned its compliance filing based on the form and structure of the CAISO Order No. 2023 compliance filing submitted on May 16, 2024. On October 4, 2024, California Energy Storage Alliance (CESA) filed a protest, contending that the PG&E compliance filing fails to provide interconnection customers with electric storage resources the ability to design and charge their facilities in a manner that would satisfy the proposed operating parameters. On October 15, 2024, PG&E filed an answer to the protest, stating that Order No. 2023 did not require utilities to use the proposed operating parameters or assumptions of an interconnection customer. Agenda item E-3 may be an order on the PG&E compliance filing.

E-4 – San Diego Gas & Electric Company (Docket No. ER10-1391-003). On August 28, 2024, San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) submitted a compliance filing, pursuant to Order No. 2023 and Order No. 2023-A, with respect to proposed amendments to its Wholesale Distribution Access Tariff (WDAT). The SDG&E WDAT describes the terms under which SDG&E provides open access to its distribution system to wholesale customers seeking to interconnect wholesale generation facilities. Order No. 2023, issued by the Commission on July 28, 2023, reformed the generator interconnection study processes of public utility transmission providers operating under effective OATTs. Primarily, Order No. 2023 required that transmission providers employ a first-ready, first-served cluster study process for large generating facilities exceeding 20 MW. Order No. 2023-A, issued on March 21, 2024, extended the compliance deadline to May 16, 2024. The Commission did not find that Order No. 2023 fully applied to WDATs but nonetheless directed SDG&E and distribution system providers to ""address its concerns and applicability in its individual compliance filing,"" due within 90 calendar days of the Order No. 2023 compliance filings of the relevant Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. Although it does not align precisely with all of the reforms proposed CAISO, SDG&E stated that it generally fashioned its compliance filing based on the form and structure of the CAISO Order No. 2023 compliance filing submitted on May 16, 2024. On September 18, 2024, CESA, Clean Energy Alliance and Community Power, and the Clean Coalition, respectively, filed protests of the SDG&E compliance filing, generally alleging that the proposed elimination of its Independent Study Process (ISP) for small generators would impede the ability of small generators to interconnect to SDG&E in a timely and efficient manner. Further, the protests echoed the concerns raised by CESA in the PG&E Order No. 2023 compliance proceeding discussed in agenda item E-3, namely that the operating assumptions for electric storage resources would fail to permit the control technologies that ensure operation within ""agreed-upon parameters."" On November 4, 2024, SDG&E submitted an answer to the respective protests, stating that it does not expressly prohibit certain practices (i.e., by removing the ISP but preserving the Fast Track serial screening process) in order to strike a balance ""between preserving the interests of small and large generator interconnection customers."" On August 1, 2025, San Diego Community Power, et al. submitted a motion for expedited consideration. Agenda item E-4 may be an order on the SDG&E compliance filing.

E-5 – Southern California Edison Company (Docket Nos. ER24-2776-000, ER24-2776-001). On August 14, 2024, Southern California Edison Company (SCE) submitted a compliance filing, pursuant to Order No. 2023 and Order No. 2023-A, with respect to proposed amendments to its WDAT. The SCE WDAT describes the terms under which SCE provides open access to its distribution system to wholesale customers seeking to interconnect wholesale generation facilities. Order No. 2023, issued by the Commission on July 28, 2023, reformed the generator interconnection study processes of public utility transmission providers operating under effective OATTs. Primarily, Order No. 2023 required that transmission providers employ a first-ready, first-served cluster study process for large generating facilities exceeding 20 MW. Order No. 2023-A, issued on March 21, 2024, extended the compliance deadline to May 16, 2024. The Commission did not find that Order No. 2023 fully applied to WDATs but nonetheless directed SCE and distribution system providers to ""address its concerns and applicability in its individual compliance filing,"" due within 90 calendar days of the Order No. 2023 compliance filings of the relevant Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator. Although it does not align precisely with all of the reforms proposed CAISO, SCE stated that it generally fashioned its compliance filing based on the form and structure of the CAISO Order No. 2023 compliance filing submitted on May 16, 2024. On September 4, 2024, Terra-Gen, LLC filed a protest, asserting that certain proposed deviations from pro forma provisions (namely, by failing to include the option for interconnection customers to provide operation assumptions) are neither consistent or superior to Commission requirements. On September 20, 2024, SCE filed an answer to the protest, stating that Order No. 2023 did not address operating assumptions for transmission or distribution service, and the assertion that SCE should be compelled to include at least one electric storage operating assumption would be assessed as part of the distribution service request, not interconnection service. Agenda item E-5 may be an order on the SCE compliance filing.

E-6 – EDF power solutions Development, Inc. (Docket No. EL25-111-000). On August 7, 2025, EDF power solutions Development, Inc. (EDF), on behalf of its subsidiary Rainbow Valley Energy Center, LLC, filed a petition for declaratory order, pursuant to Rule 207 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Commission. EDF stated that, on November 7, 2023, Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (SRP) submitted its new Large Generator Interconnection Process (LGIP) following the issuance of Order No. 2023. According to EDF, SRP failed to implement Order No. 2023 with respect to the affected system study process, which resulted in SRP removing Rainbow Valley from the interconnection queue. EDF stated that, ""through no fault of Rainbow Valey and because of causes beyond its control,"" it had problems receiving certain affected system studies on a timely basis. On July 16, 2025, EDF sent a letter to SRP invoking dispute resolution processes and asserting force majeure under the SRP LGIP. On July 17, 2025, SRP notified EDF that it had withdrawn Rainbow Valley from the interconnection queue. On September 8, 2025, SRP filed a protest, stating that it had withdrawn its Safe Harbor status years prior, although it continues to provide reciprocal service to other transmission facilities. As such, SRP contends that because EDF itself does not offer transmission service by which SRP could reciprocate, the request is moot. On September 8, 2025, the American Public Power Association, Large Public Power Council, and National Rural Electric Cooperative Association also filed a protest, stating that the requested relief would contravene Commission precedent and that the Commission lacks statutory authority to issue such an order declaring that SRP's reciprocity tariff is no longer valid, as EDF sought. Agenda item E-6 may be an order on the petition.

Miscellaneous

M-1 – Duty of Candor (Docket No. RM22-20-000). On July 28, 2022, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR), pursuant to Sections 206, 215, 307, and 309 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), Sections 5, 14, and 16 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), Sections 1(5)(a), 12(1)(a), 13, and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), Sections 311(c) and 501(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), and Sections 402(a)(2) and 402(h) of the Department of Energy Organization Act. In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to add a new section to 18 CFR part 1 to require that any entity communicating with the Commission or other specified organizations submit accurate and factual information, and to not submit false or misleading information, or to omit material information. The Commission stated that a ""broadly applicable duty of candor"" will improve its ability to effectively conduct oversight on the jurisdictional markets under its authority. A large number of stakeholders and interested parties submitted comments, including joint comments by certain RTOs including ISO New England (ISO-NE), Midcontinent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), and Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) on November 10, 2022. The joint RTO comments generally expressed support for the NOPR, stating that ""it is important for the duty of candor to apply broadly to all information related to the administration of the RTO markets (including matters such as organizational structure, membership and credit matters)."" Other comments, such as those filed by the American Public Power Association on November 10, 2022, expressed concern with respect to the ""exceptionally broad"" scope of the NOPR, and was particularly concerned as it would relate to communications with entities other than the Commission and its staff (i.e., if the NOPR were to apply to all communications with RTOs, ISOs, market monitors, the Electric Reliability Organization and its regional entities, and so forth). Agenda item M-1 may be an order furnishing a Final Rule on duty of candor.

M-2 – Waiver of Tariff Requirements (Docket No. PL20-7-000). On May 21, 2020, the Commission issued a Proposed Policy Statement to clarify requests for waiver of tariff provisions. The Commission stated that reviewing courts had instructed that ""[t]he filed rate doctrine and the rule against retroactive ratemaking leave the Commission no discretion to waive the operation of a filed rate or to retroactively change or adjust a rate for good cause or for any other equitable considerations."" Accordingly, the Commission determined that, under some circumstances, it has issued tariff waiver orders beyond the limits imposed by the filed rate doctrine. Under both Section 206 of the FPA and Section 5 of the NGA, the Commission is not permitted to allow retroactive changes to filed rates. A number of stakeholders and interested parties filed comments, generally offering feedback on exceptions to waivers of the prior notice requirement and other circumstances that do not violate the filed rate doctrine but continue to provide for some manner of flexibility. Agenda item M-2 may be an order on the Proposed Policy Statement.

Gas

G-1 – Supplemental Review of the Oil Pipeline Index Level (Docket No. RM25-2-000). On October 17, 2024, the Commission issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Supplemental NOPR) proposing to amend the index level used to determine annual charges to oil pipeline rate ceilings in light of the decision issued in Liquid Energy Pipeline Association v. FERC by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Commission proposed to use the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG) minus 0.21 percent as the prospective index level for the remainder of the five-year period that began on July 1, 2021. A number of stakeholders and interested parties filed initial comments, with some concerns expressed about the frequency of the review (i.e., deviating from prior Commission policy to revise the Five-Year Index within four years). Certain parties raised the prospect of a destabilizing effect on regulated pipelines due to the potential implementation of new rates outside of the typical timeframe. On December 20, 2024, respectively, some parties filed reply comments, stating that the Supplemental NOPR would appropriately reinstate the oil pipeline index of PPI-FG minus 0.28 percent. Agenda item G-1 may be an order on the Supplemental NOPR.

G-2 – Revisions to Oil Pipeline Regulations Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Docket No. RM93-11-003); Five-Year Review of the Oil Pipeline Index (Docket Nos. RM20-14-003, RM20-14-004). On September 17, 2024, the Commission issued an order reinstating the oil pipeline index level of Producer Price Index for Finished Goods plus 0.78 percent, in accordance with the directive of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Liquid Energy Pipeline Association v. FERC. The reinstated oil pipeline index level would revert to the order issued by the Commission on December 17, 2020. On October 3, 2024, the Liquids Shippers Group filed a request for clarification, or, in the alternative, rehearing of the September 17 order. In the request, the Liquids Shippers Group sought clarification that any filings made by pipelines to increase their ceiling levels and/or indexed rates pursuant to the order would be made effective subject to refund and any subsequent action taken by the Commission, in the event that the Commission modifies the index level downward in the future. Agenda item G-2 may be an order on the request for clarification or rehearing.

G-3 – Airlines for America and National Propane Gas Association (Docket No. RM18-10-000). On February 1, 2017, Airlines for America and National Propane Gas Association (collectively, Petitioners) submitted a petition for rulemaking in order to apply its existing affiliate Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers regulations to crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and petroleum product pipelines, pursuant to Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, and 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA). Petitioners stated that a lack of Commission regulations with respect to the marketing of certain commodities on interstate transmission pipelines led to ""slower and more cautious decision making by non-affiliated shippers."" Petitioners also stated that, unlike the electric power and natural gas sectors under Commission jurisdiction, the use of transmission function information by marketing affiliates of oil pipelines is not controlled or monitored by its regulations. Accordingly, Petitioners asked that the Commission assert its legal authority under the ICA to expand such regulations to crude oil, NGL, and petroleum product pipelines. A number of stakeholders and interested parties filed comments and protests, generally opposing the petition. The protests contended that Petitioners sought to impose new regulatory programs without sufficient justification, and that such potential requirements would lead to a significant administrative burden and increase in costs. Other protests stated that Petitioners falsely claimed that a large number of oil pipelines function as ""natural monopolies"" and therefore their regulatory treatment should be tantamount to the electric power and natural gas sectors. Agenda item G-3 may be an order on the petition.

G-4 – Safe Harbor Policy for Data Providers to Price Index Developers (Docket No. RM20-7-000). On December 17, 2020, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) with respect to amending its regulations in order to codify the Safe Harbor Policy established in its Policy Statement on Natural Gas and Electric Price Indices. In the NOPR, the Commission stated that, under the Safe Harbor Policy, data providers that report transactions to natural gas and electric price index developers are afforded a rebuttable presumption that their transaction data is accurate, timely, and submitted in good faith. Accordingly, the NOPR would ""promote voluntary reporting"" of such transactions and alleviate market participant concerns that the Safe Harbor Policy is not binding. A number of stakeholders filed comments generally supporting the language outlined in the NOPR. Agenda item G-4 may be an order on the NOPR.

C-2 – Northwest Pipeline LLC (Docket No. CP25-89-000); Portland General Electric Company, B-R Pipeline, LLC and KB Pipeline Company (Docket No. CP25-90-000). On February 27, 2025, Northwest Pipeline LLC (Northwest) submitted an abbreviated application, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) authorizing it to acquire, own, operate, and maintain the existing Kelso-Beaver Pipeline. According to Northwest, the acquisition will become a lateral extension of its existing interstate natural gas transmission system. Northwest also sought authorization to expand the existing pipeline into a bi-directional pipeline, upon acquisition, and to construct a new compressor station. A number of stakeholders filed comments in support of the abbreviated application. On April 28, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from Northwest. On May 5, 2025, Northwest filed a response to the deficiency letter. On May 5, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from Northwest in order to assist in the environmental analysis for the project. On May 23, 2025, Northwest filed a response to the environmental data request. On August 22, 2025, the Commission issued the Environmental Assessment, finding that approval of the proposed project would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Agenda item C-2 may be an order on the CPCN application.

C-3 – Distrigas of Massachusetts LLC (Docket No. CP25-207-000). On April 14, 2025, Distrigas of Massachusetts LLC (DOMAC) submitted an application, pursuant to Section 3 of the NGA, for authorization of a limited amendment to modify its existing facilities. In the application, DOMAC stated that it intended to incorporate new equipment and control instruments that will allow it to install a redundant boil-off gas compressor to capture boil-off gas emissions from its liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage system. On May 8, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from DOMAC in order to assist in the environmental analysis for the project. On May 19, 2025, DOMAC filed a response to the environmental data request. On June 27, 2025, the Commission issued the Environmental Assessment, finding that approval of the proposed project would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Agenda item C-3 may be an order on the limited amendment.

C-4 – Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (Docket No. CP25-29-000). On December 11, 2024, Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (EGTS) submitted an abbreviated application, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the NGA, for a CPCN authorizing it to construct, install, own, operate, and maintain certain interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. According to EGTS, the proposed facilities would comprise the Capital Project, which would provide firm natural gas transportation service to one fully subscribed, non-affiliated customer. A number of parties and stakeholders, including elected officials and trade groups, filed comments generally in support of the project. On January 16, 2025, the Commission issued a letter requesting additional information from EGTS in order to assist in the environmental analysis for the project. On January 22, 2025, EGTS filed a response to the environmental data request. The Commission issued subsequent environmental data requests on February 19, 2025 and May 5, 2025, respectively; EGTS filed responses to those requests on March 7, 2025 and May 12, 2025. On July 30, 2025, EGTS submitted the State Water Quality Certification, pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on July 23, 2025. On August 8, 2025, the Commission issued the Environmental Assessment, finding that approval of the proposed project would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

It was under this scenario that Bressler estimated that, by 2100, climate change will have caused 83 million people to die of temperature-related deaths around the world.","New advances in environmental science are providing a detailed understanding of the human costs of the Trump administration’s approach to climate change.

Increasing temperatures are already killing enormous numbers of people. A ProPublica and Guardian analysis that draws on sophisticated modeling by independent researchers found that President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda of expanding fossil fuels and decimating efforts to reduce emissions will add substantially to that toll, with the vast majority of deaths occurring outside the United States.

Most of the people expected to die from soaring temperatures in the coming decades live in poor, hot countries in Africa and South Asia, according to recent research. Many of these countries emitted relatively little of the pollution that causes climate change — and are least prepared to cope with the increasing heat.

ProPublica and the Guardian’s analysis shows that extra greenhouse gases released in the next decade as a result of Trump’s policies are expected to lead to as many as 1.3 million more temperature-related deaths worldwide in the 80 years after 2035. The actual number of people who die from heat will be much higher, but a warming planet will also result in fewer deaths from cold.

Leaders from most of the world’s countries are now gathered at an international conference in Belém, Brazil, to address the escalating effects of climate change. The absence of the United States, which has 4% of the world’s population but has produced 20% of its greenhouse gases, has been pointedly noted by participants. Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino are the only other nations that did not send a delegation to the meeting, according to a provisional list of participants.

Our calculations use modeled estimates of the additional emissions that will be released as a result of Trump’s policies as well as a peer-reviewed metric for what is known as the mortality cost of carbon. That metric, which builds on Nobel Prize-winning science that has informed federal policy for more than a decade, predicts the number of temperature-related deaths from additional emissions. The estimate reflects deaths from heat-related causes, such as heat stroke and the exacerbation of existing illnesses, minus lives saved by reduced exposure to cold. It does not include the massive number of deaths expected from the broader effects of climate change, such as droughts, floods, wars, vector-borne diseases, hurricanes, wildfires and reduced crop yields.

The numbers, while large, are just a fraction of the estimated 83 million temperature-related deaths that could result from all human-caused emissions over the same period if climate-warming pollution is not curtailed. But they speak to the human cost of prioritizing U.S. corporate interests over the lives of people around the globe.

“The sheer numbers are horrifying,” said Ife Kilimanjaro, executive director of the nonprofit U.S. Climate Action Network, which works with groups around the world to combat climate change.

“But for us they’re more than numbers,” she added. “These are people with lives, with families, with hopes and dreams. They are people like us, even if they happen to live in a different part of the world.”

The Trump administration, sometimes with the help of congressional Republicans, has dramatically set back efforts to limit climate change, cutting tax credits for clean electricity, fuels, vehicles and manufacturing; easing pollution restrictions on coal-fired power plants; and gutting fuel standards on cars, to name just a few of the climate initiatives that were recently reversed.

“Prior to Trump, we had the most ambitious climate policy that the U.S. has ever come up with — our best effort to date by far of addressing this growing problem,” said Marshall Burke, an economist at the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University.

“When we roll these things back, it is fundamentally affecting the damages we’re going to see around the world,” said Burke.

Responding to questions about the reversals and their projected consequences, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers attacked what she referred to as the “Green Energy Scam.” “America still doesn’t buy the left’s bogus climate claims,” she wrote, without specifically addressing the forecast of heat-related deaths.

The finding that fossil fuels were causing the world to warm first made it to the White House at least 60 years ago, when advisers to President Lyndon Johnson warned that runaway emissions would lead to precisely the extreme events and rapid warming the planet is undergoing today. Scores of experts have denounced the current administration’s disregard for climate science, noting there is overwhelming evidence that human-driven climate change is already causing damage that will only get worse.

When Heat Becomes Deadly

The people most likely to die from rising temperatures are those already disproportionately vulnerable to extreme heat: laborers toiling outdoors; the very old; the very young, who lose fluids especially quickly; people with disabilities and illnesses; and people who lack air conditioning and stable housing.

Extremely high temperatures kill by overwhelming the body’s ability to cool itself. Sweating often ceases. Unconsciousness, organ failure and death follow. Rising temperatures also exacerbate existing health conditions, triggering heart attacks, strokes and respiratory problems that hasten death.

In recent years, climate change has caused the number of deaths from heat exposure to climb around the world. In the U.S., deaths linked to heat have increased more than 50% since 2000, according to a recent study from the Yale School of Public Health.

Hundreds of people died in the Pacific Northwest in 2021, when a high pressure system trapped hot air above parts of the area and caused temperatures to soar well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Many of the elderly victims were found alone in their homes, without air conditioning. One farmworker collapsed in a field, another in a plant nursery. A 65-year-old took her last breath in her parked car and was essentially baked by the sun. A team of climate scientists found that the heat wave would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change.

Still, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, the total number of temperature-related deaths may not appear catastrophic right away. As the planet warms in the next few decades, the global decline in people dying from cold may almost entirely offset deaths from heat. But in the second half of the century, long after Trump has left office, the number of heat-related deaths is expected to greatly outpace the reduction of deaths from cold.

While the U.S. has emitted more climate-warming pollution than any other country, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, it is expected to suffer only up to 1% of temperature-related deaths worldwide caused by the additional carbon emissions, according to a working paper by R. Daniel Bressler, an assistant economics professor at Bentley University who developed the concept of the mortality cost of carbon.

Some of the world’s poorest countries will almost certainly struggle to adapt. Niger and Somalia — whose emissions are dwarfed by those of the U.S. — are projected to have the world’s highest per capita death rates from increasing temperatures, Bressler found. India is expected to suffer more temperature-related deaths than any other country. Pakistan, which has just 3% of the world’s population, is expected to have between 6% and 7% of the world’s temperature-related deaths, depending on its ability to adapt to the effects of heat.

Projected Temperature-Related Deaths From Additional Carbon Emissions Compared to Country Population

How disproportionately countries are expected to be impacted relative to their population size.

“People in my community will die,” said Ayisha Siddiqa, a Los Angeles-based climate activist whose family continues to live in her native Pakistan.

Siddiqa, who co-founded the environmental group Future Generations Tribunal, recalled the effect of heat on her family in 2022, when temperatures in Pakistan and India soared above 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Like most people in the region, the Siddiqas do not have air conditioning. Her father, she said, lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized during the deadly heat wave.

“It’s unexplainable,” she said of the heat. “It’s kind of like the entire air around you is sticking to your body and you can’t breathe.”

Progress Reversed

At this time last year, the United States was on track to drastically reduce its emissions.

Under President Joe Biden, the nation made landmark investments to turn away from fossil fuels, the primary driver of climate change, and harness power from the wind and the sun. Hundreds of billions of dollars were being directed toward reducing emissions through a variety of initiatives, such as putting more electric vehicles on the roads and making office buildings and homes more energy efficient.

Biden also reversed Trump’s first-term decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the international deal struck a decade ago in which countries pledged to work together to limit global warming.

But as soon as he returned to the White House, Trump began to undo it all. On his first day back, in front of a crowd of cheering supporters wearing MAGA hats, he authorized the United States to again pull out of the Paris Agreement, which he previously deemed a “rip-off.” Just 10 days earlier, the World Meteorological Association had declared 2024 the hottest year on record.

Over the next 100 days, Trump instigated more efforts to roll back climate policies than he had in his entire previous term.

In March, his Environmental Protection Agency celebrated the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history” when it announced a slew of actions intended to reverse his predecessor’s efforts to rein in climate change. Among them were regulations that restrict emissions from cars and trucks, limit air pollution from oil and gas operations, and require power plants to capture planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Then came the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump’s nickname for the domestic policy megabill he signed in July. The act cut tax incentives for solar and wind energy and electric vehicles; made it easier and cheaper to drill or mine on federal lands; reversed efforts to cut emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas; and increased government support for coal.

Calculating the Lives Lost

To understand the consequences of these moves, ProPublica and the Guardian used the results of modeling from Rhodium Group, an independent, nonpartisan research firm that analyzed the policy changes from this year. The group came up with a high, low and midrange estimate of the amount of additional emissions expected to be released in the next 10 years as a result of the rollbacks the EPA announced in March and the bill passed this summer. (The modeling also reflects changes due to market forces and other factors.)

For our calculation, our starting point was Rhodium Group’s midrange number: 5.7 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions through 2035. (Using the firm’s other estimates would result in between 571,000 and nearly 2.2 million extra temperature-related deaths due to Trump’s policy changes. The Princeton University-led REPEAT Project conducted a similar analysis and came up with 6.9 billion metric tons, which would result in even more projected deaths.)

To translate those emissions to deaths, ProPublica and the Guardian turned to the field of climate economics, which links human-generated emissions to measurable economic costs. A model that calculates what’s known as the social cost of carbon by Nobel laureate William Nordhaus has been used in federal policy since 2009, guiding everything from requirements mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to EPA regulations.

While Nordhaus estimated the broad economic cost of climate change, Bressler, the Bentley University professor, used Nordhaus’ model as a starting point but focused on just temperature-related deaths. Drawing also on public health research, Bressler estimated the amount of additional carbon dioxide expected to cause one death over 80 years: 4,434 metric tons. The figure is equivalent to the average lifetime emissions of 3.5 Americans or 146.2 Nigerians. Using the same estimate, Bressler also calculated how many deaths are expected over the course of 80 years from each additional metric ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. He published his findings in Nature Communications in 2021.

In response to questions for this story, the EPA, which recently stopped considering the social cost of carbon at Trump’s direction, rejected Bressler’s scientific analysis. The agency called it “an exercise in moral posturing, not rigorous science” and said that the calculation of deaths per metric ton of carbon is “based on unvalidated extrapolations” and ignores “the dramatic uncertainties that dominate long-term climate projections.”

Climate scientists, however, said that the mortality cost of carbon is a valid metric. Peer reviewers for the 2021 paper that laid out the concept described it as “valuable and intuitive” and relevant for designing policy. After publishing the study, Bressler went on to serve as climate staff economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Others have emphasized that, because Bressler’s model focuses narrowly on the direct effects of temperature, the estimates it generates are vastly lower than the total death toll from climate change. It also does not capture the serious but non-deadly effects of extreme heat, such as reduced productivity and increased misery.

Bressler acknowledges that his work produces estimates and that the true number of additional deaths due to greenhouse gas emissions will depend on several unknowable factors, including how quickly people adapt to changing temperatures and market forces. Critically, future presidents and other countries could also upend predictions by taking new steps to reduce emissions.

Bressler’s 2021 paper previewed multiple possible futures for the planet. Under what he calls the “pessimistic” scenario, global emissions wouldn’t level off until the end of the century. It was under this scenario that Bressler estimated that, by 2100, climate change will have caused 83 million people to die of temperature-related deaths around the world. This is the scenario that would result in 1.3 million deaths by 2115 from the additional emissions released over the next 10 years as a result of Trump’s policies.

If global emissions were to drop to almost zero by 2050, the total projected toll from temperature-related deaths due to climate change would fall to 9 million by 2100. Even then, Trump’s policy changes this year alone would still result in an additional 613,000 deaths.

Experts agree that, while both of the scenarios Bressler lays out are possible, the most likely amount of emissions will fall between these two extremes. Still, Bressler said, the projections underscore what’s at stake.

“If you do things that add emissions, you cause deaths,” he said. “If you do things that reduce emissions, you save lives.”","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trump-climate-change-deaths-feature_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-11-19 12:04:40.716334

Additionally, it is expected for Stellantis to gain Supercharger access across the Tesla Supercharging network for all its EVs (currently more than 28,000 stalls across the impacted five countries — the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea).

The group has multiple brands, including Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Alfa Romeo, and Fiat.

Stellantis NACS Adoption

Stellantis originally announced in February 2024 that the switch to the NACS (SAE J3400) charging standard would begin in North America in 2025. However, as we are now in November 2025, it seems that the use of NACS charging ports instead of CCS1 will begin in 2026. Stellantis’ electrification plans appear notably delayed and scaled back in general.

Additionally, Stellantis announced the international expansion of SAE J3400 use in Japan and South Korea. That’s a smart move, as Tesla already operates NACS charging infrastructure in both markets. At the same time, it makes little to no sense to develop special versions of its EVs with a CCS1 charging port just for South Korea and with a CHAdeMO charging port, just for Japan.

In other global markets, Stellantis is expected to stick with the CCS2 charging port.

Stellantis Supercharging Access

Gaining native access to the Tesla Supercharging network is the primary reason behind the switch to the NACS (SAE J3400). According to Stellantis, its EVs will gain access to over 28,000 Tesla Supercharging stalls in North America, Japan, and South Korea.

The manufacturer says that its compatible EVs will be able to charge at thousands of Tesla Supercharging locations in North America starting in early 2026. In Japan and South Korea, access is expected in 2027.

Stellantis’ existing EVs (like the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona), equipped with the CCS1 charging port, will require a NACS-to-CCS1 adapter to access Superchargers. The upcoming 2026 Jeep Recon will most likely have a NACS charging inlet (it will need a CCS1-to-NACS adapter to access CCS1 chargers). Details about adapters and access will be shared later.

“Tesla Supercharger network availability will start in 2026 with existing North American BEVs, such as Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona, followed by the 2026 Jeep Recon and other future products.”

Overall, it’s good to see that Stellantis moves forward despite some delays. With access to the Tesla Supercharging network, DC fast-charging options significantly increase, as Tesla operates more than half of all public DC charging stalls in the US.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JP026_005RE.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:06:19.353161

This year, The Greening of Detroit is reaching a landmark 177,000 trees planted since its founding.

That’s long-term stewardship.” Greening work in Detroit also comes with real challenges.","On a fall morning, a group of residents, volunteers and Greening of Detroit staff members stand side by side on vacant block on Detroit’s east side. There are shovels, buckets, work gloves — and a sense of excitement. Each time a tree goes in the ground, it marks more than another sapling added to the city’s growing canopy. It marks an investment in the environment, the neighborhood and the people themselves. And it signals a new sense of pride and hope.

This year, The Greening of Detroit is reaching a landmark 177,000 trees planted since its founding. And for Vice President Monica Tabares, who has been with the organization for 25 years, that number carries a deeper meaning.

“It’s special to be part of an organization that transforms the landscape and lives,” she says. “Our work is immediate and enduring — you can plant trees on a block and instantly make it feel different. But what you don’t always see is the pride, skills, and confidence that also start growing.”

Founded in 1989, The Greening of Detroit began with a focused mission to reforest a city devastated by Dutch elm disease. But over time, the organization evolved into something broader — and more powerful.

“We started as a tree-planting organization, and today, we’re an urban greening and workforce development organization deeply embedded in Detroit’s neighborhoods,” Tabares explains. “We restore tree canopy, educate youth across all Detroit schools, and train residents for meaningful careers in landscaping and forestry.”

Detroit’s tree canopy currently covers about 24% of the city, well below the national average for cities and suburbs. Decades of disinvestment, industrial pollution, and the loss of ash trees have left many neighborhoods hotter, more polluted, and lacking safe green spaces.

That’s why, for Tabares, tree planting is never just about beautification.

“Trees improve air quality, reduce stormwater runoff, lower energy costs, and provide shade in areas that experience some of the worst heat,” she says. “But they’re also about community revitalization and equity. Green lots create safe, healthy spaces where people can live and thrive. It’s an investment.”

Detroit has also faced the effects of increasingly severe storms — another reason urban greenery matters.

“Trees remediate stormwater and pollution. They literally change environmental outcomes. And when you look at equity — the neighborhoods that experienced the most disinvestment historically also face the highest pollution levels. Everyone deserves access to healthy, green, outdoor spaces. It’s basic to livelihood.”

One of the most impactful parts of The Greening of Detroit’s work is its Detroit Conservation Corps, a six-week training program preparing Detroiters – including returning citizens and those with limited job history – for roles in landscaping and forestry.

“Many of our participants have faced barriers to employment,” Tabares says. “They’re looking for opportunity, and there is so much work to be done in this city. We train individuals as landscape technicians and forestry techs, and we connect them to employers. What starts as planting trees often becomes a pathway to a career.”

Just last week, the team celebrated its 71st cohort graduation.

“Several graduates stood up and said this work has changed their lives. Some never completed high school. Some didn’t think doors like this existed for them. But planting trees is a simple and rewarding act. You leave at the end of the day and there’s a forested block. And you realize you helped create it.”

Monica is especially passionate about generational learning. Her belief is that real change starts with young people.

The organization’s Tree Keepers Kids program brings environmental education directly into Detroit schools — helping students understand the purpose and benefits of trees, and how they can contribute to greener neighborhoods.

The Green Corps summer youth employment program — now 26 years old — hires teens aged 14–18 to maintain trees planted across the city.

“It’s more than a summer job,” she says. “We introduce students to career pathways and higher education opportunities in forestry, biology, soil science, conservation, fields many Black and brown students are never exposed to. We’ve had alumni go on to work for the U.S. Forest Service. That’s something we’re incredibly proud of.”

So how does The Greening of Detroit measure success?

“Yes, we track environmental impact,” Tabares says. “But what matters most is community engagement — how residents are involved in shaping their neighborhoods. And we see the social impact: people gain job skills, confidence, and pride. That pride spreads. That’s long-term stewardship.”

Greening work in Detroit also comes with real challenges.

“Our work is scalable and there is so much more we can do, but funding sometimes determines that,” she says.

But Detroit’s geography provides a unique advantage: land.

“We have an abundance of vacant lots. They’re opportunities to keep land clean and green while development plans take shape. It’s almost a blank canvas. We realize some will be developed, but until then, we can plant trees, restore soil, and create healthier spaces.”

For Tabares, this is more than a job. It’s personal.

“I’m a native Detroiter. Being part of this work keeps me very connected to the city,” she says. “For 25 years, I’ve watched blocks transform. I’ve seen residents gain skills that open doors to meaningful careers. I’ve seen young people get their first spark of curiosity and think maybe this could be their future. That keeps me passionate.”

The Greening of Detroit may be approaching 177,000 trees, but perhaps the most enduring growth is harder to count: confidence, pride, stewardship, future careers, and a city redefining what its landscape can look like.

As Tabares puts it,

“Planting trees changes the view from your window. But it also changes people — sometimes when they need it most.”",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-5.58.47-AM-1024x416.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:49.848754

Spain, which has seen its renewable energy generation capacity increase in recent years, has announced it has opened a €350 million funding round aimed directly at the wind repowering and energy storage upgrades that the nation sees as essential. The announcement was made recently by the nation’s Vice President and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagesen.

Spain has announced an eye-watering funding allocation for the renewable energy sector

Wind power is not the only sector that is set to receive funds from the government, as the government has announced a new aid package for decarbonization and competitiveness in its energy sector. The government has stated that these funds, with a combined amount of €2 billion, will be allocated to projects that boost the industrial value chain and promote the energy transition overall.

Moreover, the Spanish government has noted that several of the planned projects can be implemented after August 31, 2026, which is notably the deadline for justifying the aid received under the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan (RTRP).

“With just one month to go before the fourth anniversary of the PERTE ERHA (Strategic Plan for the Renewable Energy of the Habitat), half a million actions of all kinds have been implemented, and now we are continuing this work with this new package of measures aimed at further leveraging decarbonization to boost competitiveness.” – Spain’s Vice President and Minister for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, Sara Aagesen

The Spanish government has launched a new call for wind repowering and energy-storage upgrades

Building on the planned allocation of funds for the renewable energy sector, the Spanish government has launched a new call for proposals for the wind power sector with a €350 million funding round. The new funding round also covers the manufacturing of other equipment covered by the CISAF (Spanish Association of Energy Efficiency and Manufacturing).

“In short, this package will allow us to advance the model that has enabled us to become a benchmark for economic and environmental progress, industrial modernization, and the fight against climate change.” – Spain’s Vice President Sara Aagesen

The new funding allocation forms part of a broader initiative undertaken by the Spanish government to adapt port infrastructure to develop renewable technologies such as offshore wind power. Regardless of how you might feel about wind power, the sector has grown beyond expectations. That reality has not set in for the United States, as industry leaders have noted that the wind sector is being essentially paralyzed by the government’s permitting stagnation.

Spain is aiming to become a regional leader in the renewable energy sector, and the evidence suggests that the nation is on the right track to achieve its goals of boosting the renewable energy sector over the coming years.

Now the company has launched a new charging infrastructure planning platform specifically designed for commercial EV fleet deployments. The SparkAI platform “combines real-world intelligence, project location-specific datasets, weather forecasts, and a comprehensive global EV database to create optimized charging infrastructure plans for fleet owners and operators.”

Many, if not most, electrification projects face grid capacity limitations that can delay deployments by months or years. SparkAI analyzes specific power needs and available power sources to deliver site-specific configurations in order to help fleets deploy scalable infrastructure quickly.

SparkAI’s intelligence engine cross-analyzes live environmental and geographic data against energy demand forecasts to calculate exact power requirements per site. This can enable charging deployment in areas previously considered uneconomical for electrification, such as rural regions, congested areas, industrial zones and aging grid corridors. The platform can also design hybrid and off-grid charging systems that scale dynamically with fleet growth. SparkCharge’s mobile battery trailers and off-grid power hubs can be deployed anywhere to provide off-grid power where needed.

According to SparkCharge, SparkAI can help fleet operators reduce total infrastructure and operating costs through accurate forecasting and intelligent system sizing. By preventing both costly overbuilding and energy shortfalls, SparkAI improves asset utilization, lowers exposure to peak utility rates, and enables fleets to use off-grid or hybrid energy sources.

“SparkAI isn’t just about faster planning, it’s about smarter energy deployment,” said Joshua Aviv, founder and CEO of SparkCharge. “Right now, we’re channeling that precision into EV charging, helping fleets electrify without overloading the grid. But the bigger opportunity is optimizing how and where energy flows, for EVs and beyond. It’s a smarter grid strategy, powered by real-time intelligence.”

“SparkAI is a game-changer for infrastructure ROI,” said David Piperno, CFO of SparkCharge. “By eliminating over-provisioning and planning delays, we’re helping fleets reduce capital expenditures while accelerating deployment timelines. It’s not just about planning faster, it’s about deploying smarter and scaling profitably.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/6915e432b8876add2a4d122d_Group-11-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:59.142465

Electric utilities’ growing use of demand response programs to stabilize the power grid represents a cost- and labor-saving opportunity for building owners, particularly multifamily and hotels, according to a whitepaper released last month.

In demand response programs, utilities give building operators an incentive to reduce energy use during peak load periods. Buildings can significantly reduce the labor burden of participating in the programs by automating their systems, HVAC optimization company Parity said in the report.

By enabling seamless demand response participation, HVAC automation can meaningfully cut buildings’ electricity costs at a time when utility rate increases are outpacing the rate of inflation, Parity said. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects retail electricity prices to rise 13% from 2022 to 2025.

Dive Insight:

Parity’s report lays out a road map for property owners to transform their facilities into “grid-interactive efficient buildings” that are better positioned to use energy more efficiently and make it easier for operators to participate in utility demand response programs.

Technologies that support grid-interactive efficient buildings — occupancy-sensing lighting and HVAC controls, for example — are increasingly common in offices and other types of commercial buildings, Parity said. In multifamily buildings and hotels, the same tools can reduce lighting waste, HVAC load and other power uses in common areas and rooms.

Utility-led demand response programs have historically involved blunt measures like remotely cutting off service to energy-intensive HVAC systems, or less reliable alternatives like asking facility managers to turn down or deactivate equipment. Those requests may not come until a few hours before an event is scheduled to start, if not closer, Parity said.

That picture is changing as utilities move toward more sophisticated programs that leverage virtual power plants, or VPP, which supporters say could reduce peak electric load nationwide by 10% to 20% within a few years. As data centers and building HVAC electrification boost demand for electricity, demand response and VPP programs are among the fastest, lowest-cost options for adding capacity to the grid, enabling the generation of new capacity in a matter of months rather than the several years it takes to build a gas-fired power plant.

Automated HVAC controls improve virtual power plants’ reliability by ensuring that the systems respond when the utility needs them to. That’s especially important for thinly staffed hotels and multifamily buildings whose onsite operations and maintenance personnel often lack the technical skills to fine-tune HVAC or building management systems, or who are reluctant to compromise guests’ comfort, Parity said.

More sophisticated solutions like remote HVAC optimization services, a space Parity competes in, can reduce onsite workloads by 80% to 90% during demand response, the company says. These solutions are also more effective at shifting HVAC power loads while maintaining comfort, such as by pre-cooling interiors in the morning before scheduled demand response events in the afternoon and evening, Parity says.

“Automating demand response turns what was once a reactive, manual process into a seamless, high-value capability,” Brad Pilgrim, CEO and co-founder of Parity, said in a statement.

It fuels businesses, supports families, and gives communities the foundation to grow.

Nowhere is that clearer than in South Carolina, where record population growth and major industrial expansion are pushing electricity demand to unprecedented levels.

Yet many projects that could expand supply and strengthen the grid are stuck waiting on approvals that take years to complete.

These delays stem largely from federal reviews that move far slower than the needs of fast-growing states like South Carolina.

The longer they wait, the higher costs climb for everyone.

The issue is not a lack of investment or ingenuity. South Carolina has become a national magnet for advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle production, aerospace suppliers, and next-generation logistics.

BMW’s continued growth in Spartanburg, Bosch’s battery component expansion, new industrial parks in Greer, Gaffney, and Laurens County, and a wave of suppliers serving Siemens and GE Vernova all depend on a modern, reliable grid.

But the bureaucratic process that governs the infrastructure needed to power these projects, transmission lines, substation upgrades, and grid interconnections moves too slowly and has become overly complex.

Developers often face overlapping reviews, shifting requirements, and legal challenges that can drag on for years.

The 732-mile TransWest Express transmission line from Wyoming to Nevada, for example, took nearly 18 years just to secure permits before breaking ground.

Duke Energy shuffles costs to make proposed Carolinas merger more attractive to SC

To support BMW expansions, battery component suppliers, and new industrial development corridors along the Interstate 85 spine, Duke Energy needs timely approvals for new substations, high-voltage transmission lines, and large-scale grid upgrades that often take longer to permit than to construct.

When these projects stall, reliability and affordability for families and businesses are put at risk.

When projects take too long to build, communities lose out on affordable power, new jobs, and private investment.

According to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, as much as $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment nationwide is tied up in the federal permitting process. A meaningful share of that investment is aimed at fast-growing states like South Carolina — if the infrastructure can actually be built.

Permitting reform is about restoring common sense. It means keeping environmental standards strong while making the approval process clear, efficient, and predictable.

The goal is not to cut corners, but to cut confusion.

That can be done by establishing firm timelines so projects can move from proposal to construction without endless waiting; designating a single coordinating agency to avoid duplicative reviews; prioritizing high-impact projects such as Upstate transmission upgrades; and creating a clear judicial review process so infrastructure that meets every requirement is not stuck in court for years.

Streamlining the process would save time and money without weakening safeguards. Federal reforms are especially important because many transmission projects require approvals from

multiple federal agencies before South Carolina utilities can even begin construction.

Today, a routine transmission line needed to power a new industrial supplier in Spartanburg County can take years longer to approve than to build. Substation upgrades serving fast-growing communities around Greer, Powdersville, and the western Upstate must often navigate multilayered reviews that move more slowly than the growth they are intended to support.

With targeted reforms, builders could move forward with confidence, and communities would benefit from lower costs and greater reliability as new energy sources and delivery systems come online sooner.

Permitting reform also strengthens America’s energy independence, and South Carolina’s competitiveness.

Much of the region’s electric grid is operating with equipment deep into the second half of its lifespan, even as demand accelerates. Federal energy analyses show that the United States will need to double the size of its electric grid by mid-century to support artificial intelligence, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and population growth, all trends already reshaping South Carolina.

When infrastructure can be built faster, energy becomes more affordable and more secure. Local industries, from battery manufacturing in the Midlands to aerospace and advanced-materials

suppliers across the Upstate, can expand with confidence.

And new employers deciding where to invest will see a state prepared for continued growth, not constrained by outdated processes.

Modernizing how projects are approved is not a partisan issue. It is a practical step toward a stronger economy and a more resilient energy system. Families deserve affordable electricity and

reliable service, and they deserve a government that helps make that possible.

The time to act is now. Modernizing the federal permitting process will lower costs, strengthen reliability, and keep energy affordable for every family and business in South Carolina.

The real test is whether society can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers —and simultaneously improve emissions intensity throughout the energy system.
Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most.
Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources — and robust domestic energy supply — planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging.","Here’s a fundamental truth: There is no AI without energy. And as the technology grows, its demand for energy and carbon footprint may never again be as small as they are today.

Against this backdrop, debates over which energy source should power AI miss the point. AI’s appetite for energy — relative to what the grid has available today — will demand every tool available. Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation. The real test is whether society can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers —and simultaneously improve emissions intensity throughout the energy system.

Governments and market participants are focused on how best to balance these considerations at a pace that will support America’s competitive advantages.

The U.S. will need new chip factories, new data centers and — most critically — vast new sources of energy, along with the infrastructure to deliver it where it’s needed. Recent reforms outlined in Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan aim to accelerate permitting and expedite infrastructure deployment, with the recognition that tomorrow’s energy system will look very different from the one we have today.

Bridging policy ambition with practical delivery requires companies capable of moving energy at scale, making infrastructure essential to the task. Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most. Its assets are strategically linked to major population hubs and positioned near the fast-growing data center clusters that will anchor the digital economy.

Being able to move the energy is only one part of the need. A diverse portfolio of energy businesses and capabilities — from natural gas transmission and storage to gas utilities and renewable power operations — is crucial to deliver a mix of energy sources that support clean energy ambitions while ensuring continuous baseload power.

Here’s what that looks like in action: Earlier this year, Enbridge announced that it is developing and will be operating a 600-megawatt solar project near San Antonio, providing renewable power for a customer.

On the Gulf Coast, advanced optimization projects — including a $50-million expansion of the Southeast Supply Header pipeline across Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama — are meeting the growing power needs of a major electric utility serving data centers.

There’s also the expansion of the Texas Eastern Transmission system to support the Homer City Redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania. Once fully operational, this will be the largest natural gas-fired power plant in the U.S. dedicated entirely to data centers and AI.

This mix of energy sources and innovation will help to match immediate energy needs with long-term growth projections.

Enbridge’s approach to the energy evolution must include:

Lowering the emissions intensity of operations

Helping customers transition from higher-emitting fuels to lower-carbon options

Building more efficient and lower-carbon infrastructure

Since 2020, Enbridge has reduced greenhouse gas emissions intensity from its operations by 40 percent.

Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources — and robust domestic energy supply — planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging. Google recently offered data that punctuates this point: A median prompt to its Gemini model consumes 0.24 watt-hours — about the same as running a laptop for 17 seconds or a microwave for one second.

In June, Sam Altman noted in a blog post on AI’s growth that the average ChatGPT query consumes about 0.34 watt-hours of electricity, roughly what a high-efficiency light bulb uses in a couple of minutes.

Numbers like these sharpen public understanding of AI’s energy appetite, but they also expose Jevons paradox — the dynamic in which gains in efficiency lower costs, only to spark even greater demand.

For energy providers, that means data-driven planning and experience will be essential. Data centers will need partners that can deliver capacity, reliability and sustainability — from baseload natural gas to renewables, storage and infrastructure built to meet real demand and support round-the-clock operations.

The paradox also makes clear what’s at stake: As AI expands, innovation will rise or fall on the availability and deliverability of dependable, flexible energy systems.

Meeting this moment will require unprecedented coordination among policymakers, hyperscalers and energy providers.",https://static.politico.com/1e/86/969ad8ff454cbc6d5157cc895994/enbridge-header.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 13:03:00.287538

Campbell power plant in Michigan to operate for an additional 90 days past its original planned retirement date, until February 17, 2026, bringing the total extension to 270 days from when the plant was supposed to shut down. This is the third order issued for the Campbell plant – the Department of Energy first ordered it to remain online past its planned retirement in May and extended it again on August 20.

Consumers Energy committed to retire the plant in 2022 under a settlement approved by Michigan state regulators, finding that replacing the plant with a variety of cleaner resources – including wind, solar, and storage – would reduce costs for Michigan customers. DOE’s series of emergency orders ignore those decisions and are now putting consumers across the Midwest on the hook to keep this aging, expensive, and highly-polluting plant online. According to financial filings from Consumers Energy, the emergency orders have caused the coal plant to rack up over $80 million in losses as of September 30 – over $600,000 a day – which are continuing to accumulate. Those costs will be recovered from millions of families and businesses in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

“Mandating aging, unreliable and costly coal plants to stay open past their retirement is a guaranteed way to needlessly hike up Americans’ electricity bills and make air pollution worse,” saidTed Kelly, Director and Lead Counsel for U.S. Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund. “The barely working Campbell plant, which has burned through over $600,000 in losses every day under DOE’s unlawful orders, proves that this is a failed strategy for our country’s growing electricity needs.

“These half-a-century old plants are simply too expensive to operate, too dangerous for our health and break down too often to be counted on. To keep costs down, we should be unleashing – not blocking – the cheapest, fastest and cleanest sources of electricity onto our grid, including solar, wind and battery projects.

“EDF and allies will continue to fight these illegal and completely unnecessary emergency orders in court.”

Despite claims from the Trump administration that coal is “reliable,” data from North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) shows that coal experiences the most outages from equipment failures of any power source in the U.S.

Case in point: In June, the Campbell plant partially broke down when DOE claimed it was important for maintaining reliability. Only one unit was even producing power because another unit had been broken for weeks and the third abruptly shut off.

The regional grid operator (MISO) had a surplus of resources greater than ten times the power provided by Campbell because the grid operator and utility were prepared for its retirement. Moreover, NERC’s latest annual winter reliability assessment, also released yesterday, concluded that MISO has sufficient resources to meet electricity needs even in situations with extreme levels of demand and generator outages.",https://www.edf.org/themes/edf2020/favicons/favicon-96x96.png,N,,2025-11-19 11:05:04.020758

DALLAS, TEXAS (November 19, 2025) – Monday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin shared 100 additional environmental accomplishments EPA has achieved in the last 100 days, recognizing 300 days of fulfilling the agency’s statutory obligations, and delivering clean air, land, and water for all Americans under President Donald Trump's leadership.

EPA Region 6 led the response to the Smitty’s Supply fire in Roseland, Louisiana, to remove over 11 million gallons of waste from the Tangipahoa River and surrounding waterways and engage with over 3,000 residents. Region 6 also issued a Safe Drinking Water Act permit for ExxonMobil’s Rose Low Carbon Solutions Class VI injection wells in Jefferson County and a Clean Air Act permit to Texas GulfLink for a deepwater port southeast of Freeport. These permits enable significant projects to move forward, creating jobs and boosting the nation’s energy economy. Region 6 also provided oversight of the depressurization of four flanged tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Air monitoring for tritium indicated no deviation from background levels.

Nationwide, this progress includes announcing a proposed rule that establishes a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), completing 100 days of ""pressure testing"" Tijuana-San Diego wastewater projects from the July 2025 U.S.-Mexico Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and accelerating timelines by nine months, secured our border from dangerous illegal pesticides through enforcement action, led emergency response efforts and cleanup efforts in communities across the nation, and so much more.

These 100 actions build on Administrator Zeldin’s list of 100 pro-environmental actions taken by the agency during President Trump’s First 100 Days in office and another 100 pro-environmental actions highlighted at the 200-day milestone to total 300 featured accomplishments.

""We are thrilled to announce another 100 top accomplishments from the last 100 days in our mission to meet our statutory duties and defend human health and environmental quality,"" said EPA Administrator Zeldin. ""The Trump EPA is showing that we can be exceptional environmental stewards while Powering the Great American Comeback. 300 days, 300 major environmental wins – this is the energy that propels us forward and the pace that motivates us. We will keep working tirelessly to secure success after success for America's environment and families nationwide.""

“EPA Region 6 is home to much of our nation’s energy, industry, and agriculture production as well as diverse landscapes and natural resources. Under the Trump Administration, our team has shown we can fulfill our mission to protect human health and the environment while not getting in the way of the economic development that’s Powering the Great American Comeback,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “We have accomplished a great deal in less than a year, and we’ll keep pushing to do even more for the environment, the economy, and the American people.”

This snapshot represents the great work done by the agency on a daily basis as EPA continues to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment, while committing to commonsense policies that drive down prices, unleash American energy, advance permitting reform and cooperative federalism, make America the AI capital of the world, and revitalize the auto industry.

Led emergency response at Smitty’s Supply explosion and fire in Louisiana deploying 464 EPA employees and contractors to conduct air monitoring and recover 7,622,181 gallons of oily waste and 3,769,668 gallons of CERCLA waste from the Tangipahoa River.

Delivered as part of a US$10 billion five-year investment plan announced on 12 November, this latest funding boost will create 252 new jobs, according to Toyota. The investment will, it said, increase hybrid capacity and bring hybrid-electric Corollas to its production lineup.

The latest investment is split between Toyota’s plants in West Virginia (US$453 million), Kentucky (US$204.4 million), Mississippi (US$125 million), Tennessee (US$71.4 million) and Missouri (US$57.1 million).

The Mississippi plant will begin the first assembly of an electrified Corolla model in the US. Other plants will increase or begin production of parts for hybrid vehicles including transaxles and engine blocks.

Toyota currently assembles about half of the vehicles it sells globally in the US, with facilities in the country assembling 76% of its vehicles sold in the US market. It does import some core components of its hybrid vehicles to the US from its Japanese facilities, though the proportion of those is not disclosed.

Toyota has also launched operations at its US$13.9 billion North Carolina EV battery facility, marking the company’s first battery manufacturing plant outside of Japan.

Its North Carolina plant will produce up to 30GWh annually at full capacity and produce lithium-ion batteries for its portfolio of its electrified vehicles—including hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and all electric vehicles.

The company said its ‘multi-pathway powertrain’ approach is driving growth in electrified vehicles, which account for just under half of its US sales.

There is room for some to speculate that the move to increase manufacturing capacity in the US is a means of reducing cost in response to the trade tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump.

Toyota’s senior vice president of manufacturing operations Kevin Voelkel said customers are embracing the carmaker’s hybrid vehicles, and the manufacturing teams “are gearing up to meet that growing demand”.

“Toyota’s philosophy is to build where we sell, and by adding more American jobs and investing across our U.S. footprint, we continue to stay true to that philosophy,” Voelkel said.

Hybrid EVs and the electrification of transport

HEVs and PHEVs are generally regarded as a softer way to transition to cleaner transport—the inclusion of the technology in several nations’ transport decarbonisation legislation in part represents this.

However, it also represents carmakers’ reluctance to completely retool manufacturing plants within the timeframes set for transport emissions reductions.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blt135d7077816ed9ea/691dd5b7e4a3b00e860503ca/Hybrid-Investment-2025_Hero-Image.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-19 11:03:28.875354

Covid-19 Scenario:

The outbreak of COVID-19 had a negative effect on the global electric vehicle solid state battery market, as it disrupted the entire global automotive supply chain.

At the same time, the demand for electric vehicles decreased drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The biggest issues the automotive industry faced because of COVID-19 included a limited supply of auto parts, a decline in new car sales, the closure of manufacturing plants, and a loss of working capital.

However, in the post-pandemic period, significant market players funded the creation of solid-state batteries to address problems with batteries like thermal performance and discharge rate, among others. For instance, the American company QuantumScape has developed solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles.

Leaders from Europe, Australia and Canada, making ever-larger climate promises with ever-emptier rhetoric, ignore the crucial reality that Western actions are no longer central to solving climate change.

It’s time they recognize that real progress depends on innovation, not increasingly costly restrictions.

For decades, Western governments have made carbon cuts their mission.

They’ve spent trillions pushing electric cars and unreliable wind and solar energy, but their pricey programs are barely making a dent.

The global decarbonization rate has stayed roughly constant since the 1960s.

The 2015 Paris Agreement brought no improvement — in fact, global emissions hit a new record high in 2024.

Despite this, climate campaigners unrealistically demand the world quadruple its decarbonization rate.

Why are emissions still rising, even though the EU and US spent more than $700 billion in 2024 on green investments?

Because rich-world emissions now matter less than ever before.

While the West dominated carbon emissions in the past, future emissions will overwhelmingly come from China, India, Africa, Brazil, Indonesia and other countries clambering out of poverty.

One recent scenario shows that with current policies, just 13% of CO₂ emissions for the rest of this century will come from OECD countries.

So the liberal West’s net-zero pledge for 2050 will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars, but deliver little.

Most likely, these policies will simply push energy-intensive industries to the rest of the world — as electric-car-battery manufacturing has already shifted to China’s coal-powered economy.

The EU’s coming carbon border taxes, which will slap extra fees on imported high-emission goods, will only escalate costs further for both rich and poor countries.

Even if the West managed to eliminate all its emissions by 2050, the impact on global temperatures would be tiny: a 0.04°F reduction by 2050 and less than 0.2°F by 2100, according to the UN’s climate model.

Despite this limited relevance, climate summits and activists fixate on what the rich world should do.

Protesters glue themselves to highways in Europe and the United States while largely ignoring China and disregarding India, Africa and the rest of the developing world.

Small wonder: Their message of self-sacrifice holds no appeal in countries that urgently need affordable energy for development.

Poorer nations are not looking to emulate Germany’s climate-driven debt, Spain’s green blackouts or the UK’s record electricity prices.

There is a cheaper and far more promising alternative: innovation.

Throughout history, humanity has overcome major challenges not by restricting growth, but by inventing better solutions.

When smog choked Los Angeles in the 1950s, we didn’t ban cars; we created the catalytic converter.

When much of the world faced hunger in the 1960s, we didn’t mandate rationing; we developed higher-yield crops.

We now need similar breakthroughs in green energy — yet innovation is precisely what the world is neglecting.

In 1980, after the oil shocks, rich countries spent more than 8 cents of every $100 of GDP on green R&D to find energy alternatives.

But as fossil fuels became cheaper, that investment dropped — and when climate concerns rose, governments funneled funds into subsidizing inefficient wind and solar rather than boosting innovation.

By 2023, the rich world spent less than 4 cents per $100 of GDP — just $27 billion, under 2% of all green spending — on research.

This must change. The West should increase green-energy R&D to around $100 billion a year.

That relatively modest investment could potentially enable breakthroughs across a broad range of technologies: fourth-generation nuclear, scalable green hydrogen and water purification, next-generation batteries, CO₂-free oil harvested from algae, carbon capture, fusion, advanced biofuels and many others.

None of these promising technologies is efficient — yet — but innovation only needs to make one or a few of them a better deal than fossil fuels.

Once that happens, every nation will adopt them: Innovation promises a global solution, whereas Western emissions cuts barely register.

Crucially, innovation costs only a tiny fraction of what today’s net-zero plans demand.

Instead of pouring resources into subsidies and mandates that raise prices and shift emissions abroad, we could spend comparatively little to make clean energy inherently competitive.

Yet the climate-obsessed politicians from Europe, Canada and Australia negotiating in Belém remain blind to the necessity of green R&D.

President Donald Trump didn’t show up at COP30, or even send a representative.

Instead, his administration should step forward to lead the charge on pragmatic energy policies.

His practical influence could rally others toward an affordable path that’s far smarter than pouring billions into symbolic gestures that barely move the needle.

It’s time for the West to recognize its limitations — and pivot from wasteful spending to game-changing tech investments that actually deliver results.

Hill",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/environmental-law/1707214/texas-granted-primacy-over-class-vi-wells-streamlining-carbon-capture-and-storage-permitting,"Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state.
Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota.
The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards.
Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S.
With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Nov. 12, 2025, announced a final rule granting the State of Texas primary implementation and enforcement authority (also known as primacy) for Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signed the pre-publication version of the final rule on behalf of the agency.

This important decision supports cooperative federalism goals by transferring the sole authority for permitting wells used for geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration from the EPA to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC). Primacy is viewed as a critical step toward streamlining and significantly accelerating the permitting process for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects across the state. Texas is now the sixth state to receive primacy for its Class VI UIC program from EPA, joining Arizona, West Virginia, Louisiana, Wyoming and North Dakota. The final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, which is expected at any time.

As analyzed in Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""The Path to Class VI Primacy in Texas: MOA Reveals State and Federal Review,"" the EPA and RRC established a memorandum of agreement detailing how application reviews would be coordinated during the transition, as well as how EPA will provide oversight to the RRC. The EPA will conduct regular reviews of the RRC's Class VI UIC program to ensure that it is effective and continues to meet or exceed federal standards. Accordingly, the EPA will maintain a seat beside the RRC in a role of programmatic review.

Texas' Class VI UIC primacy solidifies its position as a leader for the development of the CCS industry in the U.S. This grant of primacy to the RRC is anticipated to reduce ""red tape"" and delays associated with federal EPA review, which can take years to complete following an already lengthy application process due to the engineering and geologic complexity of Class VI UIC wells and the CCS projects they support.

Unlike other similar agencies in other states, the RRC seems uniquely well positioned to follow through on this promise, as it can leverage its extensive experience in permitting other wells (including all types of UIC wells) and deep staff experience to provide a more efficient and predictable regulatory framework. As of Nov. 12, 2025, the RRC has 18 applicants currently under review and anticipates additional applications in the coming weeks. In its accompanying press release, the RRC remains laser focused in support its new Class VI UIC program, noting that primacy will ""provide certainty for energy companies looking to invest in CCS development.""

Next Steps

For energy companies and investors in the CCS space, this development presents a significant opportunity, given Texas' favorable geologic conditions. If CCS projects can be supported by a streamlined and predictable permitting timeline, project risk can be reduced, thereby supporting viability. Companies now have multiple opportunities to ensure that these new primacy considerations are embedded into and support their CCS projects in Texas. Those planning projects should consider engaging with counsel to understand the nuances of the new RRC-specific requirements, as well as help navigate any subsequent challenges to the Texas primacy rule. Similarly, those already holding federal Class VI UIC permits should consider risks and opportunities associated with the process of transfer from EPA to RRC jurisdiction.

In addition, companies should consider the benefits of engaging in the RRC's process at the earliest feasible date to ensure that permit applications receive the most favorable slot in the queue for RRC review. With the regulatory landscape for Class VI UIC in Texas firming up, the implementation of commercial-scale CO2 storage in the state is expected to accelerate.

Some Wisconsin utilities do offer their own community solar programs.
That means legislation is necessary to specify that other companies are also allowed to generate and sell power from community solar.
Minnesota utility Xcel Energy, for example, supported terminating the state’s community solar program during an unsuccessful effort by some lawmakers last summer to end it.
The Wisconsin bill would also require utilities to buy power from community solar arrays that don’t have enough subscribers.","On a dry, rocky patch of his family’s farm in Door County, Wisconsin, Dave Klevesahl grows wildflowers. But he has a vision for how to squeeze more value out of the plot: lease it to a company that wants to build a community solar array.

Unfortunately for Klevesahl, that is unlikely to happen under current state law. In Wisconsin, only utilities are allowed to develop such shared solar installations, which let households and businesses that can’t put panels on their own property access renewable energy via subscriptions.

Farmers, solar advocates, and legislators from both parties are trying to remove these restrictions through Senate Bill 559, which would allow the limited development of community solar by entities other than utilities.

Wisconsin lawmakers considered similar proposals in the 2021–2022 and 2023–2024 legislative sessions, with support from trade groups representing real estate agents, farmers, grocers, and retailers. But those bipartisan efforts failed in the face of opposition from the state’s powerful utilities and labor unions.

Community solar supporters are hoping for a different outcome this legislative session, which ends in March. But while the new bill, introduced Oct. 24, includes changes meant to placate utilities, the companies still firmly oppose it.

“I don’t really understand why anybody wouldn’t want community solar,” said Klevesahl, whose wife’s family has been farming their land for generations. In addition to leasing his land for an installation, he would like to subscribe to community solar, which typically saves participants money on their energy bills.

Some Wisconsin utilities do offer their own community solar programs. But they are too small to meet the demand for community solar, advocates say.

Utilities push back on shared solar

Around 20 states and Washington, D.C., have community solar programs that allow non-utility ownership of arrays. The majority of those states, including Wisconsin’s neighbor Illinois, have deregulated energy markets, in which the utilities that distribute electricity do not generate it.

In states with ​“vertically integrated” energy markets, like Wisconsin, utilities serve as regulated monopolies, both generating and distributing power. That means legislation is necessary to specify that other companies are also allowed to generate and sell power from community solar. Some vertically integrated states, including Minnesota, have passed such laws.

But monopoly utilities in those jurisdictions have consistently opposed community solar developed by third parties. Minnesota utility Xcel Energy, for example, supported terminating the state’s community solar program during an unsuccessful effort by some lawmakers last summer to end it.

The Wisconsin utilities We Energies and Madison Gas and Electric, according to their spokespeople, are concerned that customers who don’t subscribe to community solar will end up subsidizing costs for those who do. The utilities argue that because community solar subscribers have lower energy bills, they contribute less money for grid maintenance and construction, meaning that other customers must pay more to make up the difference. Clean-energy advocates, for their part, say this ​“cost shift” argument ignores research showing that the systemwide benefits of distributed energy like community solar can outweigh the expense.

The Wisconsin bill would also require utilities to buy power from community solar arrays that don’t have enough subscribers.

“This bill is being marketed as a ​‘fair’ solution to advance renewables. It’s the opposite,” said We Energies spokesperson Brendan Conway. ​“It would force our customers to pay higher electricity costs by having them subsidize developers who want profit from a no-risk solar project. Under this bill, the developers avoid any risk. The costs of their projects will shift to and be paid for by all of our ​‘non-subscribing’ customers.”

The power generated by community solar ultimately goes onto the utility’s grid, reducing the amount of electricity the utility needs to provide. But Conway said it’s not the most efficient way to meet overall demand.

“These projects would not be something we would plan for or need, so our customers would be paying for unneeded energy that benefits a very few,” he said. ​“Also, these credits are guaranteed by our other customers even if solar costs drop or grid needs change.”

Advocates in Wisconsin hope they can address such concerns and convince utilities to support community solar owned by third parties.

Beata Wierzba, government affairs director of the clean-power advocacy organization Renew Wisconsin, said her group and others ​“had an opportunity to talk with the utilities over the course of several months, trying to negotiate some language they could live with.”

“There were some exchanges where utilities gave us a dozen things that were problematic for them, and the coalition addressed them by making changes to the draft” of the bill, Wierzba said.

The spokespeople for We Energies and Madison Gas and Electric did not respond to questions about such conversations.

A small-scale start

To assuage utilities’ concerns, the bill allows third-party companies to build community solar only for the next decade. The legislation also sets a statewide cap for community solar of 1.75 gigawatts, with limits for each of the five major investor-owned utilities’ territories proportionate to each utility’s total number of customers.

Community solar arrays would be limited to 5 megawatts, with exceptions for rooftops, brownfields, and other industrial sites, where 20 megawatts can be built.

No subscriber would be allowed to buy more than 40% of the output from a single community solar array, and 60% of the subscriptions must be for 40 kilowatts of capacity or less, the bill says. This is meant to prevent one large customer — like a big-box store or factory — from buying the majority of the power and excluding others from taking advantage of the limited community solar capacity.

Customers who subscribe to community solar would still have to pay at least $20 a month to their utility for service. The bill also contains what Wierzba called an ​“off-ramp”: After four years, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin would study how the program is working and submit a report to the legislature, which could pass a new law to address any problems.

“The bill is almost like a small pilot project — it’s not like you’re opening the door and letting everyone come in,” said Wierzba. ​“You have a limit on how it can function, how many people can sign up.”

Broad support for community solar

In Wisconsin, as in other states, developers hoping to build utility-scale solar farms on agricultural land face serious pushback. The Trump administration canceled federal incentives for solar arrays on farms this summer, with U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announcing, ​“USDA will no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland.”

But Wisconsin farmers have argued that community solar can actually help keep agricultural land in production by providing an extra source of revenue. The Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation has yet to weigh in on this year’s bill, but it supported previously proposed community solar legislation.

The bill calls for state regulators to come up with rules for community solar developers that would likely require dual use — meaning that crops or pollinator habitats are planted under and around the panels or that animals graze on the land. These increasingly common practices are known as agrivoltaics.

Utility-scale solar farms, by contrast, are permitted at the state level, which can leave ​“locals feeling like they are not in control of their future,” said Matt Hargarten, vice president of government and public affairs for the Coalition for Community Solar Access. ​“This offers an alternative that is really welcome. If a town doesn’t want this to be there, it won’t be there.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Solar-panels-in-Wisconsin.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0e21115777ec63187ddd7bbbb6ec8196,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:23.208978

EPB was able to switch the neighborhood over to battery power for about half an hour until the job was done.

So it won’t be able to help with local reliability in Chattanooga, the way that the community batteries do.","Due north of Chattanooga, a power line runs through a wooded tract called Sale Creek before it dead-ends at the Tennessee River. On Oct. 8, this line lost power. But the lights stayed on for nearly 400 customers because Sale Creek has a new tool to neutralize outages.

Chattanooga’s municipal utility, EPB, had installed a Tesla Megapack battery system on this lonely stretch of the distribution grid back in June. If anything knocked out the line, residents would have 2.5 megawatts/​10 megawatt-hours of storage capacity at their disposal while crews fixed the problem.

In this case, utility workers unexpectedly needed to de-energize the line to finish making repairs. EPB was able to switch the neighborhood over to battery power for about half an hour until the job was done. Without the battery, EPB would have had to tell its customers it was cutting off their power on purpose.

“This was the first time we used it in an outage situation,” said Ryan Keel, president of the energy and communications business unit at EPB. ​“In the future, it’ll be even more unplanned. It’ll be a response to a tree falling through the line or a car hitting a pole or something.”

EPB, which serves some 500,000 people across 600 square miles, plans to roll out more targeted, resilience-oriented batteries to other outage-prone stretches of its grid. The nonprofit public power company currently has a 45-megawatt fleet of batteries, almost all of which were built this year. Besides keeping the lights on, they save money for the whole customer base by lowering the utility’s peak electricity consumption.

The United States is racing toward yet another record year of grid battery construction, as power companies tap lithium-ion batteries to store solar power, improve grid reliability, and free up capacity for new data centers. Most of these batteries are getting installed in California and Texas, where they’ve pushed down wholesale prices and banished heat wave–induced power shortages. Utilities elsewhere, though, too often bide their time in exhaustive studies of the technology, which is new by their standards, despite its mass deployment in some regions.

But batteries are starting to catch on in Tennessee: The Tennessee Valley Authority, the federal entity that generates electricity for EPB and scores of other local power companies, just committed to build 1.5 gigawatts of grid batteries across its territory by the close of 2029, its largest battery deployment by far. The TVA board approved this in its November meeting, setting the stage for the utility to solicit competitive bids from battery developers, spokesperson Scott Fiedler told Canary Media.

And although Chattanooga’s battery buildout is far smaller than what’s happening farther west, or even the installations planned by TVA, it shows how a responsive local utility can adopt new clean-energy technology to make life a little better for its customers. It doesn’t take a massive R&D budget or piles of cash from Wall Street shareholders — just a willingness to embrace a readily available technology.

Rolling blackouts prompt battery buildout

EPB had explored batteries for years. It researched them with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, located 100 miles northeast of Chattanooga. But EPB moved beyond research and installed a solar-and-battery microgrid at the Chattanooga Airport, learning how to work with the technology in practice.

Building on that experience, EPB leaders took a new look at batteries after Winter Storm Elliott rocked the region just before Christmas 2022, leaving TVA short on supply as households cranked their electric heating. For the first time since its founding in 1933, the TVA had to cut power to its customers in order to avoid damaging the grid infrastructure. So it told local power companies that they had to reduce demand by a certain amount.

“That event shaped our strategy,” Keel said. ​“We want to deploy a large amount [of batteries], because it gives us some local insulation from what may be happening on the TVA system that could impact our customers.”

Homes in TVA’s territory use a lot of electric heating and cooling, which drives grid peaks in both winter and summer. Typical hot summer and cold winter peaks for EPB reach 1,200 megawatts of demand, Keel said, but the utility set a demand record above 1,300 megawatts this January.

That means the current battery fleet meets just a small percentage of the total peak demand — enough to help on the margins, but pretty limited in its impact. Keel said his strategy is to raise that capacity to around 150 megawatts.

“Our hope is that if TVA calls for a 10% required reduction of our load, we can achieve that completely with the battery systems that we’ve put in, and we don’t need to do any unplanned outages to customers at all, like we had to” during Winter Storm Elliott, Keel said.

That battery strategy is akin to an insurance policy, responding to the concerning frequency of polar vortices and extreme heat in recent years. But the batteries don’t just sit around waiting for record cold snaps or heat waves. When the batteries aren’t acting as local backup, EPB puts them to work to save money for all customers.

When EPB buys power from TVA, it pays a demand charge for the hour of highest consumption each month. By discharging the batteries when it looks like a peak hour is approaching, EPB can shave its monthly charge. That lowers the rates it pays to TVA, which puts downward pressure on utility bills for Chattanooga residents.

“We make our decisions based on community benefit,” said J. Ed. Marston, EPB’s vice president for strategic communication. ​“The more we can keep our costs down operationally, the more we can avoid having to do electric rate increases that impact our customers.”

This dynamic parallels the way Vermont utility Green Mountain Power pays for a program that helps customers install home batteries: The utility dispatches all the small-scale batteries to reduce its peak-demand charges to the New England grid operator.

EPB expects to get payback on its battery installations within five years from the reliability and peak-demand uses. The utility has elected not to run the batteries on a daily basis, because the wear and tear that frequent cycling puts on batteries offsets the benefit of short-term savings on energy charges. (TVA territory doesn’t have wholesale markets that let batteries bid in for various services to make money.)

Chattanooga’s history of early tech adoption

EPB’s battery buildout puts it ahead of many bigger peers, in both absolute and relative terms.

It’s part of a pattern of the municipal utility embracing new technology to help its residents.

Perhaps most strikingly, the nonprofit installed fiber internet in city homes in 2009, before for-profit telecom providers were widely offering it. EPB became the first company to sell gig-speed internet to an entire community network, Keel said. (Current monthly rate for 1-gig Wi-Fi: an envy-inducing $67.99.)

That fiber also improves the efficiency of the electric grid: EPB piggybacked on the fiber to upgrade its grid network to advanced metering infrastructure, which sends real-time information to the utility and allows it to respond instantly to issues. EPB won accolades for the number of ​“smart grid” automated devices on its high-voltage distribution system per mile or per customer, Keel said.

“EPB has been incredibly impressive and forward-thinking and on the leading edge — sometimes maybe even on the bleeding edge — of technology innovation, all in the spirit of working for the benefit of their customers,” said Matt Brown, regional vice president for the Tennessee Valley at Silicon Ranch, the major solar developer based in Nashville.

Silicon Ranch is working with EPB on a different kind of money-saving clean-energy project. A large-scale solar project in West Tennessee will produce 33 megawatts for EPB as part of TVA’s Generation Flexibility program, which lets local power companies generate up to 5% of their annual demand. The project is slated to be operating by mid-2028.

That solar development will be located outside EPB’s territory, where there’s more land available. So it won’t be able to help with local reliability in Chattanooga, the way that the community batteries do. But it will generate power at cheaper rates than those of TVA, which itself has cheaper rates than most U.S. utilities, meaning that EPB can pass those savings to its customers.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/2025.10.17-Sale-Creek-Energy-Storage-Installation_2025-11-19-140856_gxyj.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=9ec49ed699f2ae5d755a2b863e7b3b00,N,,2025-11-19 14:03:08.022908

States can make climate change-fueled disasters less damaging, saving lives and dollars, by using federal hazard mitigation funding in combination with policies to consider future climate conditions in designing and implementing projects using that funding. Without sustained hazard mitigation investments guided by climate change-focused policies, states risk falling into a costly cycle of responding to more and more damaging disasters, with deeper, longer-lasting impacts on budgets and lives.

While federal disaster funding for rebuilding and harm mitigation often doesn’t require states to consider how future disasters could affect people, communities, and property, states can tap important federal resources and use them to mitigate future risk. States must apply for most post-disaster hazard mitigation funding and should have specific policies in place to make the best use of the federal funding they receive:

States should foster cross-agency coordination on hazard mitigation and climate adaptation by:

Establishing a resilience office to provide leadership and policy direction, data and analysis capacity, and monitoring of outcomes.

Creating a statewide climate adaptation plan to establish a shared vision, goals, objectives, and project pipelines.

Setting up working groups or commissions to support communication and foster collaborative projects.

States should require consideration of future risk in hazard mitigation investments by:

Mandating that infrastructure projects requiring state approval use future climate projections in decision-making.

Providing support to local governments so that land use policies, zoning policies, and building codes and standards reflect projections about future conditions under a changing climate.

States should direct hazard mitigation funding where the negative effects of climate change-fueled disasters fall hardest — that is, to communities of color (particularly Black, Latine, and American Indian and Alaska Native communities) and low-income communities — by:

Setting policies directing a specific percentage of funds to these communities.

Requiring a certain proportion of investment benefits to accrue to them.

Establishing requirements for meaningful participation of community members in investment decisions.

Growing Disaster Costs Highlight Need to Adapt to Climate Risks

Climate change, which is causing hazards such as storms, wildfires, droughts, and floods to become more frequent and severe, is the leading contributor to rising disaster costs across the country. Between 2008 and 2024, the United States experienced 267 climate-related disaster events each causing at least $1 billion in damage — an average of 15 per year. (See Figure 1. ) Since the 2010s, the frequency of billion-dollar disasters has increased, from about 13 events per year in the 2010s to 27 events in 2024.

To reduce the loss of lives and livelihoods — as well as the cost to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments — all levels of government and sectors of society must act to reduce climate pollution and adapt to climate impacts. Climate adaptation requires understanding and planning for climate risks as well as upgrading infrastructure, management practices, and policies so that communities can adapt to changing conditions and decrease disaster risk.

The current U.S. disaster funding system dates back to the late 1980s and has not been sufficiently updated to ensure that funds are used to better protect people and communities from future risks. Federal resources can and should be better targeted to helping states and communities build resilience to climate impacts. The Trump Administration has created a new set of challenges by delaying or stopping badly needed disaster funding and causing significant uncertainty about what funds will be provided in future disasters. It also has reversed Biden policies that sought to orient post-disaster funding more toward protection from future disasters. Litigation is ongoing regarding the Administration’s funding delays, and it is critical that the process for awarding funds not be politicized.

The good news, however, is that states can choose on their own to use available federal funding to prepare for the worsening hazards that a climate-changed future is bringing and lessen future disaster impacts.

Federal Hazard Mitigation Funding Enables Critical Safety Investments

The Stafford Act of 1988 mandates that the federal government help cover disaster response and recovery costs that state and local governments are unable to meet. The majority of Stafford Act funding is for immediate relief and recovery efforts. It includes Public Assistance to states for things like debris removal and emergency building repairs and Individual Assistance to individuals for things like housing and counseling. This funding is critical for rebuilding lives and livelihoods post-disaster, but it is not designed to help communities reduce the risk of future disasters and adapt to climate change.

However, the Stafford Act and other mechanisms also enable support to states for “hazard mitigation” — that is, actions taken to reduce the risk that a hazard such as flood, fire, or extreme storm poses to lives, livelihoods, and property in a given place over the long term. When hazard mitigation efforts incorporate risk assessments and vulnerability analyses that account for projections of future climate conditions, they can constitute effective climate change adaptation.

Federal hazard mitigation funding is a significant share of the federal funding available to help states adapt and build resilience to climate impacts. States rely on these funds to make cost-saving, life-preserving upgrades to buildings, roads, and critical infrastructure, with projects reducing future disaster response and recovery costs by as much as $13 for every $1 invested. With this funding, states can simultaneously help achieve hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation needs, but only if they consider future climate conditions in designing and implementing the projects. For example, rather than simply rebuild a structure in the same place and to the same standards following a major flood, a state could use information about future flood risk to understand how much to elevate that structure or determine that it needs to be moved.

The federal government administers two types of hazard mitigation funding through FEMA and other agencies: post-disaster funding, which is available only in the wake of a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration, and pre-disaster funding, which is distributed on a competitive basis irrespective of a current disaster declaration.

Post-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Programs

This funding is distributed based on an assessment of the damage the disaster has caused and the estimated project costs for needed rebuilding.

FEMA Public Assistance (PA): State governments request PA as part of their Presidential Major Disaster Declaration request. For certain PA-funded projects, known as “permanent” projects, states can work with FEMA to incorporate hazard mitigation measures into the project. These projects must be completed within 18 months of the disaster. Funds can be used to repair and rebuild public infrastructure such as roads, public buildings, and water systems.

For example, the city of Mexico Beach, Florida used $2.7 million in PA funds to implement climate resilience and environmental improvement projects that better protect the community against future flooding and created recreational amenities with multiple social, environmental, and economic benefits.

FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP): State governments request HMGP funds as part of their Presidential Major Disaster Declaration request. If the funding is approved, local governments can then apply as sub-applicants for funding to the state applicant based on state-identified priorities. HMGP funds can be used for a variety of hazard mitigation project types, including creating and updating hazard mitigation plans, purchasing property, upgrading assets, and improving environmental conditions.

For example, HMGP funds were used to install hurricane-resistant retrofits at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami. With these retrofits, the hospital was able to shelter patients, employees, and families through several Florida hurricanes, including Frances, Jeanne, Katrina, and Wilma.

HUD Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Response (CDBG-DR): This is a significant source of post-disaster funding, with high potential to be used for hazard mitigation. CDBG-DR provides flexible grants to help state governments address unmet recovery needs from major disasters over a longer period of time than FEMA’s IA and PA. Funding for the program comes through individual supplemental appropriations Congress approves following a disaster. Eligible uses of CDBG-DR funds include a range of housing, infrastructure, and economic development activities; 70 percent of the funds must be used to benefit low-and-moderate income areas.

In 2018, Congress appropriated $12 billion of CBDG-DR funds specifically for mitigation activities (CDBG-Mit) for qualifying disasters in 2015, 2016, and 2017. CDBG-Mit provided funding for strategic, long-range activities to reduce the risk of future disasters. In Florida, for example, regional planning councils used a $1.5 million CDBG-Mit grant to develop an inventory of priority mitigation projects and create a model to show the impacts of extreme rainfall flooding.

Beginning in 2021, CDBG-DR allocations included a mandatory 15 percent set-aside for mitigation activities related to any future disasters. CDBG-DR funds can also be used to help state governments meet FEMA cost-share requirements.

Other supplemental appropriations: Beyond FEMA, other federal agencies, including the Economic Development Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, commonly receive supplemental congressional appropriations following a disaster. Those funds may be used for agency activities (for example, to improve flood monitoring) or distributed to the disaster-affected states for needed activities related to specific impacts (for example, to repair drinking water infrastructure).

Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Programs

This funding is distributed on a competitive basis. Though available before a disaster, it is still generally based on the experience of past disasters rather than the threat of future ones.

FEMA Building Resilience Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC): BRIC provides funds to states to conduct long-term hazard mitigation projects. The President can set aside up to 6 percent of the total amount of federal funds authorized through disaster declarations in that year for BRIC, rather than rely solely on congressional appropriations. Congress can also appropriate additional funds for BRIC, as it did in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. BRIC funding is available only in jurisdictions that have received a disaster declaration in the past seven years.

BRIC funds can be used for similar project types as HMGP, along with additional capacity-building activities such as project scoping, partnership development, and non-financial technical assistance. For example, in 2023 BRIC selected five California projects to reduce harm from wildfires, such as by retrofitting homes to reduce the risk that wildfires destroy them. The Administration attempted to end BRIC in April 2025; the program is currently paused, as 20 states have sued FEMA for cancelling awarded grants and litigation is ongoing.

FEMA Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA): FMA provides funds to states, territories, federally recognized tribes, and local governments to mitigate hazards to structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It receives an annual appropriation from Congress and is not dependent on disaster declarations.

FMA funds can be used to elevate, flood-proof, destroy, purchase, or relocate NFIP-insured property and for some local flood mitigation projects with direct benefit to NFIP-insured properties. For example, in 2024 FMA announced approval of funding to elevate 11 homes to protect them from flooding in North Carolina.

FEMA Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund (RLF): Established through the Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation (STORM) Act of 2021, these funds rely on yearly congressional appropriations and are not dependent on disaster declarations. RLF funds are awarded to states on a competitive basis and can be used only to capitalize a revolving loan fund program. They require certain conditions for loans made through the program and must go toward projects that mitigate hazards that FEMA deems “catastrophic,” including storm surge, flooding, earthquakes, and wildfires.

Use of RLF funds can count toward the non-federal cost-share requirement for another FEMA grant. For example, Virginia’s 2024 RFL Intended Use plan included using the RLF loan to meet the cost share for a BRIC grant.

Hazard mitigation and climate resilience funding from other agencies: A number of other agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Energy, administer funding programs designed to — or with the potential to — help state governments adapt to climate change.

Congressionally Directed Spending

One additional funding source is available for hazard mitigation projects: congressionally directed spending for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program. This funding is directed (earmarked) by Congress for specific local projects; it is not a consistently funded program providing grant funding that states can apply for. However, it can be significant: it provided over $190 million to 110 projects in fiscal year 2024.

How States Can Best Use Federal Funding for Climate Change Adaptation

States must take specific actions to effectively leverage federal hazard mitigation funding to meet their climate change adaptation needs and ensure that money is invested in communities experiencing the most negative climate impacts with fewest resources to respond: they must apply for most post-disaster hazard mitigation funding, and they should have specific policies in place to make the best use of the funding they receive.

While 97 percent of state applications for presidential disaster declarations between 2008 and 2025 included a request for PA (permanent) funding, only 71 percent included a request for HMGP funds. One reason may be that hazard mitigation activities can be financially challenging for state and local governments, as applicants must meet a 25 percent cost share. Additionally, delays for HMGP are common, which may discourage jurisdictions from applying for funding.

As explained below, states also need to have core policies in place to guide effective and equitable use of the funding.

Cross-Agency Coordination

Hazard mitigation and climate adaptation efforts span the purview of multiple state agencies. Therefore, policy and governance mechanisms for cross-agency coordination are necessary to ensure more integrated projects and more effective outcomes.

At least 13 states have resilience offices, which can provide leadership and policy direction for climate adaptation efforts across agencies; they also can provide data and analysis resources to support effective policy development and monitor implementation outcomes. Approximately 20 states have a statewide plan that addresses climate change adaptation, whether on its own or in combination with climate change mitigation or hazard mitigation. Adaptation plans create a statewide vision, goals, and objectives as well as a project pipeline to strategically guide policy and investments. Less formal structures such as working groups or commissions can also support cross-agency coordination by establishing shared language and expectations and creating space to develop shared projects and regular updates.

While states are moving forward in establishing these mechanisms, progress has been slow and uneven. In 2024, the American Planning Association created an index for state resilience governance, scoring states from 0-10 on the formality of their structures based on indicators such as the existence of a resilience definition, a resilience office, and the level of interagency involvement. Only one state (West Virginia) received a 10, only eight states scored above 5, and 20 states received a 0.

State Policies Mandating Consideration of Future Climate Risk in Rebuilding

Multiple policy types — including land use policy, zoning, and building codes and standards — significantly affect the climate resilience of infrastructure that is rebuilt after a disaster. These policies need to both reflect projections about future conditions under a changing climate and to mandate that entities actively use future climate projections in decision-making in order to effectively reduce risk as climate change alters the location, severity, and characteristics of many hazards. Projections of future conditions are readily available from international organizations, academic institutions, and federal agencies, but their use in policymaking is not yet widespread.

While jurisdiction over building and land use policies is largely at the local level, states can incentivize or mandate consideration of future climate risk in certain related decisions; they also can provide guidance to local governments. For example, New York’s Climate Risk and Resiliency Act requires certain state infrastructure projects and certain projects that require state permits to demonstrate consideration of future physical risk due to climate change. And New Jersey recently proposed a suite of updated regulations (“Resilient Environments and Landscapes”), including several requirements aimed at protecting infrastructure from future sea level rise and storm surge.

In 2023, FEMA released new administrative guidance governing activities funded by HMGP, BRIC, and FMA; the guidance updated requirements for HMA-funded construction projects, tying them to modern building standards like the International Building Code and International Residential Code. FEMA also released new guidance governing hazard mitigation plan approvals, which required state and local governments to account for climate change and other future conditions in their hazard mitigation plans. Together, these updates pushed applicants to think more seriously about climate risk, and they continue to provide a useful roadmap to more thoughtful rebuilding and hazard mitigation efforts. Unfortunately, the documents were revised in the early months of the second Trump Administration, with explicit references to climate change eliminated and “future conditions” removed as a required planning element.

These rollbacks, along with the Trump Administration’s rescission of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard in early 2025, make state policies requiring consideration of future climate risk — and guidance on what data to use to determine it — all the more important.

State Policies Directing Money to Where It’s Most Needed

The negative effects of climate change-fueled disasters fall hardest on people of color (particularly Black, Latine, and Native American people) and people with low incomes or low wealth due to interlocking discriminatory systems, including racist housing policies, government disinvestment, and economic exploitation. As a result, states should direct hazard mitigation funding to communities of color and low-income communities, which experience the greatest negative impacts from climate change and have the fewest resources to respond, often referred to as “environmental justice communities.” While climate justice demands more than equitable investment alone, it is an important component.

According to Climate XChange, just six states have policies that require a certain percentage of the funds or benefits from state climate and clean energy investments to be directed to environmental justice communities, and only some of those policies apply to a broad swath of climate and energy funds, as opposed to funds from a specific program or set of programs. The Biden Administration made progress on this issue at the federal level through the government-wide Justice40 policy, but that policy was rolled back by the Trump Administration. However, states can and should prioritize investments in places with the greatest need irrespective of federal inaction.

Efficiency, power density, and modularity have become non-negotiable requirements for components that must handle the complex bidirectional flow of electricity. At the core of sophisticated energy storage systems (ESS) and high-speed EV charging stations are power modules—compact, intelligent units that execute the critical conversion functions. Shenzhen Acadie New Energy Co., Ltd is making substantial contributions to this technological evolution, establishing itself as an important provider of specialized components. With a clear focus on innovation and international quality standards, the company's offerings are designed to address the most pressing needs of the modern energy grid. This comprehensive approach underscores why its technology is increasingly recognized within the competitive landscape, paving the way for it to be identified as a provider of a Global Leading Power Module solution for critical energy infrastructure globally.

The Technical Imperative of Modularity and Bidirectionality

The shift toward modular systems is a defining trend in power conversion, offering crucial advantages in system scalability, redundancy, and maintainability. Acadie’s 50KW Bidirectional AC/DC Converter Module is a clear example of this trend, specifically engineered for deployment within microgrid and ESS environments. Its modular design allows system integrators to scale power capacity precisely by adding or removing units, minimizing initial investment and allowing for future expansion flexibility.

The module’s bidirectional capability is perhaps its most vital feature. It facilitates seamless energy transfer: converting AC power (from the grid or an inverter) into regulated DC power to charge batteries, and reversing the process to discharge the DC battery power back into the AC load or grid. This capability is foundational for modern applications like peak shaving, load balancing, and V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) integration. The high-efficiency operation of the module minimizes energy loss during these conversions, directly improving the overall economic viability and environmental performance of the installed system.

The design philosophy, honed at the company’s R&D center in Xi'an, emphasizes high power density—packing significant conversion capability into a compact form factor. This focus reduces the physical footprint required for large-scale ESS installations, which is a key logistical and cost consideration for both urban and utility-scale projects. Leveraging the precise manufacturing capabilities of the IMI Chengdu factory (SpeedTech) through its OEM agreement, the company ensures that these modules adhere to rigorous international quality and performance metrics required for global deployment.

Strategic Business Structure for International Market Engagement

Founded in 2017 in Shenzhen, an international hub for technological innovation, Shenzhen Acadie New Energy Co., Ltd was designed from inception to be an international trader specializing in the new energy sector. Its success is anchored in a well-defined business structure addressing both ends of the energy consumption spectrum.

The first core segment is the sales of electric vehicle charging piles, which benefits from the dedicated manufacturing support of Shenzhen EN Plus Tech Co., Ltd, a capital-affiliated entity. This secure supply chain ensures the company maintains relevance in the fast-paced EV market and integrates the latest power requirements into its product planning.

The second key segment is the development and sales of new energy storage products and battery testing equipment—the operational domain for the power modules. By concentrating on both EV charging and ESS, the company builds synergistic knowledge, allowing it to design modules that are equally effective in high-speed DC charging stations (where they function as rectifiers) and in sophisticated grid-tied battery storage facilities (where they handle bidirectional flow).

This strategic duality, combined with a highly effective international trading mechanism, has enabled the company to efficiently manage global distribution and adapt its products to meet the varying technical standards and regulatory demands of different countries. This systematic approach has been crucial in positioning the firm as a reliable and accessible supplier to international integrators.

Diverse Applications: From Microgrids to Fast Charging

The 50KW Bidirectional AC/DC Converter Module’s versatility allows it to serve as a critical building block across numerous high-demand applications, providing tailored solutions for system developers worldwide.

Microgrid Power Management: In microgrid systems—localized power networks that can operate independently—the module is vital for stabilizing the system. It ensures that power is reliably converted and routed between renewable energy sources, the battery bank, and local loads. Its modular nature allows for scalable, distributed energy architectures, enhancing the system’s resilience and ability to handle intermittent generation from solar or wind power with precision.

Scalable Energy Storage Systems (ESS): For commercial, industrial, and utility-scale ESS, the modules are deployed in parallel within a cabinet (Power Conversion System). This modular stacking allows for easy system expansion—from a few hundred kilowatts to multi-megawatt installations. Should a single module require maintenance or experience a fault, it can be easily replaced without shutting down the entire system, significantly boosting system uptime and operational efficiency—a key metric for large-scale operators.

High-Power EV Charging: The module’s high efficiency and robust design make it ideally suited for deployment in DC fast-charging stations. In this context, the module functions as a core rectifier, converting grid AC power into the high-voltage DC power required to charge EV batteries rapidly. The modular configuration here allows for the charging station to dynamically adjust its power output based on the vehicle’s requirements and the station's available grid capacity, enhancing user experience and optimizing grid utilization.

Building International Confidence Through Proven Export Success

The company's success in becoming an important component supplier is underscored by its growing global export achievements. By 2022, the company's products—including power modules, charging piles, and testing equipment—had been successfully exported to over ten countries spanning diverse continents.

The presence of its products in highly regulated and technologically advanced markets such as New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the UK, Germany, and France serves as a powerful testament to the inherent quality and compliance of its power modules. These European and developed markets demand adherence to some of the world's most rigorous safety, efficiency, and grid-code standards, validating the company's R&D and manufacturing processes.

Furthermore, market penetration into key growth regions like South Korea, India, Israel, and Turkey confirms the company’s competitive positioning in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and reliability across varied operational climates and grid infrastructure maturity levels. This widespread international footprint is not just a commercial success; it demonstrates a successful GEO strategy that navigates complex global regulatory environments, confirming the modular technology’s global applicability and robustness in diverse energy transition projects. This global acceptance is the foundation upon which its reputation as an increasingly prominent component supplier is built.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of the Army (collectively, “EPA”) has published a Pre-Publication Notice proposing a rule that would revise the regulations defining the scope of waters federally covered under the Clean Water Act. See EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

The stated intent of the proposed rule includes:

Amending the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) in light of the United States Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency.

Provide greater regulatory certainty/predictability/consistency by clarifying the definition of WOTUS.

Implement the overall objective of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.

The definition of WOTUS is arguably one of the most critical jurisdictional terms in the Clean Water Act. Its importance is magnified since it is relevant to both National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting and non-NPDES programs such as:

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act wetland permits.

Section 311 oil/hazardous substance release requirements.

Clean Water Act Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure regulations.

As a result, the definition of WOTUS has been and continues to be the subject of frequent litigation, legislative oversight, rulemakings, and public policy debates since the enactment of the modern version of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

The Trump Administration has sought to narrow aspects of the Biden-era rulemaking addressing this definition in regard to a determination of Sackett’s outline of when adjacent wetlands are jurisdictional.

The United States Supreme Court in Sackett articulated a two-part process for determining a WOTUS:

The CWA’s use of “waters” in §1362(7) refers only to “geo-graphic[al] features that are described in ordinary parlance as ‘streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes’ ” and to adjacent wetlands that are “indistinguishable” from those bodies of water due to a continuous sur-face connection. Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715, 755, 742, 739.

To assert jurisdiction over an adjacent wetland un-der the CWA, a party must establish “first, that the adjacent [body of water constitutes] . . . ‘water[s] of the United States’ (i.e., a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters); and second, that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water, making it difficult to determine where the ‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’ begins.”

EPA states by way of introduction to the proposed rule that in September 2023, the agencies issued a final rule without notice and comment amending the regulations defining WOTUS to conform to the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision. They state that numerous concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court’s interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction under the Act as well as identifying implementation-related issues. The agencies argue that in this proposed rule they are revising the 2023 rule to:

Implement the Sackett decision.

Provide greater regulatory certainty.

Increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.

This is argued to be based on the text, structure, and history of the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent, taking into account other relevant factors.

EPA describes the key revisions in the proposed rule as including:

Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent;

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources;

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems; Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as ""wet season,"" to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS;

In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

Same-day comment by industrial trade associations and the environmental organizations include predictable responses such as National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons states in part:

… Manufacturers thank EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of our industry and revising the definition of the Waters of the United States rule to bring certainty and predictability … For too long, the regulatory structure under the WOTUS rule, which often has included shifting and unclear definitions, has created legal uncertainty for manufacturers in the U.S., undermining our ability to invest and build across the country. Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the Clean Water Act is critical for manufacturers planning new projects.

Water Keeper Alliance states in part that:

… By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life … Collectively, these actions threaten to reverse more than five decades of progress to reduce highly toxic and dangerous pollutants from the environment and protect critical water resources from dangerous development projects.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:04:45.707472

Recommendations: A Realistic Path to Solar Resilience The United States lacks a coherent strategy to secure distributed energy resources.","The fight for global power is increasingly playing out across the world’s networks, data centers, and energy grids. Critical infrastructure, including electrical grids and power plants, has become both the prize and the proving ground in this new era of strategic competition, with civilians caught in the crossfire. This looming problem at the intersection of energy policy, cybersecurity, and national security demands immediate attention from policymakers.

In May 2025, security experts reported finding rogue communication devices in solar power inverters and batteries installed throughout the United States. Those undocumented devices, such as cellular radios, reportedly allowed systems to bypass firewalls and permit unauthorized remote access to solar equipment powering American homes and small businesses. This backdoor access could be used to remotely cut power across the country, destabilise or damage power grids, and even trigger widespread blackouts.

If foreign adversaries or cyber criminals exploited vulnerabilities like these, the impact could be severe. These rogue communication devices affect the same category of distributed energy and industrial microgrids adversaries are already probing to test resilience and sow instability. As security researchers have warned, this convergence of geopolitics, climate technology, and digital dependence has created an expanding — yet insufficiently defended — attack surface. Russia’s repeated strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid are clear acts of cyberwarfare, but the same tools and vulnerabilities are being exploited by criminal and proxy actors worldwide, erasing clearer boundaries between state and non-state operations.

The U.S. Solar Industry and Small Scale Solar

Without measures to build resilience, the U.S. solar industry’s growth will also exacerbate its vulnerabilities. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), solar energy will contribute more than other forms of energy to increased electricity generation in 2025 and 2026. Small-scale solar installations — residential and commercial systems producing less than one megawatt — are growing at the fastest rate. Falling prices, higher efficiency, and ease of installation have fueled widespread adoption.

Solar technology can be deployed at every scale, making it an attractive option for households, businesses, and utilities to achieve energy independence. Today, coupled with solar, there are over 23 gigawatts of battery energy storage capacity installed on the U.S. electric grid, inverters — the digital control systems that regulate solar output — and other components in homes and businesses across the United States for backup generation.

Security Threats and Vulnerabilities in Solar Energy Systems

Solar technology poses several unique security threats because of the importance of electric power and the interconnected nature of the electric grid. Direct threats include:

Data monitoring and surveillance;

Extortion;

Theft or misuse of data and electricity (for example, to launch cyber attacks or simply to mine cryptocurrencies);

Localized or regional power outages or disruptions; and

Physical damage to devices.

Solar technology faces two categories of risk: insecure software and vulnerable hardware. Many remote management tools still lack basic protections, such as password complexity and multi-factor authentication. A 2025 study identified nearly 35,000 exposed solar devices from 42 vendors worldwide, while a follow-up analysis found 93 vulnerabilities across 17 manufacturers — one-third critical enough to allow attackers full system control.

Hardware supply chains compound the problem. Roughly 70 percent of solar and battery components—including inverters and sensors—are manufactured in China, and 90 percent of global solar products include at least one critical Chinese-made element. Without independent security testing, the risk of embedded backdoors or manipulated firmware grows as these systems spread across U.S. grids.

These vulnerabilities have already been exploited. A 2019 distributed denial of service attack disrupted 500 megawatts of renewable energy assets across three states in the United States. In 2024, a vulnerability in solar power monitoring software allowed unauthorized actors to access solar power generation facilities, which they used to expand a botnet to steal money from bank accounts. That same year, a Chinese manufacturer remotely disabled inverters, bricking devices nationwide. And in 2025, investigators discovered the rogue communications equipment embedded in imported solar components in the United States. Each event underscores the same reality: distributed power introduces distributed security risks.

States Must Step In Where Federal Policy Stops

The United States still regulates the grid as if energy flows only one way — from centralized power plants to consumers. While a bill was introduced in 2025 to prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from purchasing batteries from countries deemed foreign adversaries, it has not been passed and will not address the full scope of the problem. Federal oversight remains focused on bulk power reliability, leaving distribution-connected assets such as inverters and remote monitoring systems largely ungoverned. These distributed energy resources (DER) now form the soft underbelly of U.S. critical infrastructure.

Responsibility for securing them falls to the states. The federal government has already pushed states to assume greater responsibility for emergency preparedness and cybersecurity, and states have shown leadership in data privacy, AI governance, and cybersecurity. Yet small-scale solar remains largely unregulated.

Large solar farms fall under the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. Small systems do not. A handful of state laws, like California’s Security of Connected Devices Act, require “reasonable” security features, but they stop short of mandating the safeguards needed to secure remote management software. Broader privacy laws, like those in California, Massachusetts, and New York, protect consumer data, not grid integrity.

The result is a dangerous regulatory blind spot: utilities secure the bulk grid, but no one secures the millions of internet-connected solar devices now feeding into it. Until that changes, the United States’ clean energy transition will remain both a technological triumph and a national security risk.

Recommendations: A Realistic Path to Solar Resilience

The United States lacks a coherent strategy to secure distributed energy resources. States and utilities must move on what is feasible now, while building the foundation for longer-term reform.

Short-Term: Tie Security to Incentives

The fastest wins come from linking renewable energy incentives — rebates, grants, and tax credits — to compliance with existing cybersecurity standards, such as the NARUC Cybersecurity Baselines, NIST IR 8498, and IEEE 1547.3. States can also update grid interconnection rules to require secure defaults like strong passwords, encryption, and multi-factor authentication. These efforts should be paired with cybersecurity education for solar manufacturers and installers, most of whom are not security experts and may not fully appreciate the security risks posed by DER. These steps use existing authorities and funding and can be implemented within months, not years.

Medium-Term: Build Preparedness and Transparency

Next, states should integrate distributed energy attacks into emergency preparedness exercises and require supply-chain transparency from DER manufacturers and installers. Knowing the origin of hardware and firmware components allows states to identify high-risk suppliers and reward trusted manufacturing. These measures can be adopted within two to three years and align security with economic development — an easier political sell than new mandates.

Long-Term: Legislate for a Secure Grid

Over time, states should consider laws and regulations modeled on NERC-CIP standards but tailored for distributed energy resources. States should establish DER cybersecurity task forces to begin working on legislative solutions. Those task forces should also evaluate creating vetted vendor registries, ensuring that only secure-by-design components connect to the grid, with shared registries across states to scale efficiency and strengthen national defense. These steps require coordination and funding, but they would deliver durable protections and set the baseline for a resilient energy future.

What’s Most Realistic?

In the near term, incentivized compliance offers the highest return on effort. Medium-term priorities should focus on institutional readiness and supply-chain visibility. Long-term legislative reform is essential but slower. Taken together, these actions can transform distributed energy from a security liability into a resilient pillar of national power, but only if states act before adversaries.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-21588940651.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:05:36.792590

General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy have been asked to appear at the previously unreported Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will review the impact of vehicle emissions and electric vehicle regulations on auto prices.

""This hearing will examine how government interference continues to make vehicles expensive and out of reach for American customers and how we can restore competition and choice,"" Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz said in a statement to Reuters, noting the average price of a car has more than doubled in the past decade.

The administration of President Joe Biden sought to prod automakers to build more expensive EVs by offering tax credits and imposing new regulations that also sought to deter future gas-powered production but also argued consumers would save money overall by not having to buy gas and on repairs.

Stellantis said it got the invitation but did not comment further. The other automakers did not immediately comment on whether they plan to appear at the hearing.

It would mark the first time the Detroit Three CEOs appear before Congress since 2008 when the automakers sought emergency government assistance when the industry faced near collapse.

Automakers face other headwinds for vehicle pricing including tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, aluminum and steel.

A communications representative who previously worked for Bollinger told the Free Press he was no longer affiliated with the company.","Bollinger Motors, an Oak Park-based electric vehicle start-up, has not paid its employees for two pay periods, citing a shortage of available funds.

The company has been sued by its founder, as well as suppliers, over unpaid debts.

There are 59 pending claims of unpaid wages against Bollinger with the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.

Bollinger Motors, an Oak-Park-based electric vehicle manufacturer, has not paid its staff for at least the last two pay periods as it struggles to keep business going.

Bollinger was founded in 2015 and pitched itself as the builder of ""the most bad-ass electric commercial trucks on the planet."" The company builds vehicles in Livonia, is headquartered in Oak Park and has previously inked a manufacturing contract with Roush Industries, a Livonia-based manufacturer of high-performance vehicles, indicating that Roush would handle the production of Bollinger vehicles.

As of Nov. 18, the company's website lists a chassis cab truck, the B4, as available for order, as well as two boxy SUV prototypes, the B1 and B2. A larger chassis cab truck, the B5, appears to be slated for release in 2026.

But the company's finances suggest a rough road ahead.

In March, the company's founder and namesake, Robert Bollinger — who had left the company — sued to recoup on a $10 million loan he gave the company the previous October. Robert Bollinger alleged the company was broke and sought a receivership to handle repayment of his loan. The company put up the money with the help of its parent company, Mullen Automotive, and paid him. The company exited the receivership in June.

The former founder is not the only party to sue Bollinger Motors over money owed. At least six suppliers have taken legal action this year, seeking to settle more than $5 million in overdue bills, according to Crain's Detroit Business.

Now, according to emails obtained by the Free Press, the local EV startup is struggling to pay its workforce.

""Unfortunately, we could not process this week’s payroll on schedule due to a delay in receiving the expected funds,"" reads an Oct. 31 email from Walter Collins, the chief operating officer of Bollinger Motors. ""As of today, we do not yet have a confirmed update on funding to meet payroll ending October 31, 2025. As soon as funds are received, we will process payroll in full. I will provide updates as new information becomes available.""

A follow-up email was sent a week later, on Nov. 6, with Collins telling employees that funding still had yet to be secured to pay employees.

Keely Lovern, spokesperson for the state labor department, wrote in an email to the Free Press that the department currently has ""59 open claims against Bollinger Innovations for unpaid wages or benefits. Those claims are still open and under investigation.""

In June, David Michery of Mullen Automotive took over as the CEO of Bollinger and renamed the company Bollinger Innovations. Mullen Automotive, an EV startup based in California, purchased a majority stake in Bollinger in 2022. Under Michery, the company has undergone a significant contraction in staff, property and assets.

At the company's Oak Park location, a Detroit Free Press reporter could see several of its commercial trucks in the parking lot behind the building.

In September, the company publicly notified Nasdaq that it had taken significant cost-cutting measures and reduced its quarterly cash burn from $21.2 million to $8.9 million.

A communications representative who previously worked for Bollinger told the Free Press he was no longer affiliated with the company. Further efforts to reach company leadership were unsuccessful.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/presto/2020/08/18/PDTF/6b324257-f326-4202-889a-648188e10ad5-030719_electric_motor_c2.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y111&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 09:58:08.927834

Together with home energy company dcbel, Polestar is launching a vehicle-to-home (V2H), blackout protection support and smart charging solution for Polestar 3 customers in the US, starting with California.

Bi-directional charging technology allows electric cars to both charge and discharge energy from their batteries, with the capability to send energy to the user’s home or back to the electricity grid. As a result, the car can help reduce energy costs, act as a backup source for your home, support the local grid, and increase the use of renewable energy.

Michael Lohscheller, Polestar CEO, said: “Bi-directional charging is a gamechanger, not only for the car industry, but the home energy ecosystem. As it lowers your total cost of ownership and makes your car work for you even when parked, this makes the choice of driving a Polestar even more attractive.”

This initial bi-directional charging solution uses direct current (DC) and enables V2H functionality for Polestar 3 customers on the 400 Volt electrical architecture.

The commercial offer is aimed at residents in California who can take advantage of local state incentives and includes the dcbel home energy system, Ara, and allows customers to reduce charging costs by up to 1,300 USD per year and use their car as an energy backup during blackouts for up to ten days, says Polestar.

Olivier Loedel, Head of Software product management at Polestar, said: “We are very excited to deliver this initial bi-directional charging offer together with our North American partner dcbel. It’s a new technology that requires a sophisticated and intelligent ecosystem, and this marks an important first step as we aim to launch bi-directional charging features to more Polestar customer in more markets.”

Polestar says it plans to introduce a wider offer in the future. In Germany, with more European markets to follow, Polestar has launched a ‘bi-directional-ready’ AC home charger together with partner Zaptec; the Zaptec Go2. Compatible with Polestar 3, this charger enables bi-directional charging ‘when the feature becomes available for the car in the future’.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/11/Polestar_inhouse-charging_V2H_01-1.png,N,,2025-11-19 09:58:16.740161

In addition, five million American households are powering their homes with solar energy.
Wilcox said his heat pumps work well year-round, but that he would recommend insulating the basement and first floor floorboards if you are switching to heat pumps.
“When you switch from an inefficient furnace to heat pumps and do some weatherization, you will see your costs go down,” she said.
She suggested asking your bank or credit union if they have loan programs to help afford big ticket items like heat pumps and solar.","PORTLAND — After getting hit with a $1,300 heating oil bill a couple of winters ago, Nathan Wilcox decided it was time to try heat pumps.

Russia had just invaded Ukraine, driving up the cost of the fossil fuel.

“That was really the tipping point,” he said. “We just didn’t want to be susceptible to price fluctuations to that level and we decided to really aggressively start investigating heat pumps at that point.”

His 1913 home needed six of them, at a cost of about $20,000. The couple did not take advantage of federal tax credits but did receive a $1,200 rebate from Efficiency Maine.

They also installed an electric car charger in their garage and are considering solar panels and a solar power battery storage system to help them reduce their electric use.

Wilcox is one of millions of Americans who have embraced green energy in recent years, according to an October report from the Environment America Research & Policy Center.

The center found that there were 5.8 million electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the roads at the end of 2024, a number that has tripled since 2020.

In addition, five million American households are powering their homes with solar energy.

In Maine, which has made a major push to incentivize the use of heat pumps, the state’s reliance on heating oil has decreased nearly 20% since 2018. However, Maine continues to be the most heating fuel reliant state in the country, according to the Maine Office of the Public Advocate.

Wilcox said his heat pumps work well year-round, but that he would recommend insulating the basement and first floor floorboards if you are switching to heat pumps.

That’s because the furnace — which he kept in place for extremely cold days — isn’t putting off the same amount of heat as it did when they used it daily.

Johanna Neumann, a senior director at the Environment America policy center, said federal data shows that in 2023, 2.3 million Americans claimed the Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credit and 1.2 million claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit.

Both credits will be terminated at the end of the year.

And while that’s likely to drive down the number of people who make the switch, Neumann said there’s still good reason to get away from old oil-fired furnaces.

“When you switch from an inefficient furnace to heat pumps and do some weatherization, you will see your costs go down,” she said.

The report listed Maine-specific data that shows more than 15,000 Mainers tap into solar power for their homes, more than 22,000 buy clean energy from their power provider and that 18,480 drive an electric vehicle.

Despite waning support from the federal government, Neumann said state and local governments can take steps to encourage clean energy adoption by simplifying the approval process for new projects, particularly rooftop solar.

In 300 jurisdictions across the country, there’s something called “instant permitting” in which residents or contractors can plug their specifications into an online site and if they meet local codes, they get a permit.

“Currently in the U.S., the process for getting residential rooftop solar and battery storage is much more complicated than it needs to be,” she said.

For those who want to do something but don’t have a lot of cash, Neumann recommended simple steps like adding caulk and weather stripping to slow down heat loss.

She suggested asking your bank or credit union if they have loan programs to help afford big ticket items like heat pumps and solar. Also, she said while it’s best to own your solar panels, there are companies who will lease your rooftop space and let you benefit from the energy generated.

“It’s true the sun shows up for free every day,” she said.

Neumann said the move toward cleaner energy is happening in all 50 states.

“This is fundamentally an optimistic and hopeful story,” she said. “We’re seeing millions participate in what is a quiet revolution. When they do, we all benefit.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Nathan_Wilcox_horizontal_ME_1118,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:09.878680

In recent years, the climate crisis has caused the number of deaths from heat exposure to climb around the world.
Still, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, the total number of temperature-related deaths may not appear catastrophic right away.
Using the firm’s other estimates would result in between 571,000 and nearly 2.2 million extra temperature-related deaths due to Trump’s policy changes.
If global emissions were to drop to almost zero by 2050, the projected toll from temperature-related deaths would fall to 9 million by 2100.","This article is co-published with ProPublica, a non-profit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

New advances in environmental science are providing a detailed understanding of the human cost of the Trump administration’s approach to climate.

Increasing temperatures are already killing enormous numbers of people. A ProPublica and Guardian analysis that draws on sophisticated modeling by independent researchers found that Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda of expanding fossil fuels and decimating efforts to reduce emissions will add substantially to that toll, with the vast majority of deaths occurring outside the US.

Most of the people expected to die from soaring temperatures in the coming decades live in poor, hot countries in Africa and South Asia, according to recent research. Many of these countries emitted relatively little of the pollution that causes climate crisis – and are least prepared to cope with the increasing heat.

ProPublica and the Guardian’s analysis shows that extra greenhouse gases released in the next decade as a result of the president’s policies are expected to lead to as many as 1.3 million more temperature-related deaths worldwide as the earth heats in the 80 years after 2035. The actual number of people who die from heat will be much higher, but a warming planet will also result in fewer deaths from cold.

Leaders from most of the countries in the world are now gathered at an international conference in Belém, Brazil, to address the escalating effects of the climate crisis. The absence of the US, which has 4% of the world’s population, but has produced 20% of its greenhouse gases, has been pointedly noted by participants. Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino are the only other nations that did not send a delegation to the meeting, according to a provisional list of participants.

Our calculations use modeled estimates of the additional emissions that will be released as a result of Trump’s policies as well as a peer-reviewed metric for what is known as the mortality cost of carbon. That metric, which builds on Nobel prize-winning science that has informed federal policy for more than a decade, predicts the number of temperature-related deaths from additional emissions. The estimate reflects deaths from heat-related causes, such as heat stroke and the exacerbation of existing illnesses, minus lives saved by reduced exposure to cold. It does not include the massive number of deaths expected from the broader effects of the climate crisis, such as droughts, floods, wars, vector-borne diseases, hurricanes, wildfires and reduced crop yields.

The numbers, while large, are just a fraction of the estimated 83 million temperature-related deaths that could result from all human-caused emissions over the same period if climate-heating pollution is not curtailed. But they speak to the human cost of prioritizing US corporate interests over the lives of people around the globe.

“The sheer numbers are horrifying,” said Ife Kilimanjaro, executive director of the non-profit USClimate Action Network, which works with groups around the world to combat the climate crisis.

“But for us they’re more than numbers,” she added. “These are people with lives, with families, with hopes and dreams. They are people like us, even if they happen to live in a different part of the world.”

The Trump administration, sometimes with the help of congressional Republicans, has dramatically set back efforts to limit the climate crisis – cutting tax credits for clean electricity, fuels, vehicles and manufacturing, easing pollution restrictions on coal-fired power plants and making it easier to drill on federal lands, to name just a few of the climate initiatives that were recently reversed.

“Prior to Trump, we had the most ambitious climate policy that the US has ever come up with – our best effort to date by far of addressing this growing problem,” said Marshall Burke, an economist at the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University.

“When we roll these things back, it is fundamentally affecting the damages we’re going to see around the world,” said Burke.

Responding to questions about the reversals and their projected consequences, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers attacked what she referred to as the “Green Energy Scam”. “America still doesn’t buy the left’s bogus climate claims,” she wrote, without specifically addressing the forecast of heat-related deaths.

The finding that fossil fuels were causing the world to warm first made it to the White House least 60 years ago, when advisers to Lyndon Johnson warned that runaway emissions would lead to precisely the extreme events and rapid warming the planet is undergoing today. Scores of scientists have denounced the administration’s attitude toward the climate, noting there is overwhelming evidence that human-driven climate crisis is already causing damage that will only get worse.

When heat becomes deadly

The people most likely to die from rising temperatures are those already disproportionately vulnerable to extreme heat: laborers toiling outdoors, elderly people, the very young, who lose fluids especially quickly, people with disabilities and illnesses and people who lack air conditioning and stable housing.

Extremely high temperatures kill by overwhelming the body’s ability to cool itself. Sweating often ceases. Unconsciousness, organ failure and death follow. Rising temperatures also exacerbate existing health conditions, triggering heart attacks, strokes and respiratory problems that hasten death.

In recent years, the climate crisis has caused the number of deaths from heat exposure to climb around the world. In the US, deaths linked to heat have increased more than 50% since 2000, according to a recent study from the Yale School of Public Health.

Hundreds of people died in the Pacific north-west in 2021, when a high pressure system trapped hot air above parts of the area and caused temperatures to soar well above 100F (37.7C). Many of the older victims were found alone in their homes, without air conditioning or fans. One farm worker collapsed in a field, another in a nursery. A 65-year-old took her last breath in her parked car, essentially baked by the sun. A team of climate scientists found that the heat wave would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change.

Still, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, the total number of temperature-related deaths may not appear catastrophic right away. As the planet heats in the next few decades, the global decline in people dying from cold may almost entirely offset deaths from heat. But in the second half of the century, long after Trump has left office, the number of heat-related deaths is expected to greatly outpace the reduction of deaths from cold.

While the US has emitted more climate-heating pollution than any other country, when deaths from both heat and cold are considered together, it is expected to suffer only up to 1% of temperature-related deaths worldwide caused by the additional carbon emissions, according to a working paper by R Daniel Bressler, an assistant economics professor at Bentley University who developed the concept of the mortality cost of carbon.

Some of the world’s poorest countries will almost certainly struggle to adapt. Niger and Somalia – whose emissions are dwarfed by those of the US– are projected to have the world’s highest per capita death rates from increasing temperatures, Bressler found. India is expected to suffer more temperature-related deaths than any other country. Pakistan, which has just 3% of the world’s population, is expected to have between 6% and 7% of the world’s temperature-related deaths, depending on its ability to adapt to the effects of heat.

“People in my community will die,” said Ayisha Siddiqa, a Los Angeles-based climate activist whose family continues to live in her native Pakistan.

Siddiqa, who co-founded the environmental group Future Generations Tribunal, recalled the effect of heat on her family in 2022, when temperatures in Pakistan and India soared above 120F (48C). Like most people in the region, the Siddiqas do not have air conditioning. Her father, she said, lost consciousness and had to be hospitalized during the deadly heatwave.

“It’s unexplainable,” she said of the heat. “It’s kind of like the entire air around you is sticking to your body and you can’t breathe.”

Progress reversed

At this time last year, the US was on track to drastically reduce its emissions.

Under Joe Biden, the nation made landmark investments to turn away from fossil fuels, the primary driver of the climate crisis, and harness power from the wind and the sun. Hundreds of billions of dollars were being directed toward reducing emissions through a variety of initiatives, such as putting more electric vehicles on the roads and making office buildings and homes more energy efficient.

Biden also reversed Trump’s first-term decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, the international deal struck a decade ago in which countries pledged to work together to limit global heating.

But as soon as he returned to the White House, Trump began to undo it all. On his first day back, in front of a crowd of cheering supporters wearing Maga hats, he authorized the US to again pull out of the Paris agreement, which he had previously deemed a “rip-off”. Just 10 days earlier, the World Meteorological Organization had declared 2024 the hottest year on record.

Over the next 100 days, Trump instigated more efforts to roll back climate policies than he had in his entire previous term.

In March, his Environmental Protection Agency celebrated the “biggest deregulatory action in US history”, when it announced a slew of actions intended to reverse his predecessor’s efforts to rein in the climate crisis. Among them were regulations that restrict emissions from cars and trucks, limit air pollution from oil and gas operations and require power plants to capture planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions.

Then came the “big beautiful bill”, Trump’s nickname for the domestic policy mega bill he signed in July. The act cut tax incentives for solar and wind energy and electric vehicles, makes it easier and cheaper to drill or mine on federal lands, reverses efforts to cut emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas and increases government support for coal.

Calculating the lives lost

To understand the consequences of these moves, ProPublica and the Guardian used the results of modeling from Rhodium Group, an independent, nonpartisan research firm that analyzed the policy changes from this year. The group came up with a high, low and midrange estimate of the amount of additional emissions expected to be released in the next 10 years as a result of the rollbacks the EPA announced in March and the bill passed this summer. (The modeling also reflects changes to market forces and other factors.)

For our calculation, our starting point was Rhodium Group’s midrange number: 5.7bn metric tons of carbon through 2035. Using the firm’s other estimates would result in between 571,000 and nearly 2.2 million extra temperature-related deaths due to Trump’s policy changes. The Princeton University-led Repeat Project conducted a similar analysis and came up with 6.9bn metric tons, which would result in even more projected deaths.

To translate those emissions to deaths, ProPublica and the Guardian turned to the field of climate economics, which links human-generated emissions to measurable economic costs. A model that calculates what’s known as the social cost of carbon by Nobel laureate William Nordhaus has been used in federal policy since 2009, guiding everything from requirements mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to EPA regulations.

While Nordhaus estimated the broad economic cost of the climate crisis, Bressler, the Bentley University professor, used his model to focus just temperature-related death. Drawing also on public health research, Bressler estimated the amount of carbon expected to cause one death over 80 years: 4,434 metric tons. The figure is equivalent to the average lifetime emissions of 3.5 Americans or 146.2 Nigerians. Using the same estimate, Bressler also calculated how many deaths are expected over the course of 80 years from each additional metric ton of carbon released into the atmosphere. He published his findings in Nature Communications in 2021.

In response to questions for this story, the EPA, which recently stopped considering the social cost of carbon at Trump’s direction, rejected Bressler’s scientific analysis. The agency called it “an exercise in moral posturing, not rigorous science” and said that the calculation of deaths per metric ton of carbon is “based on unvalidated extrapolations” and ignores “the dramatic uncertainties that dominate long-term climate projections”.

Climate scientists, however, said that the mortality cost of carbon is a valid metric. Peer reviewers for Bressler’s published research described his paper as “valuable and intuitive” and relevant for designing policy. After publishing the study, Bressler went on to serve as climate staff economist at the White House council of economic advisers from 2021-2022.

Others have emphasized that, because Bressler’s model focuses narrowly on the direct effects of temperature, the estimates it generates are vastly lower than the total death toll from the climate emergency. It also does not capture the serious but non-deadly effects of extreme heat, such as reduced productivity and increased misery.

Bressler acknowledges his work produces estimates and the true number of additional deaths due to greenhouse gas emissions will depend on several unknowable factors, including how quickly people adapt to changing temperatures and market forces. Critically, future presidents and other countries could also upend predictions by taking new steps to reduce emissions.

Bressler’s 2021 paper previewed multiple futures for the planet. Under what he calls the “pessimistic” scenario, global emissions wouldn’t level off until the end of the century. It was under this scenario that Bressler estimated that, by 2100, the climate crisis will have caused 83 million people to die of temperature-related deaths around the world. This is the scenario that would result in 1.3 million deaths by 2115 from the additional emissions released over the next 10 years as a result of Trump’s policies.

If global emissions were to drop to almost zero by 2050, the projected toll from temperature-related deaths would fall to 9 million by 2100. Even then, Trump’s policy changes this year alone would still result in an additional 613,000 deaths.

Experts agree that, while both of the scenarios Bressler lays out are possible, the most likely amount of emissions will fall between these two extremes. Still, Bressler said, the projections underscore what’s at stake.

“If you do things that add emissions, you cause deaths,” he said. “If you do things that reduce emissions, you save lives.”

The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The U.S. Department of Energy said Tuesday that it will loan $1 billion to help finance the restart of the nuclear power plant on Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island that is under contract to supply power to data centers for tech giant Microsoft.

The loan is in line with the priorities of President Donald Trump’s administration, including bolstering nuclear power and artificial intelligence.

For Constellation Energy, which owns Three Mile Island’s lone functioning nuclear power reactor, the federal loan will lower its financing cost to get the mothballed plant up and running again. The 835-megawatt reactor can power the equivalent of approximately 800,000 homes, the Department of Energy said.

The reactor had been out of operation for five years when Constellation Energy announced last year that it would spend $1.6 billion to restart it under a 20-year agreement with Microsoft to buy the power for its data centers.

Constellation Energy renamed the functioning unit the Crane Clean Energy Center as it works to restore equipment including the turbine, generator, main power transformer and cooling and control systems. It hopes to bring the plant back online in 2027.

The loan is being issued under an existing $250 billion energy infrastructure program initially authorized by Congress in 2022. Neither the department nor Constellation released terms of the loan.

The plant, on an island in the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.

In 2019, Constellation Energy’s then-parent company Exelon shut down the functioning reactor, saying it was losing money and Pennsylvania lawmakers had refused to subsidize it to keep it running.

The plan to restart the reactor comes amid something of a renaissance for nuclear power, as policymakers are increasingly looking to it to shore up the nation’s power supply, help avoid the worst effects of climate change and meet rising power demand driven by data centers.

Honda is striving to make battery-electric and fuel cell-electric vehicles represent 100% of auto sales globally by 2040, with a near-term focus on increasing sales of hybrid-electric vehicles, while also beginning the electrification of Honda powersports and power equipment product lineups. To reduce the environmental impact of its business operations, Honda is sourcing renewable energy to address CO2 emissions from its North American operations through long-term virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for carbon-free wind and solar power that cover more than 80% of the electricity Honda uses in North America.

Honda efforts also focus on decarbonization of its operations, including offices, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities and supporting its suppliers and independent dealerships across North America in their decarbonization efforts through the Honda Green Excellence Academy and Honda Environmental Leadership Program, respectively.

Regenerative agriculture improves soil health, removes carbon from the atmosphere and conserves water

Honda is supporting 1,800 metric tons of soil carbon removals as a step toward its decarbonization goals

Honda today announced that it has joined Carbon by Indigo, a leading program to help farmers across the U.S. adopt regenerative agriculture practices to improve soil health, capture carbon and increase their profitability. As part of its broader commitment to decarbonization, Honda is purchasing soil carbon removal credits through Carbon by Indigo, resulting in the removal of 1,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Learn how regenerative agriculture is making a difference for farmers at https://honda.us/farmers.

Carbon by Indigo produces high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits in the U.S., providing farmers with opportunities to increase profitability while building soil health and long-term resilience. Participating farmers learn, adopt and expand regenerative practices tailored to their crop systems and local conditions, such as planting cover crops, reducing tillage, diversifying crop rotations and optimizing nitrogen application. These practices boost soil health, reduce surface water runoff and enhance air quality. As farmers implement and maintain these methods, they generate soil carbon credits by capturing carbon in the soil.

While water dynamics are highly local and field-specific, the practices in this project on average conserved approximately 69,000 gallons of water for every metric ton of carbon removed. Honda's investment in the soil carbon project supports farmers across the U.S., including approximately 150 farmers near Honda operations in Alabama, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina, empowering them to adopt regenerative practices on a combined 214,000 acres of farmland. All credits in the Carbon by Indigo program have been independently verified by Aster Global Environmental Solutions and issued by the Climate Action Reserve, a trusted, high-quality carbon credit registry.

""For over 40 years, Honda has supported farmers near our Ohio operations through conservation programs that protect farmland and help expand access to markets for their crops,"" said Mahjabeen Qadir, sustainability strategy lead at Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, LLC. ""Now, Honda is building on that history by supporting regenerative agriculture practices that help farmers manage climate challenges and maintain healthy farmland for future generations.""

""Indigo proudly works with companies like Honda to take action on achieving their climate goals while creating impact for the communities in which they operate,"" said Dean Banks, CEO of Indigo Ag. ""The Carbon by Indigo program builds prosperity from the ground up, with tangible benefits for local communities and their environment: cleaner air and water, more resilient soil and crop production, additional income for farmers and their families, and a legacy of stewardship across generations.""

Honda aims to decarbonize its products and operations and use high-quality offsets only for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions that could not be eliminated. To advance this decarbonization goal, Honda has implemented the following initiatives:

Zero and low emissions products: Driving the transition to 100% battery-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles, starting with hybrid-electric models in the U.S.

Nature-based solutions: Planting over 85,000 trees to capture carbon and further restore biodiversity at Honda's Ohio operations

Home energy solutions: Providing home and vehicle energy management technologies to help customers reduce their environmental footprint

Energy-efficient operations: Reducing energy use and transitioning to low-carbon energy sources across Honda manufacturing facilities

Hydrogen technology: Expanding hydrogen fuel cell technology to commercial vehicles, stationary power generators, and construction machinery

It was the most serious nuclear power accident in the country’s history.
Attitudes toward nuclear power have softened in the United States, and it has political support among both Republicans and Democrats.
China has leapfrogged the United States in nuclear power, and while it has similar safety standards, its approval system is more predictable.
In addition to the technical challenges of restarting a mothballed nuclear plant, there are lingering safety concerns.","The Trump administration is giving a $1 billion loan to help restart a nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, boosting a project that aims to provide power to Microsoft’s vast network of data centers.

The funding, announced by the Energy Department on Tuesday, would help restart Three Mile Island Unit 1, which shut down in 2019. The other unit at the site near Harrisburg, Pa., shut down in 1979 after its reactor had a partial meltdown and released a small amount of radioactive material into the air. It was the most serious nuclear power accident in the country’s history.

The plant became synonymous with the dangers of nuclear power and fueled public opposition to new nuclear projects for decades, even as safer reactors were developed.

Last year, Unit 1 became the face of a potential revival of the nuclear power industry when Microsoft and Constellation, Unit 1’s owner, announced a deal to restart the plant.

Nuclear energy is one of the options large technology companies like Microsoft are considering to help power the vast networks of data centers needed to provide all kinds of computing services, from social media to artificial intelligence. Google and Amazon have also signed deals with nuclear operators and developers.

Attitudes toward nuclear power have softened in the United States, and it has political support among both Republicans and Democrats. The industry’s supporters have said that the U.S. regulatory system drives up the cost of construction. China has leapfrogged the United States in nuclear power, and while it has similar safety standards, its approval system is more predictable.

The Trump administration has said it wants to reduce regulations at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which certifies that a reactor is safe before it is built. President Trump signed an executive order in May directing the agency to take no more than 18 months to approve applications for new reactors.

The Three Mile Island restart project would “help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement on Tuesday. Constellation said the loan has “made it possible for us to vastly expedite this restart without compromising quality or safety.”

Under the deal to revive the plant, Microsoft would buy as much power as it can from the plant for 20 years in an effort to add carbon-free electricity to the grids that power its operations.

Neither Constellation nor the Energy Department provided details of the loan or its terms. But Constellation said the loan would help it secure cheaper financing. The revived plant, named the Crane Clean Energy Center, is expected to come online in 2027, pending approvals from regulators, the company said in September. With 500 full-time employees, the site is 80 percent staffed, it said.

Once online, the 835-megawatt reactor will produce enough electricity to power roughly 800,000 homes, according to the Energy Department.

In addition to the technical challenges of restarting a mothballed nuclear plant, there are lingering safety concerns. In August 2024, about a dozen people opposed to the plant’s reopening protested outside its gates.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/19/multimedia/19xp-nuclear-gzvf/19xp-nuclear-gzvf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:32.927223

Along with a new power grid system, he said the country was in the midst of a “comprehensive green transition of social economic development”.
As in many countries, Wang suggested there was some resistance to change, but the president had sent a clear signal about the direction of travel.
It is responsible for more than 30% of global emissions.
The lack of a strong public alliance between the EU and China leaves a gap in global climate diplomacy.","China is committed to the energy transition needed to avert climate breakdown – but does not want to take the lead alone in the absence of the US, one of the country’s senior advisers has told the Guardian.

Wang Yi said China would provide more money to vulnerable countries, but the EU’s climate commissioner has warned Beijing is not doing enough to cut emissions.

“I don’t think China would like to play a leadership role alone,” said Wang, the vice-chair of China’s expert panel on climate change. “The most important thing is how to maintain momentum. Now we have two possible directions: one, we go forward with clearer, more ambitious targets. The other may be going back.

“So that’s why China would like to do our best to steer in this kind of direction towards low-carbon or green transition, but in cooperation with other countries. We don’t want to take the lead alone. We need comprehensive leadership.”

In an exclusive interview, Wang said theChinese president, Xi Jinping, was committed to the energy transition for the long haul despite resistance from some industrial sectors. He explained that China’s priority in Belém was to help the Brazilian presidency achieve a successful climate conference, and to show the benefits of multilateral decision-making. On Tuesday, the first draft of a possible agreement was published at the Cop30 summit, reviving the hotly contested plan to transition away from fossil fuels.

China is the planet’s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide from burning of coal, oil and gas, but it is now also a world leader in the production, installation and export of wind turbines, solar panels and electric cars.

He said China wanted to “speed up and scale up its efforts to provide more global public goods” despite serious geopolitical and economic tensions and unilateral barriers to trade, including tariffs. The country’s emissions have been flat or falling for 18 months.

He estimated China’s per capita power consumption would continue to grow from 7,000 kilowatt hours in 2024 to “well over 10,000, maybe 12,000” – but there would be a steady move away from fossil fuels to wind and solar, as well as green hydrogen, green ammonia and electric vehicles. Along with a new power grid system, he said the country was in the midst of a “comprehensive green transition of social economic development”.

As in many countries, Wang suggested there was some resistance to change, but the president had sent a clear signal about the direction of travel. “Even in China, we have a lot of industrial conflict ... but the central government, including President Xi, is very clear to us that we must, in the next five years’ time, speed up the new power system.”

In the absence of the US, China’s role is even more crucial than usual to the success or failure of Cop30, where the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has urged his negotiators to lay the foundations for an exit ramp out of the fossil fuel era.

Wang, who is an ecological economist and standing member of China’s state congress, said a roadmap would be challenging – particularly if it tried to impose a single set of criteria. “I think it’s very difficult. We cannot have a unified pathway for a phasedown or phaseout,” he said. “Different countries, based on different conditions, have different strategies and different transition pathways.”

He added that Trump’s second term would have a bigger impact than his first because the US had adopted more aggressive anti-climate policies. He also noted that the European Union was distracted by the war in Ukraine and economic problems.

After Trump’s imposition of hefty tariffs, Wang said progress on spreading green technology was being slowed by trade barriers, which particularly affected developing nations. He was also concerned about the high price of carbon in Europe: “I think some countries have double standards. On the one hand, they want China to speed up, to reduce our emissions, to take the lead, but on the other hand, they worry about China’s competitive capacity and also very important, maybe security … because there are very high ratios of China’s products.”

Despite the considerable gap between nations’ plans to cut emissions and what is needed to hold temperatures to 1.5C, he said China did not want to discuss targets at this Cop summit.

On the crucial issue of climate finance, Wang urged Europe and other early industrial nations to step up to the goal of providing $1.3tn (£988bn) for poorer nations to move their economies away from fossil fuels – and adapt to the growing threat of droughts, floods, extreme heat and more violent storms.

Wealthier countries have argued that China is now rich enough to make a contribution. Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner for the EU, said China needed to take more responsibility for cutting carbon, adding: “China is by far the world’s largest emitter; according to the UN it is an upper middle income country. It is responsible for more than 30% of global emissions.

“So at the moment China is not doing what science expects it to do – that has effects way beyond China itself. That is why we would hope to see more Chinese ambition going forward.”

He said the EU had made a strong diplomatic push to forge common interests with China on climate issues at a series of meetings this year. But the trading bloc has angered Beijing with a tariff that penalises imports of high-carbon goods such as steel coming from countries with inadequate policies in place to cut emissions. The lack of a strong public alliance between the EU and China leaves a gap in global climate diplomacy.

Wang said China was planning to increase its financial contributions to the global south, and that the government’s draft five-year plan mentioned the provision of “more global public goods”.

The Brazilian presidency of Cop30 has begun the process of releasing iterations of draft decision texts on all of the topics under discussion. The most closely watched is the “mutirao decision” which takes in contentious issues on which there is so far little agreement: finance, transparency, trade and the fact that countries’ emissions-cutting plans fall drastically short of the stringent cuts needed to limit global heating to 1.5C, a goal of the Paris agreement.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b5fe3cbd5867a0282002ee55f5682277a45e626/291_0_7549_6040/master/7549.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e240ecfdb09de1bbddc8c96f783b6075",N,,2025-11-19 11:06:24.834003

ERCOT battery profits drop as market saturation reshapes Texas storage

After the gold rush, operators pivot as profits slide

CALGARY, Alberta (Nov. 19, 2025) Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, the most trusted energy SaaS company that leverages generative AI across its solutions, is releasing its latest analysis on the ERCOT battery energy storage system (BESS) market, highlighting the dramatic shift in profitability and operator strategies as battery saturation transforms the Texas power landscape.

Average annual revenue for batteries in ERCOT has dropped sharply from $149 per kilowatt in 2023 to just $17 per kilowatt projected for 2025. The share of ancillary services in BESS revenue has fallen from 84% to 48% over the same period, forcing operators to pivot away from traditional strategies and adapt to a rapidly changing market.

“ERCOT’s battery market has reached a critical turning point. As saturation drives down profitability, operators must evolve beyond ancillary services and embrace sophisticated strategies to remain viable,” said Juan Arteaga, PhD, principal analyst at EIR.

Key takeaways:

ERCOT’s installed BESS capacity surged to 11 gigawatts by mid-2025, with batteries delivering more than 7 gigawatt-hours during peak demand.

Market saturation has driven ancillary service prices down, with average annual battery revenue collapsing nearly 90% in two years.

Profitability among operators now depends more on strategic site selection, operational timing, and energy market optimization, rather than fleet size or scale.

Energy arbitrage strategies have become widespread, but have not offset declining returns, with most major operators posting year-to-date profitability below 2.2%.

Future market success will require advanced approaches as ERCOT transitions to Real-Time Co-optimization plus Batteries (RTC+B), making service selection and timing increasingly critical.

Chicago, IL – November 19, 2025 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Bloom Energy BE, OPAL Fuels OPAL and FuelCell Energy FCEL.

Industry: Alt-Energy

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2792288/3-alternative-energy-stocks-to-watch-amid-near-term-challenges

A strong outlook for wind energy installations is poised to support alternative energy stocks. However, escalating turbine costs, along with U.S. tariffs and recent policy shifts, may temper their momentum, especially as the One Big Beautiful Act remains a significant obstacle. Even so, accelerating transportation electrification is expected to fuel substantial near-term growth in the U.S. electric vehicle market, providing a meaningful boost to clean energy stocks. The forerunners in the U.S. alternative energy industry are Bloom Energy, OPAL Fuels and FuelCell Energy.

About the Industry

The Zacks Alternative Energy- Other industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies. While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind, natural gas, biofuel, hydro and geothermal, the other is engaged in the development, design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources.

The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions, which have gained popularity as affordable, clean energy options lately. Per the BloombergNEF report, published in September 2025, renewable energy investments set another record in the first half of 2025, rising 10% year over year to $386 billion. With similar or more investments expected in the coming years, the industry boasts solid growth opportunities for its participants.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Alternative Energy Industry

Wind Energy – A Major Driver of Growth: Wind energy is expanding quickly, supported by favorable policies, rising climate awareness, and its affordability as a renewable power source. Wind power is one of the lowest-cost energy sources, and ongoing technological improvements have enhanced its competitiveness against conventional fuels.

Larger and more efficient turbines are delivering significantly higher output, improving overall project performance and profitability. These factors have created a strong market for wind energy. A recent Wood Mackenzie report has highlighted the sector’s rapid acceleration, projecting that the global wind industry will reach its second terawatt of capacity by 2030. According to the same report, global additions are expected to hit a record 170 GW in 2025, with more than 70 GW projected in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly build ever.

Wood Mackenzie also expects about 9.1 GW of wind additions per year over the next five years, totaling 46 GW by 2029 and cumulative wind capacity is projected to reach 196.5 GW. Together, these trends underscore a strong growth outlook for the U.S. wind sector, supporting broader expansion across the alternative energy industry.

EV Market Surge to Accelerate Clean Energy Adoption: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key force in reducing transportation-related emissions. Expanding EV charging infrastructure, government subsidies, tax credits, grants, and perks such as carpool-lane access, is prompting more U.S. consumers to transition from gasoline models to EVs. Meanwhile, lower battery costs are driving further growth in the U.S. EV market.

According to Electric Cars Report, in the third quarter of 2025, U.S. EV sales shattered all previous records, hitting an all-time high of 438,487 EVs. It surged 40.7% sequentially and was up 29.6% from the prior-year level. Per a report by Statista, the EV market in the United States is projected to reach revenues of $105.8 billion in 2025. It is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2025-2030) of 8.57%, resulting in a projected market volume of $159.7 billion by 2030. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Increasing Costs Driven by Tariffs and OBBA: Escalating renewable installation costs have become a major hurdle for clean energy developers. In particular, higher steel prices, critical for manufacturing large wind turbine components, have recently pushed wind installation expenses even higher. Adding to the pressure, the U.S. government’s elevated import tariffs, introduced in early 2025, have further increased cost burdens across the wind sector.

According to a Wood Mackenzie report, tariffs and policy uncertainty have posed significant challenges for the market, causing a 50% decrease in turbine orders in the first half of 2025 compared to that a year ago, taking them to their lowest level since 2020. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027.

To this end, it can be said that the expiration of tax credits drives project costs up far more than tariffs. Since these credits significantly reduce expenses, their expiration makes renewable energy development and production much more expensive.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #142, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 243 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry’s bottom-line estimate for the current fiscal year has moved down 15.4% to $2.04 since June 30.

Before we present a few alternative energy stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation.

Independent testing confirms that its advanced Sigma Pyrolysis system eliminates 99.98% of PFAS compounds across all waste streams, including biosolids, discharge water, and exhaust gases.

This achievement marks the most comprehensive validation of the system’s performance to date.

Extensive testing confirms high efficiency

The rigorous study, conducted by engineering experts at Brown and Caldwell, involved sampling at eight points throughout the Bioforcetech process.

Results revealed that the thermal oxidizer, located before the exhaust scrubbing stage, is where the majority of PFAS destruction occurs. This highlights the system’s carefully optimised design and operating conditions as key to achieving near-complete removal.

The testing builds on previous evaluations, including internal assessments by Bioforcetech and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies.

Advanced analytical methods were used for each phase of the process: EPA 1633A for solids, OTM 45 for exhaust gases, and high-sensitivity tests conducted in partnership with North Carolina State University.

The combined results confirmed that just 0.02% of PFAS compounds remain anywhere in the system, demonstrating unprecedented effectiveness in removing these persistent chemicals.

Transforming waste into value

Beyond PFAS elimination, Bioforcetech’s pyrolysis process converts treated biosolids into a sustainable, value-added product called OurCarbon®.

Testing verified that all PFAS originally present in both wet and dry biosolids are fully removed from this end product.

This dual benefit – creating PFAS-free outputs while generating a usable carbon material – positions Bioforcetech’s technology as a game-changer for wastewater treatment facilities seeking environmentally responsible solutions.

Dario Presezzi, CEO of Bioforcetech, added: “This milestone further drives the proof that pyrolysis of biosolids is a clear solution for the PFAS problem.

“The results from this testing give Bioforcetech even further confidence in our thermal process to alleviate wastewater plants of their biosolids burden and produce a value-added output product.”

A new standard in wastewater management

Bioforcetech’s success with PFAS removal offers a promising pathway for municipalities and industrial facilities struggling with the environmental and regulatory challenges of PFAS contamination.

The combination of thermal treatment and sustainable resource creation demonstrates that it is possible to protect water and air quality while producing valuable byproducts.

As PFAS continues to threaten communities worldwide, innovations like Bioforcetech’s pyrolysis system are paving the way for safer, more sustainable, and circular approaches to managing biosolids and other waste streams.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2358492255.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 12:06:37.223550

As the U.S. retreats from global climate efforts, it’s easy to focus on the negative. Yet most companies and investors aren’t just maintaining their sustainability commitments — they’re accelerating them.

New research indicates that the private sector is forging ahead. A Harvard Business Review analysis of 75 global companies found 53 percent are holding steady on sustainability commitments, 32 percent are expanding on them — and just 8 percent are retreating. According to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the adoption of science-based targets continues to accelerate, with the number of companies setting near-term targets doubling and those committing to net-zero targets tripling in the past 18 months.

Next, follow the money. Globally, clean energy and grid investments are projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025 — twice the amount expected to flow into fossil fuels. Despite the U.S. federal government’s dismantling of policies supporting clean energy, S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates that clean energy will keep growing at a strong clip in the U.S. through 2030. Clean energy stocks are soaring — the S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index gained 44 percent over the past year, significantly outpacing fossil fuels, with the S&P 1500 Oil & Gas Drilling Sub-Industry Index dropping 17 percent.

Blue-chip companies lead the way

Companies and investors we work with are taking strong public action. For instance, this year, General Mills updated its Climate Transition Action Plan, sharpening the action around four climate levers, from agriculture to transportation, first identified in last year’s plan to help meet its goals of cutting emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. With a strong focus on assessment, policy, governance and human rights, the updated plan underscores General Mills’ commitment to transparency and collaboration.

Corporate water action is also gaining ground. Our latest Valuing Water Finance Initiative benchmark shows that two-thirds of companies improved their performance since 2023. Danone, Gap, Microsoft and PepsiCo lead the way in the four major industries we assessed, making advances on several fronts to reduce their impact on water and strengthen resilience. This is in line with expectations of the initiative, which is the only investor-led global effort focused on water action.

The role of investment and advocacy

With COP30 in the Brazilian Amazon putting the spotlight on protecting forests and other natural ecosystems, Nature Action 100 is proving how quickly investors can mobilize for change. Since its launch two years ago, the world’s first and largest global investor-led initiative on nature and biodiversity loss has expanded to over 240 investor participants, underscoring the growing recognition that nature’s resilience is essential to safeguarding the global economy.

And then there’s advocacy. For all the talk that companies are afraid to speak out in this political environment, they continue to do the important work of pushing for climate and clean energy policy. We saw dozens upon dozens of major companies and investors head to Capitol Hill throughout 2025 to champion and defend federal clean energy incentives, advanced manufacturing investment and good-paying jobs.

This fall, we watched more than 40 business entities rally in support of reauthorizing California’s nation-leading cap-and-invest program. That’s a timely reminder about the opportunity for states to set policy and provide leadership. And late last month, leading companies in Illinois successfully backed the passage of one of the most important affordability wins of the year — model legislation for reducing electricity costs, modernizing infrastructure and delivering clean energy.

Stay focused despite the headwinds

Now, I am very clear-eyed about the current headwinds. At a time of global economic change, when the U.S. has every incentive to lead in clean industries and technologies, the federal government is actively obstructing progress on clean energy and competitiveness. Meanwhile, special interests are waging a politically-driven campaign to force investors to ignore climate risks, introducing hundreds of state laws to control private investment strategy.

But despite all of this obstructionism, companies are acting and investment is flowing. Because sustainability is good for business and essential for long-term value creation and global competitiveness. The only affordable path for meeting America’s surging energy demand is through clean, American-made power.

A decade after the Paris Agreement, while we’ve fallen short of our most ambitious emissions goals, we must recognize the progress we’ve made. We avoided the UN’s projected estimate of up to 7.8 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century and the Rhodium Group estimates that warming is highly unlikely to exceed 3.9 degrees by 2100 and could be limited to 2 degrees. Every single tenth of a degree of warming counts.

So stay focused. Make the case through advocacy, investment, or transition plans that clean energy is essential to economic growth and energy security as power demand and prices continue to rise. Just last month, JPMorgan’s global head of sustainable solutions underscored this point, warning that the U.S. will struggle to meet the energy demands of its rapidly expanding tech sector without wind and solar.

Trust science and market forces

Around the world, the momentum behind a sustainable, clean energy economy is undeniable and unstoppable. It’s propelled by potent market and geopolitical forces including accelerating competition, rising energy demand, the global race for energy security, and the need to cut pollution and safeguard natural resources that businesses rely on. Politics will shift, but physics and market forces won’t.

Act globally. International cooperation, coupled with private sector action, is an economic imperative to prevent escalating financial risks. A new Ceres analysis shows that five key drivers of nature loss could cost eight global sectors up to $430 billion each year. Yet, government and business action are already fueling economic and job growth, innovation and investment worldwide.

I’m an optimist, precisely because of the 35-plus years Ceres has spent driving home the business case for sustainability. Now is the moment to focus on how far we’ve come, how much we’ve learned and how much we have to gain — and lose.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trellis_editorial_climate_commitment_1470x894.png,N,,2025-11-19 11:04:36.553231

And there, underlying the lush forests and riverbeds of East Texas, sits the Carrizo-Wilcox — a big, juicy pig, with no one standing guard.
Sitting on top of a gold mine doesn’t mean that every resident of East Texas could be about to strike it rich.
“We cannot compromise one region for another,” State Representative Cecil Bell said to another packed room, this time at the Texas State Capitol in Austin.
High-quality monitoring could give the groundwater conservation districts the data they need to say no to big projects that are deemed unsustainable.","The farmers and ranchers who descended on city hall in Jacksonville, Texas, had been told to “leave their pitchforks at the door.” While everyone ultimately arrived unarmed, the attendees of the June 19 board meeting of the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District were ready for a fight.

In the hallway outside the boardroom, wives tried to cool their husbands with handheld paper fans that flapped uselessly amid a sea of silver hair — stoic men with sweat-slicked brows beneath weathered cowboy hats, veterans’ insignia, and red MAGA ball caps. Near the chamber door, a uniformed officer stood sweating through his shirt, trying to enforce the fire marshal’s 150-person limit while the crowd swelled behind him. The sign-in table, barely visible through the crush, had already collected nearly 100 names — almost all were there to speak out against the water permits requested by two shadowy LLCs tied to hedge fund manager Kyle Bass and his investment group, Conservation Equity Management Partners.

The permit applications submitted by Bass’ Redtown Ranch Holdings LLC and Pine Bliss LLC collectively request permission to withdraw approximately 15 billion gallons of water annually from the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer in East Texas, an amount residents fear will run their wells and farms dry. Without taking off their “Don’t Tread On Me” t-shirts, the citizens of six East Texas counties where Trump took around 80 percent of the vote last November are now turning to their state government to protect them from billionaires.

Jacksonville sits about two hours southeast of Dallas. With a population just shy of 15,000, it’s the largest city in Cherokee County, one of the three counties represented by the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District. The trees in the county are lush and tall, and the Neches and Trinity Rivers gently flood the landscape with a predictability that local farmers use to their advantage. The county’s tight-knit residents typically vote Republican, they’ve told me over the years, to protect their freedom from government overreach. But as they watch water conflicts breaking out all over Texas, they feel their communities are being overwhelmed by heavy industry and profiteering. Some locals have started making the case that it’s not government overreach for the state to step in when the fight’s not fair.

Melisa Meador, who identified herself as a wife, mother, Christian, and pecan farmer with 600 acres near Bass’s Redtown Ranch — one of the LLCs looking to pump groundwater — took a prophetic tone in her testimony to the conservation district board. “Those who endlessly accumulate sow the seeds of their own destruction,” Meador said at the podium with the cadence and poetry of a revivalist. “Today’s water barons join river to river, well to well, until all water flows through their meters. Their thirst for profit can never be quenched.”

For his part, Bass feels he’s being mischaracterized. “I’m not coming at this as a robber baron, and I’m not coming at this as someone who intends to do any harm whatsoever,” he told me in the hall after taking a break from being public enemy number one inside the Jacksonville boardroom. “If they come back to me and say, ‘You’re going to do harm, you need to reduce your permit,’ I’m a very reasonable person.”

He’s not shy about his intentions for the water, though he insists that he does not already have buyers lined up. The water, should he get it, could be transported out of East Texas to any number of bone-dry cities west of the Carrizo-Wilcox. Unless the government wants to hang a “closed for business sign on I-35,” he said, there has to be some solution to the statewide water shortage. Really, he said, the amount of water he’s talking about exporting is a drop in the bucket — less than 1 percent of what the state needs.

“I mean, we’re talking about a large amount of water in this area, but a very small amount of water as it relates to the state,” Bass said. “The state has a real problem.”

He’s right. Droughts have always been part of Texas weather, but with climate change, they’ve grown longer and hotter. Meanwhile, increasingly unpredictable torrents of rain are flooding canyons and tributaries, but doing little to refill the aquifers under parched, hard land.

West Texas is getting drier, heading toward all-out catastrophe for high desert cities and the state’s treasured spring-fed rivers. The Panhandle and Gulf Coast are scrambling for new water sources as agriculture and industry outpace local basins and aquifers. As drought conditions persist, the primary urban corridor, Interstate 35, has boomed with massive, thirsty tech companies that exhaust local water supplies in metropolis-adjacent exurbs. And the Edwards Aquifer — the massive limestone tank under southwest Texas — cannot support more growth, rendering San Antonio desperate for imported water. Like ravenous wolves, the thirsty cities are on the prowl for water. And there, underlying the lush forests and riverbeds of East Texas, sits the Carrizo-Wilcox — a big, juicy pig, with no one standing guard.

San Antonio struck first, running its 140-mile Vista Ridge pipeline and pulling 16 billion gallons per year from the Carrizo-Wilcox, causing wells in some rural counties to sputter. Fast-growing Austin suburbs also began sinking proverbial straws in their surrounding counties, laying pipe to keep up with exploding development. In Lee County, just east of Austin, the San Francisco-based water asset management firm Upwell Water announced plans to build a pipeline so big that the cities of Bryan and College Station, along with Texas A&M University, jointly filed suit to stop what they see as a groundwater grab.

There’s more to the pipeline-palooza than just competition for scarce resources. There are also fortunes to be made. Conservationists, well drillers, and even industry insiders have started comparing the rush on the Carrizo-Wilcox to the oil frenzy of the Texas Permian Basin or the California gold rush. But this time, the boomtowns won’t spring up next to the pumps. The real fortunes — and the real growth — are happening hundreds of miles away, in cities that may never lay eyes on the rural wells quenching their thirst.

Sitting on top of a gold mine doesn’t mean that every resident of East Texas could be about to strike it rich. The infrastructure to pump and export billions of gallons of water is more than most farmers and ranchers could afford — so they can’t drain their own land. Nor will water exporters need to pay them top dollar for their largest tracts. All an exporter needs is a couple of acres and some antiquated property rights.

In Texas, landowners enjoy the “rule of capture,” a doctrine based in Roman and Old English law giving them the right to harvest whatever groundwater flows under their property, even if it causes problems for their neighbors. This regularly did cause problems between neighbors — especially if one neighbor was an industrial farmer — so in 1940, Texas established groundwater conservation districts to serve mostly as monitors and arbiters. As regulatory bodies, they are ill equipped to impose strong enough penalties to stop an operation like Bass’. District boundaries often follow county lines, a demarcation which, many have pointed out, means nothing to the water flowing below. If the district tells you no in one county, you can just go next door.

Some in Texas, including some Republican lawmakers, would like to see that change. Following the June 19 meeting in Jacksonville, the Neches & Trinity Valleys Groundwater Conservation District ultimately opted to kick Bass’s permit request to the State Office of Administrative Hearings, a referee in complex regulatory fights that’s intended to give citizens, companies, and government entities a legal forum for high-stakes disputes — like who gets to pump 15 billion gallons of East Texas groundwater. The hearing has yet to be scheduled, in part because of lawsuits filed by many of the people and businesses who could be affected. But the outcry in Jacksonville sparked a growing awareness that every single Texas politician represents one of two kinds of places: districts that need water, or those that stand to lose it.

“We cannot compromise one region for another,” State Representative Cecil Bell said to another packed room, this time at the Texas State Capitol in Austin. The House Natural Resources Committee convened on July 15 specifically to talk about Bass’ permits, but found themselves wrestling with the statewide dilemma as well. The 11-hour hearing was like a marble and brass version of the Jacksonville meeting, complete with air conditioning problems in the Capitol annex. Many of those who showed up in cowboy hats to Jacksonville were now in suits and ties. In addition to the 13 members of the committee, six state representatives and two state senators stayed seated on the dais until nearly midnight — a startling show of interest in a topic usually delegated to staffers and lobbyists.

That night, several expert witnesses and more than one state representative suggested that it might be time to rethink the rule of capture and move toward a more modern means of regulation that can balance the needs of neighbors and water systems across the state. But property rights in Texas are sacrosanct, and folks in rural Texas don’t necessarily trust the government — even the one they voted for — to regulate in their favor.

Industry veteran Johnnie Parker, owner of a wastewater cleaning company near the area Bass wants to pump, attended the hearing in Austin — he was one of the few attendees who’d stuck with jeans and a ball cap instead of a suit — and expressed doubts about whether the Legislature or even the State Office of Administrative Hearings would ever side with rural East Texas. “To me it’s a circus when it comes to these hearings and what not … there’s a lot of things that happen behind closed doors that the general public doesn’t get to see,” Parker said, sitting on a bench in the vaulted, echoing hallway outside the hearing. He rubbed his fingers together to indicate the power of money. “Until the Legislature gets together and decides they want to change the laws on how these things are regulated, this is just a smoke screen.”

Most of the testimony indicated that regulation should fall to the groundwater conservation districts, which would need “more teeth” to protect their jurisdictions. That might be the most politically feasible way forward. The Legislature this year already raised the maximum fine allowed for overpumping, from $10,000 to $25,000. It also considered a bill to increase funding for groundwater research, which could help develop tools for better real-time monitoring of water levels in high-demand aquifers like the Carrizo-Wilcox. High-quality monitoring could give the groundwater conservation districts the data they need to say no to big projects that are deemed unsustainable. Additional legislation could help those denials hold up in court when property owners dispute them.

Representative Cody Harris represents most of the area where Bass wants to pump and also happens to chair the Texas House Natural Resources Committee. After the hearing, he filed two bills in the special legislative sessions Texas convened in July and August — one bill to prohibit water exports from East Texas and another to fund a study of the Carrizo-Wilcox to determine just how vulnerable it is to over-pumping. The clock ran out on both bills, but Harris feels confident they will fare well in the 2027 Legislature, which many expect to be dominated by water issues.

But the Austin hearing underscored an uneasy feeling growing in some rural communities. While the science and governance of millions and billions of gallons were extensively debated, barely a question was asked about the millions and billions of dollars to be made selling that water. Back in Jacksonville, speaker after speaker had scoffed at the idea that Bass would walk away from profit if it hurt his rural neighbors. But in Austin, it was only Parker, out in the hall, talking about the influence money would have on the future of water in Texas. For him and others raising concerns, the water wars are the latest example illuminating the power big money can wield over politics when regulation — usually anathema to free-market conservatism — isn’t strong enough to keep it in check.

This tension between political principle and existential threat was evident back in Jacksonville at the hearing on June 19, when Miria Dean — who lives two miles from Redtown Ranch — chatted with others who’d arrived too late or given up trying to get on the list of speakers inside. She told me she saw Bass’ plans as “greed, pure and simple.” What’s legal and what’s right aren’t always the same, she said. Then she paused, smiled, and added, “Happy Juneteenth, right?” We regarded each other, both taking in the significance of the holiday that happened to coincide with the hearing. Slavery was once legal in this country, but it had never been right.

When I asked who should intervene to stop Bass, Dean recoiled at the idea of big government. But her stance was more complex than that. “We still want the government’s hands off. We don’t want their nose in our business. We want them to step in, but only as far as we want them to step.”

Even capitalism, the guiding ethos of small government, is no longer a free pass. “Capitalism is a great thing,” one speaker said at the Jacksonville hearing. “Unfettered capitalism is bad.” The crowd applauded.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Texas-aquifers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-19 06:57:38.381057

The oil can coat feathers and fur of wildlife, poison marine life and destroy sensitive habitats like coral reefs and mangroves.

Different types of technology can be used to prevent and treat oil spills, helping to protect ecosystems and recover as much oil as possible.

Energy Digital has ranked 10 of the top oil spill response technologies.

10. Autonomous surface vessels

Leading company: Sea Machines Robotics

Founder & CEO: Michael G. Johnson

HQ: Boston, Massachusetts, US

In 2019, Sea Machines Robotics successfully deployed the industry’s first autonomous spill-response vessel.

The autonomous systems are placed on skimmer boats and can be controlled remotely to deploy on-board booms, skimmer belts and other equipment.

It can be operated in an unmanned autonomous mode, allowing operators to respond to spill events without exposing crewmembers to challenging weather or toxic fumes.

The vessel has the potential to increase the safety, productivity and predictability of response for marine oil spill operations.

9. Drones and aerial surveillance

Leading company: Chevron

CEO: Mike Wirth

HQ: Houston, Texas, US

A remotely monitored drone – called an AiRanger – can help inspect oil and gas pipelines.

Chevron, working together with American Aerospace Technologies, Inc. (AATI), became the first companies permitted to use these uncrewed aircrafts by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The AiRanger has a wingspan of 18 feet, making it larger than a traditional drone but smaller than a piloted plane.

It can fly for 12 hours which is more than twice as long as other types of aircraft, providing real-time reports of any threats and risks in Chevron’s pipelines which could lead to spills.

8. X-band radar-based detection

Leading company: Petrobras

CEO: Magda Chambriard

HQ: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Brazil’s environmental agency reached an agreement with Petrobras in 2018, encouraging the company to expand its oil spill detection operations in the Campos Basin near Rio de Janeiro.

Ocean monitoring company Miros Group provided Petrobras with oil spill surveillance technology.

The system provides continuous automatic oil spill detection using x-band radar, thermal imaging, vessel tracking and infrared cameras.

It can help to accurately detect oil spills early on, allowing Petrobras to respond to the spills and recover as much oil as possible.

7. Satellite monitoring technology

Leading company: Saudi Aramco

CEO: Amin H. Nasser

HQ: Dhahran, Saudi Arabia

Petroleum and natural gas company Saudi Aramco has introduced satellite technology to help detect marine oil spills.

This is to help protect coral reefs, due to the threat oil spills pose to the economy and the environment.

The satellite features Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors (SAR) that provide high-resolution images that allow oil slicks to be identified due to disrupted ocean backscatter.

Aramco’s technology can help make informed decisions to safeguard people, assets and the natural environment.

It provides advantages including rapid spill identification, real-time imagery for spill impact management and threat assessments.

6. Sorbents

Leading company: Sorbcontrol

General Manager: Juan Francisco Pozzi

HQ: Barcelona, Spain

Sorbents are materials that soak up oil while repelling water, removing the last traces of oil that mechanical methods usually miss.

Sorbcontrol specialises in designing and producing a variety of oil spill solutions, including sorbents. The company says it has worked with businesses including Repsol.

It provides sorbents that can treat both marine and industrial spills, with sorbents that can absorb only hydrocarbons or those that absorb all liquids, including chemicals and water.

Juan Francisco Pozzi, General Manager at Sorbcontrol, said on LinkedIn: “Seeing our solutions in action reinforces our commitment to helping teams tackle environmental challenges head-on and protect our oceans.”

5. Subsea containment and recovery systems

Leading company: Ambipar

CEO: Tercio Borlenghi Jr.

HQ: London, UK

Offshore containment aims to capture and collect oil directly from the source of the leak, before sending it to surface vessels for removal.

If successfully deployed, offshore containment can prevent the majority of leaking oil from reaching the environment.

Companies like Ambipar offer equipment that can be rented out to tackle oil spills.

Its containment package includes a 10 foot container, offshore boom and hydraulic hoses, while its recovery package includes an offshore skimmer and a transfer pump.

4. Capping stacks

Leading company: Shell

CEO: Wael Sawan

HQ: London, UK

The Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) was founded by Shell and other global oil and gas leaders to better prepare the industry for deepwater well control incidents.

This initiative is designed for subsea well containment, featuring equipment including capping stacks.

A capping stack is placed over a well to shut it in and stop the flow of oil and gas, containing any spills and mitigating environmental damage.

The equipment is designed to be quickly transported to an incident site and lowered to the well, where its valves can be closed to contain oil.

3. Chemical dispersants

Leading company: bp

CEO: Murray Auchincloss

HQ: London, UK

bp extensively used dispersants during the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, which was one of the biggest oil spills in history.

Chemical dispersants are used to mitigate the impact of an oil spill from coating shorelines and harming coastal wildlife.

During the incident, bp applied chemical dispersants on the surface of the water using aircrafts and directly into the well at the source of the spill.

Dispersants work by breaking down oil into smaller drops that can more easily mix with the water, which helps remove it from the surface of the ocean.

To be fully effective, chemical dispersants must be added into the water quickly after an oil spill has taken place.

2. Oil skimmers

Leading company: Enbridge

CEO: Gregory Ebel

HQ: Calgary, Canada

Enbridge uses different types of oil skimmers for both industrial cleaning and emergency oil spill response.

One type of skimmer is an oleophilic (oil-attracting) skimmer, which is used to lift oil from the surface of the water.

These can be belt skimmers which use a continuous belt and wiper blessed to scrape oil into a container, or mop skimmers which use a series of mops to blot oil from the water.

Enbridge also employs tube skimmers, using a floating horizontal tube to collect oil which is then stripped off and drained into a collection vessel.

Despite having strict oil spill response measures, the company says it believes that all incidents can be prevented.

It aims to limit the environmental impact of spills by working to contain the oil, prevent further damage and protect nearby wildlife.

1. Containment booms

Leading company: ExxonMobil

CEO: Darren Woods

HQ: Houston, Texas, US

The Valdez oil spill took place in 1989 and was one of the biggest learning experiences in ExxonMobil’s history.

The company took immediate responsibility for the spill and worked to clean it up using technology like containment booms.

Containment booms are temporary floating barriers used to contain oil on the surface of water to prevent it from spreading.

In the oil spill, ExxonMobil first focused on protecting nearby salmon hatcheries by deploying booms between the oil and the salmon streams.

After oil was contained by the booms, it was removed by skimmers and other treatments.

Containment booms are very commonly used to treat oil spills thanks to their high effectiveness in various weather conditions including wind and storms.

Darren Woods, CEO and Chairman of ExxonMobil, says: “We have a philosophy to be the most responsible operator in our industry.

“For as long as there’s a demand for oil and gas, you want the most responsible companies producing that.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a61ec1f2fc0d1b35bcd7fdaff404487c:356a89f49bb7c6947238ba30f6420443/energy-top10-graphics-cms-oil-spill-response-technologies.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 06:00:23.573476

In North Carolina, health care providers cannot expand services — be it new MRI machines, hospital beds, operating rooms — unless they are filling a pre-identified need.
DHHS identifies these needs by looking at population numbers, demographics and utilization of various health care facilities, services and equipment to see what local area needs what.
Briner believes those inflated prices are part of the reason the state health plan is so broke.
Lawyers also emphasized how CON supports the affordability and equitable geographic distribution of health care services.","RALEIGH — A three-judge panel heard cases for and against the constitutionality of North Carolina’s Certificate of Need law on Tuesday, pulling the central health care regulation in the state into question. The judges gave no timeline for when to expect their decision.

The constitutionality challenge began with one doctor’s fight to perform surgeries at his ophthalmology practice in Craven County.

When New Bern ophthalmologist Jay Singleton wanted to dedicate a room to provide more complex, invasive procedures, the state told him it was illegal. Why? The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services hadn’t identified a “need” for more operating room capacity in New Bern.

In North Carolina, health care providers cannot expand services — be it new MRI machines, hospital beds, operating rooms — unless they are filling a pre-identified need. DHHS identifies these needs by looking at population numbers, demographics and utilization of various health care facilities, services and equipment to see what local area needs what. Health care providers then apply to meet those needs.

Carolina Public Press published a full explainer on the law last year.

Because of CON, Singleton was relegated to performing his surgeries at the local hospital, instead of expanding capacity at his clinic.

Singleton took DHHS to court over the law, arguing it stifles free-market competition. The case originally went all the way to the state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided Singleton’s case wasn’t just about his practice, but the constitutionality of the law on its face. They sent it back to the Wake County Superior Court three-judge panel that heard the case Tuesday to weigh the constitutionality questions.

Republican State Treasurer Brad Briner intervened in the case on behalf of Singleton, arguing that CON inflates health care prices. Briner believes those inflated prices are part of the reason the state health plan is so broke. The John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina-based conservative think tank, is also supporting Singleton.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, DHHS, and the Republican leaders of both the state Senate and the state House have asked the three-judge panel to dismiss the case.

Republican Judge Jeffrey Foster of Pitt County, Republican Judge Troy Stafford of Iredell County and Democratic Judge Jacqueline Grant of Buncombe County made up the panel.

A little history

If the judges rule that CON law is unconstitutional, it wouldn’t be the first time. The North Carolina Supreme Court found the state’s original CON law unconstitutional in 1973.

In 1974, Congress adopted the National Health Resources and Development Act, which strongly incentivized states to have Certificate of Need laws. President Gerald Ford signed the measure into law the following year. While not an outright mandate, the measure encouraged most states to adopt these laws. Louisiana was the lone holdout.

North Carolina approved a new CON law in 1977, which has since been revised several times through subsequent legislation, but has not faced a serious court challenge — until now.

Arguments against constitutionality

Joshua Windham of the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm based in Virginia, represented Singleton at the hearing.

Windham argued that CON law violates the North Carolina constitutional promise that each resident has the right to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. It also violates anti-monopoly and anti-exclusive privileges laws, Windham argued.

CON law tends to favor hospital systems that already have a strong foothold in the market, which is why Windham called the law a “monopolist’s dream” at the hearing. He said the law increases health care costs, reduces access to care, and harms patients. The other side, though, believes that the law decreases costs and protects access to care. It’s fairly hard to prove either side right.

Windham also argued that the law stifles competition.

“How does limiting services ever lead to lower costs?” he asked the judges.

Arguments for constitutionality

The arguments in favor of the law revolved around the idea that CON isn’t truly inhibiting Singleton’s ability to practice medicine and earn a living. Lawyers also emphasized how CON supports the affordability and equitable geographic distribution of health care services.

Derek Hunter, the lawyer representing DHHS, argued that CON ensures that rural North Carolinians do not go underserved. If there is a need, there will be a service, in a perfect application of the law. Hospitals can’t just target metropolises and avoid rural communities, where high percentages of Medicare/Medicaid recipients result in lower margins for hospitals.

Plus, Hunter said, health care is not a normal marketplace that relies on supply and demand. Competition between providers won’t necessarily drive costs down, because of price transparency issues and so many health care decisions being made under duress.

But the hearing got stuck on one unusual argument from Hunter. He argued that due to a loophole in the law, Singleton could just do whatever surgeries he pleases in his procedure rooms. He doesn’t need an operating room to do an operation.

“Dr. Singleton is free to perform any surgery he wants,” Hunter said. Just in a procedure room, not an OR.

Windham accused Hunter of bringing this “bizarre” argument in “at the eleventh hour” to “muddy the waters” and “get the case off the docket.”

As a result of Tuesday’s hearing, the panel is expected to issue a decision on the constitutionality of the law. Whatever that decision is, it’s likely to be appealed.

For their part, typical EV batteries usually have a decade-long, 100,000-mile warranty and ""rarely need replaced,"" according to Recurrent.","Italian startup Avathor has created one of the more noble ways to use end-of-life electric vehicle batteries. The company's Avathor One upgrades the aging, yet still functional, packs to power small vehicles that can carry people in wheelchairs or people who have mobility issues.

""Instead of letting end-of-life EV packs sit idle, the company is repurposing them,"" Carscoops' Thanos Pappas wrote about the innovation.

It's an invention that extends the use of expensive batteries that are chock-full of materials that often require invasive mining and processing to produce. It also shows that unlikely partners are willing to work together when it matters most.

The batteries are from Stellantis, the automaking giant with well-known brands in its portfolio. Avathor One was designed by Italdesign, which is part of competitor Volkswagen Group. It helps that all of the companies involved have key operations in Turin, where the vehicle is being developed, according to Carscoops.

And the ride lives up to its Italian roots. It's sleek and modern, resembling a vehicle from ""Tron."" A rear-side ramp allows wheelchair access. The vehicle is controlled with a joystick, has a 31-mile range, and can go about 6 mph. It also has a load of sensors, cameras, and LED lights to ensure a safe trip, according to the company website.

And if successfully rolled out — plans are to launch in Italy this year, followed by other markets — it could improve lives in more ways than one.

Aging EV batteries pose a significant environmental hazard if improperly trashed. They are a fire risk when sent to landfills and can leach toxic metals into the environment, according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

But even after 10-20 years powering EVs, the packs still have plenty of ability for service outside of the regular rigors of road travel. California's B2U Storage is using old EV batteries to store solar energy for grid support. An innovation in England has converted diesel trucks to electric power, sucking the last life out of packs as they carry them to a recycler, as other examples.

That's in addition to investments from Mercedes and others to better recycle key battery components for reuse, helping to lower pack costs and prevent harmful waste.

It's important to note that tens of millions of tons of deposits from Earth will be needed in the coming decades to power the shift to cleaner technology. So every recycled pack can reduce the need for new materials. But that load of metals and minerals is still far short of the 16.5 billion tons of dirty fuels mined from the ground each year, Sustainability by Numbers reported.

For their part, typical EV batteries usually have a decade-long, 100,000-mile warranty and ""rarely need replaced,"" according to Recurrent.

That's why making the switch to a cleaner ride is a value that provides, on average, $1,500 in savings on gas and service costs with no more oil changes. Certain states still offer a range of perks for buying and charging one. Ford's Power Promise even pays for an at-home charger and installation when you purchase or lease one of its EVs.

Importantly, each EV that replaces a gas-burning vehicle prevents thousands of pounds of planet-warming fumes, the Department of Energy reported. What's more, the Environmental Protection Agency has a laundry list of health risks associated with breathing the tailpipe exhaust, including cancer and airway damage.

Avathor One is an innovative example that extends the usefulness of cleaner technology.

But nowadays, you know, like how lots of new gas stations came — things change,” Poudel said.
City officials say the existing number of gas stations already meets the needs of Littleton’s 46,000 residents, while electric vehicle adoption continues to grow statewide.","LITTLETON, Colo. — City leaders in Littleton will extend a temporary moratorium on new gas station development, a move designed to curb emissions and accelerate the community’s shift toward cleaner transportation.

The city, which already has 24 gas stations — roughly one for every 2,000 residents — first enacted the moratorium in May. On Tuesday night, council members extended that pause another 180 days to allow time for changes to Littleton’s Unified Land Use Code.

“The City of Littleton put in place a development moratorium for Fuel Sales (Retail) uses that were not already under review on May 6, 2025,” said Jessica Bixenman, the city’s communications director. “The moratorium was established after a study session that discussed the existing number and proposed additional fuel sales locations within the city. An economic analysis of fuel sales uses was provided at the Sept. 16, 2025, City Council meeting. As a result of that meeting, City Council directed staff to extend the moratorium and draft a text amendment to the Unified Land Use Code (ULUC) focusing on where the use would be allowed and implementing additional development standards. Staff intends to hold a study session with the Planning Commission in January as a next step in completing the text amendment to the ULUC. Tonight's council action is the extension of the moratorium to complete the code amendments.”

For Puspa Poudel, who has owned Horizon Food and Gas for eight years, the pause offers some optimism amid high competition from large chains.

“When we started, it was really, really good at the beginning. But nowadays, you know, like how lots of new gas stations came — things change,” Poudel said. “When a big gas station opens right next to you, you really cannot compete much, and then it hurts your business.”

“They are purchasing inventory high, so they get the better deal. And you really cannot compete, because you already buy your purchasing price so high. I'm really, really hoping no more new builds,” she said.

City officials say the existing number of gas stations already meets the needs of Littleton’s 46,000 residents, while electric vehicle adoption continues to grow statewide.

Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said EV sales in the state have jumped in recent years.

Littleton extends pause on new gas stations as city eyes a cleaner future

“If you look back over the last year, it's varied a little bit, but it's varied between about 25 and 33% of new vehicle sales being EVs,” Toor said. “When you think of the smog and ozone problem we have in Denver and in the northern Front Range, one of the biggest things we can do to tackle that air pollution is move to electric vehicles.”

""The Energy Office really has the mission of both improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas pollution while helping to reduce consumer energy costs,"" Toor added, saying state-level tax credits have helped customers overcome initial costs. ""We think that those consumer incentives have really helped people to get past the first cost of an EV so that they can then benefit from all of those long-term fuel and maintenance savings.""

While Toor said Colorado’s market momentum for EVs is likely to continue, he noted the federal government is “certainly going in a different direction.”

“The Trump administration has turned away from electric vehicles, whether... removing vehicle emission standards that supported cleaner vehicles, including electric vehicles, or removing the federal tax credit that was $7,500 for each passenger vehicle,” Toor said. “It's a little early for us to know what the impact is going to be, but it's certainly going to make it... harder for EVs in the United States.”

“This stuff is generating astronomical amounts of money for localities,” data center developer Tom Dakich said. “We do a bad job of bringing the transparency of those numbers, and the numbers are staggering.”

Dakich, who was involved in the Digital Crossroad data center in Hammond, spoke to the Strategic Energy Growth Task Force during an afternoon meeting at the Indiana State Museum.

The industry is also doing a “bad job” talking about the “de minimus” amount of water needed for cooling the massive facilities, he said.

That’s putting some off Indiana, said Dakich, who added, “We’ve got to figure out a way to make those public officials insulated.”

Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said lawmakers have already attempted.

Legislation to take control over large-scale utility infrastructure projects decisions has failed repeatedly.

“We said, ‘Let us take responsibility, and we’ll set the standards.’ And they didn’t want that. They wanted complete control,” he said.

In November, Standing Rock Public Transit added a new electric van to its fleet, with a longer driving range than the first.","This summer, Len Necefer finally planned the road trip he’s been thinking about for nearly a decade: Going coast-to-coast in an electric vehicle, stopping only to charge on tribal lands.

As a Navajo citizen and tribal energy expert who used to work in the federal government, he saw it as the ultimate test of how far energy infrastructure had come.

Stop by stop, his plans came together until North Dakota, where a dearth of chargers seemed to prevent a Midwest crossing. Then, he spotted it: a level-2 charger at Sitting Bull College on the Standing Rock Reservation.

50 States, 50 Fixes is a series about local solutions to environmental problems. A few more to come this year.

It was more than a lucky break. Over the past three years, Standing Rock has installed chargers across the reservation as part of the Electric Nation project, a regional effort to create an intertribal charging network.

By the time the project wraps at the end of November, Standing Rock Nation will operate 13 E.V. chargers, most of them in North Dakota. While there aren’t many E.V.s in town yet, each new charger makes driving one easier than before.

“I want to show folks that this technology is not out of our affordable reach, but that it is here for us to use,” said Joseph McNeil, the chief executive of SAGE, a clean energy organization owned by the tribe that is spearheading the project.

The Standing Rock Reservation, home to the Lakota and Dakota peoples, is rural and spread out, straddling the border between North and South Dakota. The cost of gas aggravates the reservation’s high poverty rates. With the closest commercial centers at least an hour away, access to reliable transportation is a measure of well being.

“Our economic situation shouldn’t dictate our access to sustainability,” Mr. McNeil said. He wants every SAGE project to create jobs or revenue for the tribe. Institutions that are hosting the E.V. chargers, like the college, will eventually take ownership of them and collect any revenue.

SAGE’s project director, Fawn Wasin Zi, said E.V.s were part of a longstanding push for clean energy on the reservation. In 2016, the tribe was in the midst of planning a wind farm when protests to block the Dakota Access Pipeline engulfed the reservation. Their fight against a plan to transport oil over their sacred lands was recognized with an award from the Wallace Global Fund, which came with a $250,000 prize and a $1 million investment earmarked for the ongoing wind farm project.

The tribe may be widely known for the anti-pipeline movement, Ms. Wasin Zi said, “but there’s so much more going on.” She was managing the wind project at the time and used the prize to start SAGE. “The traditional way is to live with Unci Maka, Grandmother Earth, not against her,” she said.

The pipeline also helped inspire the regional E.V. project.

“As I was protesting, I thought, ‘What if we connected all the tribes in an electric vehicle charging network?’” said Robert Blake, a solar energy developer in Minneapolis. “It would be another form of resistance against fossil fuel infrastructure.” A few years later, Mr. Blake formed Native Sun, a nonprofit group dedicated to renewable energy outreach in tribal nations.

In 2021, Native Sun and SAGE teamed up and jointly won a $6 million Department of Energy grant to create Electric Nation. More funders followed, and the project took off.

Today, eight chargers have been installed at key locations around Standing Rock including local schools, a tribal administration building, Sitting Bull College and two casinos. Four more, coming later this month, will mark the completion of the project.

There’s even more in Red Lake Nation, where Mr. Blake is from. He has heard from other tribes in different parts of the country who now want to recreate Electric Nation on their lands. The network is a crucial first step in helping residents see gas-free cars as a viable, climate-friendly option.

SAGE has also used grant funding to give six electric vehicles to various institutions across the reservation.

These vehicles are improving daily life in small but meaningful ways. Sitting Bull College’s facilities director, Scott Gates, now uses a Ford Lightning E.V. to haul equipment and rescue cars stuck in the snow. Leo Red Horse, a clerk at the tribe’s administrative offices, takes an electric shuttle, provided by Standing Rock Public Transit, to work most mornings. Four teachers share a ride to the local elementary school in a Chevy Blazer, which is often plugged in to the school’s solar-powered chargers.

In November, Standing Rock Public Transit added a new electric van to its fleet, with a longer driving range than the first. It will take riders as far as Bismarck, N.D., the nearest commercial hub, an hour away. The school district also has plans to purchase several more electric vehicles for teacher car pools, along with some electric school buses.

SAGE hopes to eventually place a community-shared E.V. and charger in each of the reservation’s eight districts. In a place with a 40 percent poverty rate, free access to an E.V. matters. Even though electric cars typically cost less than gas ones over the lifetime of the vehicle, the initial purchase does not.

There’s also broad concern about how the cars will fare in the region’s harsh winters. Cold weather, combined with energy needed to heat the car, can affect battery efficiency and cause an E.V.’s range to drop by up to 30 percent.

Climate-friendly choices often have to take a back seat in light of the struggles many people on the reservation face daily, like affording food for the next day, said Steve Sitting Bear, the tribe’s recently elected chairman.

But, “inherently, as tribal members, we don’t like to see the destruction of the environment, of our land, the poisoning of our water,” he said. “I want us to be a self-sufficient, sovereign nation leading the way, whether that’s with wind or solar.”

Today, SAGE’s small team is juggling several projects alongside building out the electric vehicle network, including the ongoing wind farm development and a community solar project.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18cli-50x50-nd-promo-jghb/18cli-50x50-nd-promo-jghb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 02:58:10.609303

The federal subsidies did not guarantee that nuclear energy could be produced at competitive rates compared to other generation sources.
These states also adopted additional state-level derisking policies to provide further impetus for developers to undertake nuclear projects.
Welton and Harrison suggest that additional public oversight of derisking initiatives is necessary to manage the hidden risks associated with energy projects that rely on derisking policies.
Climate derisking is a complex and uncertain method for pursuing clean energy, Welton and Harrison acknowledge.","Scholars argue that failed nuclear projects reveal flaws in strategies to promote renewable energy today.

With climate change, many scientists fear that if countries do not mitigate global warming through decarbonization, sea levels will continue to rise, natural disasters will become more common, and large swaths of the planet may become uninhabitable.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which the U.S. Congress adopted in 2022, aims to encourage private investment in renewable energy. It seeks to promote this investment through “derisking”—the use of government incentives to increase the attractiveness of private investments into clean energy by minimizing the risk of profit loss. Sometimes referred to as a “carrots without sticks” approach to decarbonization, the IRA leverages tax credits for clean energy industries and includes conditions that enhance the value of these tax credits to spur investment.

In a recent article, Shelley Welton of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and Conor Harrison of the University of South Carolina critique the IRA’s derisking approach by examining a prior use of this strategy—a failed attempt to revive the U.S. nuclear energy industry in the early 2000s. Drawing on this failure, they argue that derisking clean energy projects may result in utility ratepayers bearing the financial burden of projects with little to no decarbonization benefits.

Derisking strategies have been present in the United States for a long time, note Welton and Harrison. They trace these strategies back to land grants and financial incentives for railroads in the 1880s. Over the past 50 years, the U.S. government has leveraged risk mitigation tools to promote renewable energy following the advent of electricity markets—often with great success, according to Welton and Harrison.

Yet they point to one former climate derisking effort—the attempted restoration of U.S. nuclear power in the early 21st century—that they observe offers several important cautionary lessons for regulators.

Starting in 2000, concerns about rising energy prices, air pollution, and the recent accident-free record of nuclear generation prompted utilities to consider new investments. A subsequent broad lobbying effort culminated in the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This law offered production tax credits, loan guarantees, and risk insurance to utilities willing to invest in new nuclear reactors. Welton and Harrison explain that the goal of these incentives was to lower the barrier to entry for utilities and help shield investors and lenders from risks associated with the new projects.

But according to Welton and Harrison, these incentives failed to entice a large majority of U.S. energy firms. The federal subsidies did not guarantee that nuclear energy could be produced at competitive rates compared to other generation sources. Welton and Harrison explain that only a handful of southern states—those that relied on traditional public utility regulation that ensured utilities could pass construction costs onto customers—chose to pursue these nuclear incentives. These states also adopted additional state-level derisking policies to provide further impetus for developers to undertake nuclear projects.

The results were grim, say Welton and Harrison. They observe that Georgia’s Plant Vogtle was the sole example of a completed nuclear reactor built using incentives provided by the Energy Policy Act. This project, however, was completed over a decade behind schedule and cost more than $35 billion, double its initial budget.

South Carolina fared no better, according to Welton and Harrison. They explain that the state never completed its nuclear venture, leaving two unfinished reactors and nearly $9 billion in costs. Florida and North Carolina, two other states that pursued nuclear investments, also abandoned their projects. Utilities forced ratepayers to shoulder much of the financial burden of these failed nuclear projects with very little to show for them, Welton and Harrison note.

Drawing on these case studies, Welton and Harrison identify a few hidden risks in derisking initiatives that threaten to derail future climate investment. For example, they cite permitting hurdles and legal challenges that have frequently delayed energy projects. Welton and Harrison explain that new energy ventures often unfold at a glacial pace, spanning decades. At the same time, energy markets undergo dramatic shifts in the background, changing the financial calculus that prompted the initial project investments. Political and institutional commitments also keep these failed projects alive long after investors should have withdrawn their support.

Welton and Harrison argue that poorly designed derisking strategies—ones that do not adequately address these hidden risks—result in clean energy projects that can harm communities and fail to decarbonize the grid. Local communities will frequently bear the financial burden of these projects, despite the promised national benefits these projects often fail to deliver. Welton and Harrison suggest that additional public oversight of derisking initiatives is necessary to manage the hidden risks associated with energy projects that rely on derisking policies.

Climate derisking is a complex and uncertain method for pursuing clean energy, Welton and Harrison acknowledge. But they note that derisking is the politically viable path chosen by Congress, through the IRA, to address a warming climate. It is now up to federal administrators to protect against misguided projects, and their agencies must expand their capacities to manage the clean energy transition, Welton and Harrison argue.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bradley11.19.2025-526258524.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 01:59:34.988862

There’s also the infrastructure problem: where exactly are you supposed to use this 450 kW charging capability?","The Lotus Emeya has set a new benchmark for production electric vehicle charging performance, reaching a peak rate of 443 kW during independent testing conducted by Lotus Al Ghanim in Kuwait. Using Lotus’s proprietary 450 kW DC ultra-fast charger, the hyper-GT completed a 10-80% charge in just 13 minutes and 35 seconds, even under extreme heat conditions. The achievement cements the Emeya’s position as one of the fastest-charging electric vehicles available to consumers in 2025.

The record represents a significant improvement over the Emeya’s previous charging benchmark. Earlier this year, the same vehicle achieved 402 kW during testing, charging from 10-80% in 14 minutes. That performance already placed the Lotus ahead of high-performance rivals like the Porsche Taycan and Hyundai Ioniq 6, which typically charge in the 300 kW range.

Advanced Battery and Cooling Technology Enable Record Speed

The Emeya’s charging performance is enabled by a cell-to-pack battery structure, which increases usable cell density by around 20% compared with traditional module-based designs. Lotus pairs this with a redesigned cooling system to maintain thermal stability during sustained high-power charging events.

Its 800-volt architecture, shared with the Lotus Eletre, boosts charging speed and improves overall efficiency. The system reduces heat, supports repeated fast-charging sessions, and helps keep energy consumption as low as 18.7 kWh/100 km (62 miles). Under ideal conditions, the Emeya can add up to 310 km (193 miles) of range in just 10 minutes.

The 2026 Emeya variant boasts a WLTP-rated range of up to 379 miles (610 km), making it one of the most efficient long-range EVs in its class. This reinforces Lotus’s commitment to both performance and practical real-world range. The engineering precision philosophy extends across Lotus’s history, evident in its EVs and collectible lightweight sports cars.

Charging Ecosystem and European Rollout

Lotus is expanding its 450 kW DC charging network across Europe, starting in Germany, with additional markets to follow. The ecosystem integrates with the Lotus Cars app and the brand’s HyperOS infotainment platform, offering intelligent EV routing, energy-aware trip planning and real-time charging optimization.

This growth supports the brand’s broader multi-powertrain strategy, which now includes future models like the upcoming plug-in hybrid Emira, showing how Lotus is balancing its electrified future with more traditional performance offerings.

Why This Record Matters

Reaching 443 kW puts the Emeya right at the forefront of real-world charging performance, showing Lotus’s ambition to lead the performance-EV market. As charging networks get better around the world, this kind of high-power charging will be key to cutting down on long-distance travel times and making EVs with big batteries more feasible.

For Lotus, this achievement makes the Emeya a standout in technology and highlights the company’s goal to merge its performance heritage with the latest in electrification, even as the business itself is going through changes.

EVXL’s Take

Lotus just achieved something genuinely impressive: the fastest production EV charging speed we’ve seen outside China’s domestic market. The 443 kW peak and sub-14-minute charging time beat Porsche, beat Tesla, and beat every traditional Western automaker. That’s the good news.

Here’s the uncomfortable reality: technical excellence doesn’t pay the bills. Lotus announced 550 job cuts at its historic Hethel headquarters in August 2025—40% of its UK workforce—after sales dropped 42% in Q1 2025. The company posted a $183 million net loss and is drowning in $3.3 billion of debt despite Geely’s massive investment. The Emeya and Eletre EVs, built in China, delivered just 719 units combined in Q1. Meanwhile, the company is pivoting to plug-in hybrids because pure EV demand hasn’t materialized as expected.

The charging record also highlights an uncomfortable truth we’ve been tracking at EVXL: Chinese automakers are winning the ultra-fast charging race. While Lotus hits 443 kW, Chinese rival Zeekr is achieving 630 kW peaks with its 7X SUV, charging from 10-80% in under 10 minutes. BYD announced 1,000 kW charging capability that adds 249 miles in just five minutes. Lotus is celebrating a record that’s already been surpassed in the Chinese market where the Emeya is actually manufactured.

There’s also the infrastructure problem: where exactly are you supposed to use this 450 kW charging capability? In the U.S., Tesla’s V4 Superchargers max out at 500 kW, and those are still rare. Most public fast chargers deliver 150-250 kW. Electrify America stations hit 350 kW if you’re lucky and they’re working. Lotus is building its own 450 kW network in Europe, but that’s a chicken-and-egg problem: you need critical mass of vehicles to justify the infrastructure investment, and Lotus sold just 41 vehicles in Australia through July 2025.

The Emeya represents everything Lotus does well: brilliant engineering, cutting-edge technology, genuine performance credibility. It also represents everything Lotus struggles with: premium pricing in a value-conscious EV market, Chinese manufacturing facing Western tariff barriers, and a brand identity crisis between heritage sports cars and luxury EVs.

So yes, 443 kW is legitimately impressive. The engineering team at Lotus deserves recognition for pushing the boundaries of what’s commercially available. But world-class charging speed won’t save a company that can’t move metal off dealer lots. In the EV industry’s brutal shakeout, technical prowess is table stakes—survival requires solving the much harder problems of cost structure, market positioning, and achieving scale.

Most non-Tesla charging stations had become inoperable, suggesting a disturbing motive. Public outrage expressed how these actions could impede progress toward cleaner transportation.

The Redditor shared their situation in the r/Reno subreddit. They described widespread vandalism that had crippled the city's EV charging infrastructure. The post is from three years ago, yet it highlights an ongoing issue.

""Some nut job has cut all the EV charging cables in Reno except for Tesla,"" the user wrote. ""I have nowhere to charge my car for work now.""

The user said Electrify America stations in Sparks, Nevada, and EVgo cables were targets as well.

""The cables were cut at the base of the charging station. They didn't leave anything behind,"" they explained.

Some believed it was a deliberate act of destruction rather than theft. The pattern of vandalism had left many EV drivers in Reno without charging access.

Instances of EV and charging station vandalism such as this are frustrating for drivers.

By September 2024, vandals had cut 215 of the 1,000 Electrify America charging stations in North America, according to Insurance Journal. Similar incidents pose a significant barrier to the adoption of EVs.

Vandalized charging stations impact drivers' daily commute and ability to travel. This premeditated destruction can also make potential EV buyers hesitant. They may start thinking EVs have an unreliable infrastructure.

Vandalism can also slow the transition away from dirty energy sources such as gas and oil. Fewer EVs on the road means more tailpipe pollution, leading to poor air quality and public health in our communities.

Concerns about pollution from battery manufacturing are sometimes raised. However, cars with the ""dirtiest"" batteries are still cleaner than cars with no battery. Each year, millions of tons of minerals get used for the clean energy transition. This is a fraction of the billions of tons of dirty energy, burned and not reusable, extracted yearly.

More security and respect for charging stations could be a vital part of supporting a cleaner, safer future.

While progress may be on the way, EV drivers can reliably charge at home by installing solar panels. One of the many benefits of EVs is they are more cost-effective than gas-powered vehicles, with home solar energy being cheaper to use for charging than relying on the grid or public stations. Qmerit offers quick, free installation quotes for Level 2 chargers. EnergySage and its TCD-vetted local installers can save you up to $10,000 on installations.

Power consumption has grown 20 gigawatts from the previous winter, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. said Tuesday in its winter assessment. A gigawatt is the typical size of a nuclear power reactor. Supply hasn’t kept up.

As as result, a repeat of severe winter storms in North America that unleash a polar vortex, of which there have been several in recent years, could trigger energy shortfalls across the US from the Northwest to Texas to the Carolinas. All regions have adequate resources in normal conditions.

“Data centers are a main contributor to load growth in those areas where demand has risen substantially since last winter.” Mark Olson, manager of the reliability assessment, said in an emailed statement.

America’s power grid has been facing rising blackout risks for years as aging infrastructure is increasingly stressed by severe storms and wildfires. Now the data center boom, driven by the spread of artificial intelligence, is adding to the strain by supercharging US electricity growth after being stagnant for two decades.

Winter is especially risky because solar generation is available for fewer hours and battery operations may be affected. Gas supplies, meantime, could drop off because of freeze-offs or pipeline constraints.

The areas designated by NERC as having elevated risks of shortfall shifted from the previous winter to include the US southeast and parts of the West, including Washington and Oregon.

The Texas grid continues to be highlighted after cascading failures in February 2021 left millions of people without power for days and resulted in more than 200 deaths. New England also continues to face elevated risks on potential natural gas pipeline constraints.

When federal safeguards weaken, local rules decide how clean—or how dirty—the air gets. In mid-2025, the White House granted two-year delays for certain hazardous-air-pollutant standards covering dozens of large chemical-manufacturing facilities, including one within the Phillips 66 complex in Borger, Texas. Meanwhile, its sister refinery in New Jersey must carry on under the full force of both federal and state oversight. For families living near these plants, geography now dictates protection. Nearly 845,000 residents live within ten miles of New Jersey’s Bayway refinery—barely 2,200 around Borger’s—two very different stories emanating from similar operations and riding similar winds.

New Jersey — where the rules still mean something

The Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery in Linden processes about a quarter-million barrels of crude oil a day, bordered by neighborhoods, schools, and tidal marshes. Winds here usually blow from west to east, carrying faint refinery smells across Elizabeth and Bayonne toward the harbor and Staten Island. Residents notice it. But New Jersey’s environmental agency doesn’t wait for complaints; it has built some of the nation’s most stringent air pollutant regulations.

EPA modeling suggests that refineries the size and type of Bayway should carry some of the nation’s highest health risks from toxic air pollutants—driven mostly by formaldehyde and benzene. Yet that’s not what the real-world health impact data show. In the ten-mile corridor east and northeast of Bayway, where the emissions typically drift, COPD prevalence averages just under 5½ percent and cancer diagnoses just above 5½ percent—both below national levels. The likely reason: New Jersey’s unusually strict permitting rules and cumulative-risk reviews, which have forced steady reductions in emissions over time. The air isn’t pristine, but it’s measured, managed, and closely watched.

Each time Bayway seeks a permit or expansion, the state runs formal risk reviews that estimate potential cancer or health effects and require air-quality modeling to check whether emissions stay below safety targets. If the numbers don’t clear the bar, tighter limits or new controls follow. These reviews sit on top of federal rules that already require continuous benzene monitoring at refinery fencelines - think of a “fenceline” as where the plant’s air meets the public’s air, and the monitors are like smoke detectors that make sure pollution isn’t sneaking out. Bayway’s recent readings have stayed below the maximum levels, and state regulations go even further—folding the results into a broader look at cumulative risks (in NJ, other factors include automobile exhaust and pollutants from Newark International Airport) for nearby communities instead of treating each pollutant or permit in isolation.

Texas — where the guardrails are farther apart

A thousand miles from Linden, the Phillips 66 complex in Borger tells a similar story under looser rules. Built during the same early-20th-century oil boom as Bayway, it still anchors the skyline of this Panhandle town. The site actually includes two major operations: a refinery that handles about 150,000 barrels of crude a day and a chemical-manufacturing plant. The refinery remains covered by the federal refinery-sector standards, but the chemical unit was among roughly fifty facilities granted a two-year delay from updated federal hazardous-air-pollutant controls. For the next two years, that portion of the complex will rely primarily on Texas’s lighter-touch regulatory system.

Most of the year, Borger’s winds blow from the south, carrying emissions north toward Stinnett and Lake Meredith; in winter, they swing the other way. For many residents, the wind is simply part of life. Yet for those living downwind, the air doesn’t distinguish between refinery stacks and chemical stacks—it carries whatever leaves the fence line. In the ten-mile north-northeast sector downwind of Borger, the plant’s air toxins include a similar chemical profile: formaldehyde, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene. About 2,200 residents live inside that zone, and COPD rates sit at nearly 9½ percent, with cancer prevalence near 9 percent, both above Texas and national averages, and nearly double the rates seen in New Jersey.

Texas takes a lighter approach. The state environmental agency relies on Effects Screening Levels, guideline numbers for hundreds of chemicals that help decide whether a refinery’s projected emissions look acceptable. They’re not enforceable limits—just screens. If modeled levels exceed them, regulators may ask for adjustments, but plants usually keep operating while paperwork and negotiations continue. The refinery must still follow the same federal benzene fenceline rule as Bayway, yet other hazardous-air-pollutant controls that would tighten under HON are now paused. For the next two years, Borger’s air will depend largely on state discretion, not federal guidelines—a difference that runs like the wind.

Two refineries, same logo, different playbooks

On paper, the Bayway and Borger refineries operate under the same Clean Air Act rules and corporate safety commitments. In reality, though, their oversight couldn’t be more different. New Jersey measures and manages risk before a problem becomes a crisis; Texas trusts its screening levels and self-reporting to catch issues after the fact. With the federal HON standards on hold for at least two years, those differences now decide how much protection nearby families can count on. Same company, same history, same rulebook—but two entirely different games being played—one with referees on the field, one running only on the public’s trust.

Who’s in charge?

The EPA sets the national limits for hazardous organic emissions under the Clean Air Act. New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection goes further, layering its own risk thresholds and community reviews on top of those federal rules. Texas, by contrast, relies mainly on guideline numbers and industry self-reporting, stepping in only when those screens are exceeded. The result is a patchwork of protection that mirrors America’s political geography more than its science.

When federal protections pause, the air doesn’t. Pipes keep venting, wind keeps blowing, and communities keep breathing what comes their way. The real test will arrive not when rules restart, but when we measure what changed in their absence. New Jersey’s families will have spent those years under dual oversight. Borger’s will have spent them trusting that guidance levels and good intentions were enough. The question is not whether companies can meet the same standard, but whether the country still expects them to. Pollution and fairness drift on the same wind—and when safeguards go quiet, the air doesn’t wait. Neither should we.

For each refinery, I defined a 10-mile downwind sector based on prevailing winds (Bayway: ENE; Borger: NNE–ENE). I mapped a sector cone (±45–75° as needed to reflect seasonal shifts) and identified census tracts/ZCTAs whose centroids fall inside the cone.

See these rough images I used for all the screening tools:

Note that the prevailing wind in Linden is much more widespread seasonally than it is in Borger. Let me know if you’d like me to send specs to an artist, or if you’d like, you can certainly include these layers I built on top of Google maps.

Quick note on federal government environmental data and monitoring tools

It’s shocking to see how federal data collection, online tools, and educational information have disappeared from federal websites like the EPA, FDA, and others. The scrubbing and removal of the tools and information will undoubtedly have significant, irreversible impacts…probably a really good topic for another piece. It reminds me of the story surrounding the public reporting of COVID infections and the unwillingness of a Florida official to manipulate the data in 2020.

For example:

AirToxScreen is still online at EPA and described as an annual screening tool. EPA pages indicate a 2020 assessment released May 2024 though there’s no indication that it will be updated going forward.

In early 2025 the administration removed EJScreen (the environmental justice mapping tool) and other equity/data tools from EPA’s website; lawsuits and watchdog reports have documented those removals. Data is certainly missing everywhere, but even basic usability has degraded on all sites.

China is eyeing the global electric truck market Already the world’s largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.

In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.

Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbon-dioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.

Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.

China’s trucking fleet, the world’s second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and “in other countries, it might never take off,” he said.

Costs fall in China’s electric truck pivot

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are twice to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle’s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

“When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,” Doleman said.

Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.

Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

CATL, the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering 150,000 kilometers (about 93,000 miles) out of China’s 184,000 kms (about 114,000 miles) of expressways.

Global energy markets will feel the impact

The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.

Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“The rise of China’s electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,” said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.

LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of ICCT Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground.

Shell’s 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world’s largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.

China’s electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group.

But Doleman views LNG as a “transitional step” unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.

China’s is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer’s fleet. This will make it “almost impossible” for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.

A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance.

China is eyeing the global electric truck market

Already the world’s largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.

Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited.

China’s hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted.

In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVS to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge.

China’s Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It is has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others.

In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels.

Prices of zero-emission trucks in Europe must roughly halve to become affordable alternatives to diesel, according to another study in 2024 by McKinsey.

Volvo told The Associated Press that it didn’t comment on competitors but welcomed “competition on fair terms,” while Scania did not respond.

“Things are shaking up,” Daiss said. ___

November 5: CAC President Elizabeth Wydra joined Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to discuss Learning Resources v. Trump.","This month, the Supreme Court is considering two major challenges to Trump overreach—one on its merits docket and one on its shadow docket—and CAC has been involved in both.

At the beginning of November, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the challenge to President Trump’s unlawful tariffs. Our amicus brief ex

plained that President Trump doesn’t have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to single-handedly set global tariffs. As CAC Legal Fellow Simon Chin explained after oral argument, “The Government argues that when Congress passed IEEPA, in 1977, it carried forward authority over tariffs from an older law called the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). But as Neal Katyal, counsel for the private challengers, emphasized at oral argument when citing our brief, a 1933 amendment to TWEA severed that law from its original war powers foundations.”

The stakes of this case are high, as CAC President Elizabeth Wydra emphasized in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. As Elizabeth explained, the Court has “so far, in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs. This will be a test of whether they will actually be the check that the Constitution envisions on the Executive.”

Among Trump’s many other disturbing power grabs has been his deployment of the National Guard in American cities. CAC is fighting back in courts from coast to coast, filing amicus briefs against Trump’s unlawful use of the National Guard in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

Most recently, CAC filed a brief in the Supreme Court explaining why it should deny the government’s request to stay a district court injunction blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. Our brief explains that Martin v. Mott, a case arising out of the War of 1812, doesn’t insulate the President’s deployment decision from judicial review.

Because the Trump administration relies on Mott in claiming that courts can’t review its decision to deploy the Guard, CAC’s historical research has been a helpful resource in setting the record straight. Our brief was cited as providing a valuable perspective in Slate magazine and the One First newsletter. And when Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, seemingly claimed that Trump had unreviewable “plenary power,” CAC’s Deputy Chief Counsel Brian Frazelle was quick to explain that he was “flat wrong.”

With both the Los Angeles National guard case and the consolidated tariffs cases before the Supreme Court, CAC’s historical research provides key context and insight for the Justices. As Elizabeth suggested, now is the Supreme Court’s chance to show it can serve as a check on the Trump administration’s lawless actions.

Appalachian Voices v. Environmental Protection Agency — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally terminate an entire mandatory grant program created by Congress. Our brief argues that the Constitution’s separation of powers prohibits the President from unilaterally withholding federal funds based on disagreement with congressional policy, and because the Trump administration unilaterally terminated a mandatory grant program, the executive branch violated the Constitution’s separation of powers. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, brief filed November 3.

League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President — WIN — The D.C. District Court held that President Trump’s executive order requiring proof of citizenship on the Federal Form for registering voters violated the separation of powers. Echoing our brief, the court observed that the Elections Clause “provides that Congress—not the President—is the check on States’ authority to regulate federal elections.” C. District Court, decision rendered October 31.

Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections — The Supreme Court is considering whether President Trump has the legal authority to single-handedly impose tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs—namely, that the relevant federal law incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA)—explaining why this narrative is unsound at every step. Supreme Court, brief filed October 24.

Illinois v. Trump— WIN — In October 2025, the Seventh Circuit denied the administration’s motion for a stay, leaving in place a district court order that prevents troops from deploying in Chicago. In doing so, the Seventh Circuit adopted the reasoning of CAC’s amicus brief to conclude that Martin v. Mott does not foreclose judicial review. The Trump administration subsequently asked the Supreme Court to stay the district court’s order, and CAC filed an amicus brief opposing the administration’s application, reiterating our arguments about why courts can review the President’s decisions to mobilize the National Guard. That application is currently pending. Seventh Circuit, brief filed October 12, decision rendered October 16, brief filed in Supreme Court October 20.

Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto v. HHS — WIN — In a case challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to cut off funding for legal services for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. The Court addressed—and rejected—the government’s jurisdictional argument. Echoing our brief, the Court understood the Plaintiffs to challenge the government’s failure to comply with the TVPRA’s mandate, rather than raise a breach-of-contract claim. Ninth Circuit, decision rendered October 10.

Grundmann v. Trump — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether Donald Trump’s attempted firing of the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority was illegal. Our brief explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt, and also demonstrates that the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. C. Circuit, brief filed October 10.
