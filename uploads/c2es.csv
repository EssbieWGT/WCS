For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

The group also criticized studies questioning ethanol’s climate impact as relying on “cherry-picked data and disproven premises.”

But independent research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

When fire broke out at the world’s largest battery energy storage facility in January 2025, its thick smoke blanketed surrounding wetlands, farms and nearby communities on the central California coast.

Highways closed, residents evacuated and firefighters could do little but watch as debris and ash rained down. People living in the area reported headaches and respiratory problems, and some pets and livestock fell ill.

Two days later, officials announced that the air quality met federal safety standards. But the initial all-clear decision missed something important – heavy metal fallout on the ground.

When battery energy storage facilities burn, the makeup of the chemical fallout can be a mystery for surrounding communities. Yet, these batteries often contain metals that are toxic to humans and wildlife.

The smoke plume from the fire in Vistra’s battery energy storage facility at Moss Landing released not just hazardous gases such as hydrogen fluoride but also soot and charred fragments of burned batteries that landed for miles around.

I am a marine geologist who has been tracking soil changes in marshes adjacent to the Vistra facility for over a decade as part of a wetland-restoration project. In a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports, my colleagues and I were able to show through detailed before-and-after samples from the marshes what was in the battery fire’s debris and what happened to the heavy metals.

The batteries’ metal fragments, often too tiny to see with the naked eye, didn’t disappear. They continue to be remobilized in the environment today.

What’s inside the batteries

Moss Landing, at the edge of Monterey Bay, has long been shaped by industry – a mix of power generation and intensive agriculture on the edge of a delicate coastal ecosystem.

The Vistra battery storage facility rose on the site of an old Duke Energy and PG&E gas power plant, which was once filled with turbines and oil tanks. When Vistra announced it was converting the site into the world’s largest lithium-ion battery facility, the plan was hailed as a clean energy milestone. Phase 1 alone housed batteries with 300 megawatts of capacity, enough to power about 225,000 homes for four hours.

The energy in rechargeable batteries comes from the flow of electrons released by lithium atoms in the anode moving toward the cathode.

In the type of batteries at the Moss Landing facility, the cathode was rich in three metals: nickel, manganese and cobalt. These batteries are prized for their high energy density and relatively low cost, but they are also prone to thermal runaway.

Lab experiments have shown that burning batteries can eject metal particles like confetti.

Metals found in wetlands matched batteries

When my team and I returned to the marsh three days after the fire, ash and burned debris covered the ground. Weeks afterward, charred fragments still clung to the vegetation.

Our measurements with portable X-ray fluorescence showed sharp increases in nickel, manganese and cobalt compared with data from before the fire. As soon as we saw the numbers, we alerted officials in four counties about the risk.

We estimate that about 25 metric tons (55,000 pounds) of heavy metals were deposited across roughly half a square mile (1.2 square kilometers) of wetland around Elkorn Slough, and that was only part of the area that saw fallout.

To put this in perspective, the part of the Vistra battery facility that burned was hosting 300 megawatts of batteries, which equates to roughly 1,900 metric tons of cathode material. Estimates of the amount of batteries that burned range from 55% to 80%. Based on those estimates, roughly 1,000 to 1,400 metric tons of cathode material could have been carried into the smoke plume. What we found in the marsh represents about 2% of what may have been released.

We took samples at hundreds of locations and examined millimeter-thin soil slices with a scanning electron microscope. Those slices revealed metallic particles smaller than one-tenth the width of a human hair – small enough to travel long distances and lodge deep in the lungs.

The ratio of nickel to cobalt in these particles matched that of nickel, manganese and cobalt battery cathodes, clearly linking the contamination to the fire.

Over the following months, we found that surface concentrations of the metals dropped sharply after major rain and tidal events, but the metals did not disappear. They were remobilized. Some migrated to the main channel of the estuary and may have been flushed out into the ocean. Some of the metals that settled in the estuary could enter the food chain in this wildlife hot spot, often populated with sea otters, harbor seals, pelicans and herons.

Making battery storage safer as it expands

The fire at Moss Landing and its fallout hold lessons for other communities, first responders and the design of future lithium-ion battery systems, which are proliferating as utilities seek to balance renewable power and demand peaks.

When fires break out, emergency responders need to know what they’re dealing with. A California law passed after the fire helps address this by requiring strengthening containment and monitoring at large battery installations and meetings with local fire officials before new facilities open.

Newer lithium-ion batteries that use iron phosphate cathodes are also considered safer from fire risk. These are becoming more common for utility-scale energy storage than batteries with nickel, manganese and cobalt, though they store less energy.

How soil is tested is also important. At Moss Landing, some of the government’s sampling turned up low concentrations of the metals, likely because the samples came from broad, mixed layers that diluted the concentration of metals rather than the thin surface deposits where contaminants settled.

Continuing risks to marine life

Metals from the Moss Landing battery fire still linger in the region’s sediments and food webs.

These metals bioaccumulate, building up through the food chain: The metals in marsh soils can be taken up by worms and small invertebrates, which are eaten by fish, crabs or shorebirds, and eventually by top predators such as sea otters or harbor seals.

Our research group is now tracking the bioaccumulation in Elkhorn Slough’s shellfish, crabs and fish. Because uptake varies among species and seasons, the effect of the metals on ecosystems will take months or years to emerge.

The organizations will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan.

The goal for these projects is to develop and construct the first Gen III+ small modular reactor (Gen III+ SMR) plants in the United States.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

Specifically, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) will receive $400 million to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee. It will also work to accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl. Further, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

In addition, Holtec Government Services will receive $400 million. It plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan. Holtec is pursuing a one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

Affordability The Trump administration said the move would save Americans money, reducing the average cost of new vehicles by about 2% or $1,000.
But environmentalists say the opposite — that increased fuel standards reduce the amount of gasoline needed to go the average mile.
“I would say it’s very deceptive what the Trump administration is saying that this will save consumers a lot of money,” he said.
“In Philadelphia, we have a number of really important air pollution sources, including refineries and legacy industries around our region,” Clougherty said.","This story is part of the WHYY News Climate Desk, bringing you news and solutions for our changing region.

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

President Donald Trump announced this week plans to rollback Biden-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, citing affordability.

The Biden administration set fuel efficiency standards for automakers to manufacture vehicles that would run an average 50.4 miles per gallon for the 2031 model year as a way to reduce harmful air pollutants and climate warming greenhouse gas emissions. The newly proposed standards weaken those rules to 34.5 mpg, making it much easier to reach with gas-powered vehicles.

“This is the final nail in the coffin of the Trump administration’s plans to completely obliterate the federal climate program writ large,” said Jeff Alson, a retired engineer who worked for 40 years at the Environmental Protection Agency, where he helped to establish clean car standards under the Obama administration.

In announcing the new rule, Trump said the previous standards are “ridiculously burdensome,” and would have raised the cost of new vehicles by $1,000, or about 2% of the current average cost of a new vehicle, which is $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. The move follows reversals of other Biden-era policies that encouraged the manufacture of electric vehicles, and more cleaner cars and trucks.

“Today we’re taking one more step to kill the green new scam,” Trump said while announcing the rules at the White House on Wednesday. “The greatest scam in American history, the green new scam, it’s a quest to end the gasoline-powered car, this is what they wanted to do even though we have more gasoline than any other country by far and people want the gasoline car.”

What are CAFE standards?

Congress enacted the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards, or CAFE, in 1975, directing the Department of Transportation to establish the rules in response to high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil. Opponents say the rules are effectively an “EV mandate” because the country is no longer dependent on oil imports and the Biden administration instead raised the bar so high it would mean more electric vehicle production at the expense of gas-powered cars and trucks.

“Today’s a victory of common sense and affordability,” said Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley who joined Trump in the Oval Office, along with Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa and General Motors plant manager John Urbanic.

Earlier this year, Congress defanged the CAFE standards by eliminating the penalties as part of the budget bill.

Affordability

The Trump administration said the move would save Americans money, reducing the average cost of new vehicles by about 2% or $1,000. But environmentalists say the opposite — that increased fuel standards reduce the amount of gasoline needed to go the average mile.

“Consumers will be paying more at the pump,” said Jason Schwartz, legal director of the Institute for Policy Integrity, a think tank based at New York University School of Law.

Schwartz said the Department of Transportation created a “new category of supposed costs” to offset the increased usage of gasoline for less-efficient vehicles. For example, without the focus on creating more efficiency, the car makers could increase horsepower that could lead to savings.

“And so, what the Department of Transportation has done is assign some value to those supposed losses, and is using that to try to offset a mythical cost to try to erase from their tally sheet all the fuel savings that consumers are going to lose out on,” Schwartz said.

In addition to pumping more gas, an annual report from the government’s Energy Information Administration released in April shows that without the Biden-era climate rules that encouraged the manufacturing of cleaner cars, the price of gasoline will rise by 76 cents per gallon, Alson said.

“I would say it’s very deceptive what the Trump administration is saying that this will save consumers a lot of money,” he said. Alson added that while he agrees rolling back the fuel efficiency standards would save consumers about $1,000, the costs to consumers of higher gas prices would far outweigh the savings in the costs of new vehicles.

Health impacts on the Philly region

Public health advocates and environmentalists also say that while the fuel efficiency standards had the original goal of reducing reliance on foreign oil, the impact on air quality was significant.

“And that has been an incredible boon for public health and millions of lives saved and early deaths averted, because of those improvements in air quality,” said Jane Clougherty, professor of environmental and occupational health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health.

Clougherty said reducing fuel use would have lessened the tailpipe emissions, including volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, which are associated with poor health impacts including asthma and cardiovascular disease.

“In Philadelphia, we have a number of really important air pollution sources, including refineries and legacy industries around our region,” Clougherty said. “But no question, nitrogen dioxide is still one of the most important contributors to air pollution in our region.”

NYU’s Schwartz called it a “triple whammy,” starting with passing on more costs to consumers.

“It’s bad enough to increase greenhouse gas emissions. It’s especially bad since we’re already in a climate crisis,” Schwartz said. “It’s especially bad in combination with all of the other environmental rollbacks that we’re seeing. All those effects are just going to compound on each other.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/traffic-italian-market-philly-2025-04-29.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:00:21.158133

The Government will only meet its clean energy 2030 or 2050 decarbonised building targets if there is significant new intervention in the UK workforce, says the Commons Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in a report today. It says targeting consumer demand is necessary but not sufficient, and public funding to address the supply of skills directly is needed now.

The Committee calls for ‘local skilled labour’ conditions in Contracts for Difference, an expanded skills passport scheme, a leading role for local authorities, and greater clarity for industry on levies, EPC ratings and the Warm Homes Plan.

The UK needs an estimated 250,000 additional workers just to meet new housing targets, and many more for retrofit. After shocking failures in previous Government-backed retrofit and insulation schemes, the Committee calls for a new, nationally recognised, industry-backed construction and retrofit skills programme.

The energy transition offers substantial opportunity. The Climate Change Committee estimates net employment gains from the energy transition of between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs in the next four years . But the vast majority of these workers will have to train or reskill. The UK may need to import some specific skilled workers from overseas, at least in the short term, to meet its targets.

With up to 70% of those embarking on construction-related FE qualifications not completing or not entering the sector, the Committee says Government should expand and formalise 'try-before-you-buy' training opportunities. SMEs, the backbone of the construction and retrofit supply chain, will need support in taking on inexperienced trainees.

Chair comment

Bill Esterson MP, Chair of the Committee, said:

“It is essential that we build the workforce for the energy transition so that the Government can hit its clean energy targets and, importantly, ensure that the UK makes the most of the growth opportunity of the century.

“The Committee has found that market forces alone cannot overcome the skills gap. We need policy certainty for the long-term, locally directed investment in training, and policies that make clean energy careers attractive and accessible.

“For British workers this isn’t about hitting deadlines; it’s about securing good jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring Britain leads in the global race for clean energy.”

The Committee calls on Government to:

Put commitments to transition the existing local skilled labour supply into Contracts for Difference, leveraging UK manufacturing content requirements where possible.

By the end of 2026, set out the options for conditionality that can leverage more skilled immigration in the short-term and crucially boost support for home-grown talent longer-term.

Empower devolved government across the UK to lead on approaches tailored to local and regional strengths or weaknesses – and facilitate a greater role for local authorities to accelerate the roll-out of retrofit.

Give the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and Skills England the authority and resources to ensure the necessary consistency that will make skills portable across the country, in both the clean energy and the retrofit workforces.

Accelerate the adoption of clean energy and retrofit skills policies in the Spending Review, with a ten-year horizon for initiatives and funding which is revised and extended every five years. -Identify how new technologies can bring increases in productivity to help meet the scale of labour demand identified in this inquiry.

Launch new initiatives to promote clean energy and retrofit careers among under-represented groups and those outside the existing workforce.

Clarify its stance on how environmental levies will be paid for in future and what role they will play in electricity and gas bills, after welcome moves on the costs in electricity bills in the Budget.

Clarify its position on revisions to the EPC regime and the role of hydrogen in heating.

Promptly bring forward the Warm Homes Plan, setting out its estimate of workforce needs and how those needs will be met.

Louisiana Economic Development officials often sign nondisclosure agreements with local government leaders and corporate executives to keep negotiations secret.
“I’m tired of hearing ‘jobs, jobs, jobs,’” Joseph told LED officials at Wednesday’s hearing.
“Economic development has not happened for us,” LeBoeuf said.
“This is destruction masquerading as economic development,” Rolfes said.","Louisiana leaders have recently touted a string of major industrial projects with the promise of creating thousands of jobs, but critics say these business negotiations lack transparency and pose great risk to the health and prosperity of the communities where this investment is taking shape.

They also believe state officials have shut them out of trade deals with businesses that stand to benefit far more than them.

The critics included residents and community activists from across Louisiana who spoke out Wednesday at a state agency hearing, where they asked officials to stop secretly brokering trade deals that give taxpayer money to large industrial companies.

Numbering around a dozen, the group aired their concerns at a Louisiana Economic Development rules hearing, which are normally sparsely-attended and mundane bureaucratic processes with just two staff members there to record public comments.

Louisiana Economic Development had published a notice on Oct. 20 stating that it planned to “hold a public hearing for the purpose of receiving comments on any rule of the agency.” The notice contained no further details about the reason for the hearing and didn’t specify which rules the agency is reviewing. Staff members did not discuss any particular rules at the hearing.

The residents and activists — which included members of community and environmental groups such as the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Rural Roots Louisiana, the Descendants Project, Inclusive Louisiana and Fishermen Involved in Sustaining Our Heritage — used the hearing as an opportunity to air a variety of complaints about the impacts industrial expansion has had on their neighborhoods. They all signed a letter that summarized their complaints and then took turns speaking at the hearing.

In their letter submitted to Louisiana Economic Development, the group criticized the hearing notice as “vague” and wrote that it provided “no meaningful notice of what the agency is considering.”

They wrote and testified that the notice appeared to be part of a pattern of secrecy at the agency to fast-track industrial expansion in the state. They pointed to Gov. Jeff Landry’s Sept. 16 executive order, which he dubbed the “Louisiana Lightning Speed Initiative.” It directs Louisiana to push state agencies to fast-track permitting and regulatory processes to attract new businesses and spur industrial expansion, mentioning recent deals with Meta, Hyundai, Woodside Energy and CF Industries as examples.

In December 2024, the state announced that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was coming to Louisiana to build the world’s largest data center in Richland Parish. Construction of the facility began almost immediately.

Richland Parish residents Joe and Robin Williams also signed the letter submitted to LED. They live across the street from the Meta site and have reported rust-colored tap water and power outages at their home since construction activity began.

While the rapidly approved Meta project came as a surprise to Williams and the public, a small circle of Louisiana politicians had known about it and kept it under wraps for nearly a year. Several top leaders — including the governor, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois and Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson — quietly collaborated with corporate executives and local officials on the project, holding closed-door talks and rewriting state laws for reasons they withheld from the public and most of the Louisiana Legislature.

During the 2024 legislative session, Landry and DeVillier carried out plans to “hijack” another lawmaker’s bill, rewriting it in a way that would give a massive tax break to Meta without other legislators realizing it, as detailed in a Times-Picayune report. Bourgeois told the newspaper everyone involved in the negotiations signed “blank NDAs” (nondisclosure agreements) before the talks began.

Louisiana Economic Development officials often sign nondisclosure agreements with local government leaders and corporate executives to keep negotiations secret. In a phone interview Thursday, Bourgeois said it’s a common practice at the agency whenever a company requests it.

“It’s really just an industry standard,” Bourgeois said. “I understand there’s some people who don’t agree with it or like it, but go to any state and this is how it’s done.”

Companies often ask for the agreements so competitors don’t undercut or foil their plans, she said. For example, if a company knows about its rival’s plans to build at a certain location, they could rush to purchase the land out from under them, Bourgeois explained.

The Rev. Harry Joseph Sr., an Ascension Parish resident and church pastor, took part in Wednesday’s LED hearing. Speaking with the Illuminator before the meeting, he questioned the agency’s use of nondisclosure agreements and said his local elected officials routinely cite them as a reason they can’t answer questions about projects in his area.

“We elected them. We should be able to talk to them about anything,” Joseph said. “The secrecy has gotten out of hand. Enough is enough.”

Another example of secret negotiations, Joseph said, is the industrial RiverPlex MegaPark being built in the Modeste community of Ascension Parish. The area targeted for development had previously been zoned as a “conservation district” because it is “environmentally fragile” and lacked roads that can handle large traffic increases, according to the parish zoning code. Despite this, the state offered the MegaPark as a site for Hyundai’s new steel mill and two ammonia facilities.

Louisiana Economic Development signed nondisclosure agreements with Hyundai executives and Ascension Parish officials, preventing them from speaking about the projects, according to William Most, an attorney representing Rural Roots and the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

In an email, LED spokesperson Emma Wagner pushed back against the other criticisms lodged at Wednesday’s hearing, calling them part of an “ambush not based in the actual work of economic development” and job creation in Louisiana.

“This state has long suffered from a failure to diversify our economy,” Wagner wrote. “What we have done over the past 23 months is unprecedented and transformational economic growth that has finally turned the tide of losing our people.”

State and local leaders have touted industrial expansion as a way to bring new jobs to economically depressed areas. In exchange for the jobs, the state and the parishes typically offer the companies lucrative tax breaks and grants.

Joy Banner, co-founder of the Descendants Project, called on the state to require objective data on job creation and wage claims before incentivizing companies with Louisiana tax dollars.

Hyundai has said its steel mill will bring an estimated 1,300 jobs to Louisiana. In exchange, the state promised the company a $100 million grant and other incentives estimated to cost taxpayers $600 million, according to a Times-Picayune report.

CF Industries estimates it will bring 103 new jobs to its proposed ammonia facility in Ascension Parish. In exchange, the state offered the company a $6 million grant for the proposed ammonia plant in Ascension Parish. The company is also expected to be exempt from paying most parish property taxes through the Industrial Tax Exemption Program and receive a payroll tax rebate from the state via the Quality Jobs program.

In his Sept. 16 executive order, the governor pointed to low jobs numbers as the reason for his fast-tracking initiative while deflecting blame for Louisiana’s sluggish economy. He claimed the state lost 12,000 jobs from 2016-23. Although the figure is technically accurate, by framing the data between those years without context, Landry’s executive order implied his predecessor, Gov. John Bel Edwards, was responsible for the job losses.

Louisiana actually gained about 7,000 jobs during Edwards’ first term and, like other states, suffered a sudden employment drop in March 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state’s employment numbers rebounded during Edwards’ second term, though the job market didn’t fully recover to its pre-pandemic mark until this January.

Federal data shows Louisiana’s employment numbers under Landry have so far hovered around and slightly above peak figures during Edwards’ tenure at around 2 million jobs. The state has slowly but steadily added jobs from January 2024, when Landry took office, through at least August 2025. The jobs market has become murkier in recent months because the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not collect monthly employment data during the six week government shutdown that began Oct. 1.

“I’m tired of hearing ‘jobs, jobs, jobs,’” Joseph told LED officials at Wednesday’s hearing. “We don’t get these jobs. They’re not for us.”

Modeste resident Twila Collins, who works with Rural Roots, told the agency the jobs claims often don’t benefit long-time local residents. Instead, she said, they see the ill effects of heavy pollution that often comes with industrial facilities.

Ascension Parish lies in an industrial corridor along the Mississippi River referred to as “Cancer Alley” for its high concentration of industrial pollution containing carcinogens. Scientific studies have linked cancer rates in its communities to the toxic pollution, though the state Department of Environmental Quality rejects such findings.

“I had to watch my child die in the same area,” Collins said at the hearing. In a later interview, she explained that her 9-year-old son, Denzel, died of an asthma attack more than two decades ago.

Gramercy resident Gail LeBoeuf, who was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2022 and founded the activist group Inclusive Louisiana, told agency staff industrial expansion isn’t worth the risk it poses to the people.

“Economic development has not happened for us,” LeBoeuf said. “These deals don’t do anything but give money back to the people that promised to bring economic development.”

Anne Rolfes, executive director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said the Louisiana Economic Development agency is “pretending” that Hyundai and CF Industries are the solutions to poverty.

“This is destruction masquerading as economic development,” Rolfes said.

Wagner, the spokesperson for Louisiana Economic Development, said the Landry administration will “never apologize” for attracting jobs, wages and new opportunities to the state.

“The Governor and Secretary both firmly believe the absolute best way to lift people out of poverty is by giving them access to ever-growing wages,” Wagner said via email. “Anyone who would reject those opportunities clearly does not have the best interest of Louisiana citizens at heart.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LED-hearing-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:00:41.019317

Tennessee lawmakers added $50 million to the state budget during the 2025 session to support the small module reactor project.
The governor spearheaded the creation of the $70 million Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023.
“They talk a good game but they’re not deploying it as fast as what’s happening in Florida, Georgia or North Carolina.” Discussion about the Clinch River small module reactor project is just beginning.
TVA said in a news release that the small modular reactor would not be online until the early 2030s.","(The Center Square) – Tennessee is poised to become the first state to construct a small modular nuclear reactor, in part using a $400 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Some are questioning whether it could alleviate a growing need for energy while costing taxpayers.

The Tennessee Valley Authority will construct the reactor on the Clinch River near Oak Ridge, which is a hub of nuclear energy activity in East Tennessee.

“As AI, data centers, and digital infrastructure drive unprecedented energy demand, we’re building our nation’s nuclear energy foundation right here in the Tennessee Valley,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO. “This is about more than innovation, it’s about creating lasting opportunity, lowering energy costs, and securing a better tomorrow for American families today.”

TVA officials said in a release that the utility is positioning itself to shield consumers from footing the bill for the development costs.

Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said his organization is open to new technologies that don’t emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But he is skeptical that the project will be cost-effective for Tennessee Valley consumers.

“There’s a whole question that we just had a big election where energy affordability is a big part of it,” Smith said. “Throwing money after a reactor design that isn’t cost effective isn’t a good investment both by the taxpayers of the United States because that $400 million didn’t just appear, it’s coming from the taxpayers of the United States and ultimately the rate payers, the customers who pay their bill to TVA may have to pay higher electric bills.”

Nuclear power’s popularity fizzled after several high-profile nuclear accidents in the late 20th century but interest sparked again in the 2000s.

Tennessee’s southern neighbor, Georgia, began construction on Plant Vogtle, a large-scale nuclear project in the late 2000s, which actually led to an increase in costs for consumers in that state, according to The American Legislative Exchange Council’s Energy Affordability 2025 report. The project was marked by delays and cost overruns, which ultimately increased the project’s total to $35 billion. Georgia ratepayers were left with $7.5 billion in construction costs, according to previous reports.

“While prices could have been lower if Georgia’s Vogtle nuclear generators had come online on schedule, the project slowed, and costs rose,” the report said.

Gov. Bill Lee is a strong supporter of nuclear energy. Tennessee lawmakers added $50 million to the state budget during the 2025 session to support the small module reactor project.

“Today’s announcement marks a significant milestone for America’s energy dominance and underscores Tennessee’s position as a leader in clean, reliable nuclear energy to power the future,” Lee said in a statement after the award was announced.

The governor spearheaded the creation of the $70 million Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023. The money has attracted projects from Orano, Type One, BWXT Enrichment, Oklo and Radiant Industries. The projects are a $7.3 billion investment and created 2,000 new jobs, according to Lee’s office.

Smith said his organization does not recommend a “do nothing” approach to the increasing energy needs. But other clean energy options like solar and wind have been “kneecapped” by the Trump administration, he said.

“TVA is way behind on developing solar energy compared to its peers in the Southeast,” Smith said. “They talk a good game but they’re not deploying it as fast as what’s happening in Florida, Georgia or North Carolina.”

“The climate is having a very significant effect on this bloom, but there are many underlying drivers of climate change,” Dr. Lapointe said.
” Dr. Hu and his colleagues used satellite imagery of the ocean surface as well as shipboard observations to document 25 years of sargassum movement.
However, rising ocean temperatures and a series of marine heat waves have begun making the gulf too warm for Sargassum, Dr. Hu said.
“In the summer, the water is already warm, adding another 0.7 degrees is very bad,” Dr. Hu said.","A 5,500-mile blob of seaweed in the Atlantic Ocean that has menaced beaches across the Caribbean and Florida in recent years is exploding in size, while a second patch farther north is declining rapidly, driven by rapid changes in the region’s climate.

A study published Thursday in the journal Nature Geoscience finds a big shift in the growth patterns of sargassum, a type of floating macroalgae that provides food and shelter for fish, turtles, seabirds and other marine life.

The southern patch, known as the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, has now reached 38 million metric tons, a 40 percent increase from its record year of 2022.

“Usually we have a 10 percent to 20 percent fluctuation year to year,” said Chuanmin Hu, a professor of physical oceanography at the University of South Florida and an author of the paper. “But this year was crazy, and we do not have an answer of why.”

Scientists hadn’t detected sargassum in this equatorial region before 2011.

Since then, winds and ocean currents have pushed blobs of sargassum west toward coastal waters in the springtime. Beaches along Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula have suffered from smelly piles of seaweed, while the president of the Dominican Republic said in June that his nation faced a “regional emergency” from sargassum and called for action by the United Nations.

In 2023, about 13 million metric tons of sargassum covered some Florida beaches and decomposed into smelly piles before disappearing in the summer. A study that year in The Journal of Global Health by doctors on the island of Martinique reported respiratory ailments from decomposing seaweed that produces hydrogen sulfide gas.

While experts have not pinpointed the cause of the massive sargassum bloom, Saharan dust storms and smoke from African wildfires blowing west across the Atlantic are playing a role, scientists say. These tiny particles drift into the ocean and act as a kind of fertilizer for the sargassum, according to Brian Lapointe, principal investigator at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University and an author of the new paper.

“The climate is having a very significant effect on this bloom, but there are many underlying drivers of climate change,” Dr. Lapointe said. “Everything from high temperature, extreme rainfall, droughts and rainfall events, and winds. ”

Dr. Hu and his colleagues used satellite imagery of the ocean surface as well as shipboard observations to document 25 years of sargassum movement. The rapid decline of the northern patch, known as the Northern Sargasso Sea, started in 2015. The Gulf Stream current system has carried seaweed from its nursery in the western Gulf of Mexico into the Northern Sargasso Sea for centuries. However, rising ocean temperatures and a series of marine heat waves have begun making the gulf too warm for Sargassum, Dr. Hu said.

In the past 20 years, the gulf on average has warmed 0.4 degrees Celsius, or 0.72 degrees Fahrenheit, he added.

“In the summer, the water is already warm, adding another 0.7 degrees is very bad,” Dr. Hu said. “Plus we have more frequent marine heat waves in the past 10 years, so that will add to more stress to native sargassum.”

Dani Cox, an independent marine microbiologist based in Miami, said rising ocean temperatures was just one of many causes for the decline of one patch and the explosion of the other, noting that some lab experiments found that sargassum thrive in warm water while others have found the opposite.

“There’s so much going on which is why everyone is not sold on one answer,” Dr. Cox said. “All of us can only look at one or two things at a time. I absolutely think the inundations will stay the same or get worse.”

As for next year’s seaweed invasion, Dr. Lapointe said beach-lovers should stay vigilant before booking a spring break vacation, noting that the Bahamas might be a safer bet than the Yucatán.

“I would be very careful in choosing a destination,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/04/multimedia/04CLI-seaweed-qgtk/04CLI-seaweed-qgtk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 19:03:06.555871

Trump says the less stringent fuel standards will allow automakers to produce more affordable cars, cutting the price of vehicles by at least $1,000.
According to the White House, the reset will save American families $109 billion in total.
It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate.
Meanwhile, U.S. oil producers and fuel traders are the biggest winners here.","Earlier in the year, President Trump signed legislation that effectively ended fuel economy penalties for automakers. The penalties applied to automakers for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards dating back to the 2022 model year. The measure was part of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" signed into law in July 2025. And now the president has pushed the envelope further by rolling back Biden-era fuel economy standards, terming them ‘‘ridiculous.’’

Trump has officially ended CAFE rules, with automakers now required to meet just 34.5 mpg across their model fleet by 2031, much lower than 50.4 mpg that the Biden administration had imposed. Trump says the less stringent fuel standards will allow automakers to produce more affordable cars, cutting the price of vehicles by at least $1,000.

According to the White House, the reset will save American families $109 billion in total. Earlier in the year, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy claimed the Biden administration wrongly assumed that fuel economy averages for automaker fleets would automatically rise in the coming years as EV adoption accelerates.

""And we're not only talking about outside of our country, because nobody could do it. Nobody wanted to do it. And it was ridiculous, very expensive. It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate. Biden's burdensome regulations have caused the price of cars to soar more than 25%, and in one case, they went up 18% in one year,"" Trump said.

Not surprisingly, automakers are now breathing a sigh of relief, “Today is a victory for common sense and affordability,” Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley said at the event. “This is the right move … We will invest more in affordable vehicles.”

The EV sector is the biggest loser of this policy change. EV adoption in the United States remains low compared to other major world economies. Indeed, just 7.5% of new vehicle sales in the country are Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), compared to 50% in China and less than a tenth of Norway’s 80%. These rules were designed to push automakers toward producing more EVs, and their relaxation removes a primary regulatory driver for the transition to electric mobility. To exacerbate matters, the administration has canceled the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EV purchases effective September 30, a major financial incentive that helped offset the higher upfront cost of electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, U.S. oil producers and fuel traders are the biggest winners here. According to Will Anderson, zero-emission vehicles policy advocate at Public Citizen, the Biden-era regulations could have cut U.S. fuel consumption by 70 billion gallons per year, saving Americans $23 billion in fuel costs. However, the real impact is likely to come from the expected slowdown in EV sales. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has forecast that EVs will displace over 5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, or ~5% of global oil demand. Some analyses suggest that this number could be even higher, with projections of displacing 10 million barrels per day by 2035 based on announced policies. Those are big numbers by any measure, and could easily offset demand growth by other sectors.

Overall, Trump’s energy policies will have a negative effect on a cleaner America. Policies supporting electric vehicles and wind/solar projects have been targeted, including restrictions on tax credits for renewable energy. The administration is also attempting to revoke California's authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal requirements. The administration has declared a national energy emergency to expedite domestic oil and gas production, including in protected offshore areas.

This emphasis on ""energy dominance"" favors traditional energy sources over renewable ones and is expected to increase the burning of fossil fuels. Numerous environmental protections have been targeted for repeal or weakening, including air and water quality standards, limits on methane emissions, and coal mining oversight. These actions are projected to increase cancer-causing pollutants like soot, benzene, and heavy metals in the air and water. The U.S. has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and the Climate Loss and Damage Fund, and rescinded domestic net-zero GHG emission goals. The ""social cost of carbon"" metric, used to justify climate regulations, is also being targeted for elimination or reduction.

Carbon Brief’s analysis shows that this means Trump’s policies will add an extra 7 billion tonnes of emissions to the environment. U.S. emissions will now effectively flatline, rather than fall by the required 40% in order to hit climate targets.

Driving the news: The Nevada formation, dubbed ""Big Blind,"" had no surface signs of geothermal activity or any prior history of exploration.

Congress and the Trump administration strongly support geothermal energy.","A geothermal energy company announced Thursday that it has discovered — with AI's help — the first commercially viable system of its kind in over 30 years.

Why it matters: Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals officials said the underground find, in a remote area of western Nevada, offers fresh evidence that geothermal can become an attractive option to meet soaring U.S. energy demand.

Geothermal is the rare alternative energy source with wide bipartisan backing. Democrats are attracted to its zero-emissions footprint, while Republicans like its potential to offer round-the-clock power.

Driving the news: The Nevada formation, dubbed ""Big Blind,"" had no surface signs of geothermal activity or any prior history of exploration.

Zanskar scientists used computer models to locate a geothermal anomaly that indicated exceptionally high heat flow at the site.

They fed data into Zanskar's AI prediction engine, which helped narrow down the list of options.

Zoom in: The result led to ""fewer bad wells"" being drilled, Joel Edwards, Zanskar's co-founder and chief technology officer, told Axios. That reduces the cost of the projects, he said.

Carl Hoiland, the company's other co-founder and CEO, said AI technology ""has allowed us to target deeper and more precisely.""

""The analogy here is really every other natural-resource industry, from oil to minerals to shale gas,"" he said. ""They all started on what was at the surface and over time got better at going deeper.""

Context: The Big Blind discovery follows Zanskar's work at two other geothermal sites — Pumpernickel in northern Nevada and Lightning Dock in New Mexico.

Unlike Big Blind, both sites had been known to have evidence of geothermal activity, but neither had been fully examined to identify their potential.

What's next: The company plans to seek permits to develop Big Blind into a commercial venture. It hopes the site will provide power by later this decade.

The big picture: The International Energy Agency predicted that geothermal could meet up to 15% of global power demand growth through 2050 — but said greater government policy support, specialized labor, and other boosts will be necessary.

Congress and the Trump administration strongly support geothermal energy. Energy Secretary Chris Wright in March called it ""an awesome resource that's under our feet"" that could provide the power needed for AI innovation.

The giant tax and spending bill that President Trump signed into law this summer cut tax credits for many renewable energy tax incentives but preserved them for geothermal.

The bottom line: ""If you sort of read the tea leaves in the public space, the perception is that naturally occurring systems are tapped out,"" Edwards said.

""This is sort of showing that, actually, there's a wave of these things coming, and this is just the beginning.""",https://images.axios.com/nH5_uZP_Ja7v8mPFBwlT_gCKf1I=/0x0:5088x2862/1366x768/2025/12/02/1764698063911.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 19:02:56.980046

A few weeks ago, in the middle of November, more than a hundred people showed up to make sure the Indiana Department of Environmental Management heard their opposition to a data center being built in southeast Fort Wayne.

“We’re not just here to defend our neighborhoods in the backyard of this data center, we’re here to defend everyone down river,"" Kelly Atkins said to represenatives from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management at a hearing about the latest request from the Google data center. At the end of the hearing, the crowd of speakers began chanting at the representatives; ""Deny, deny, deny.""

Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, is requesting an additional 143 diesel generators to support the campus.

To understand the opposition to the build, first, a look at how the data center came to Fort Wayne, when it was known only as “Project Zodiac.”

How the data center came to Fort Wayne

In October of 2023, what was then described as an “unnamed Fortune 100 company” proposed a data center campus around Adams Center and Paulding roads, using nearly 900 acres of land and requiring an annexation of more than 700 acres into Fort Wayne.

The months that followed included a “super-voluntary” annexation, land sale and tax abatement approvals. In January 2024, after everything was finalized, the anonymous company’s name was released; Google would be building a data center campus with up to 12 buildings.

Community development director Jonathan Leist recalled how the property sale went through.

“So we sold our portion of the property for a little less than $12 million, $11.4 (million) I believe, something like that,"" Leist said. ""So that was over and above our last appraisal that we had of the property. So definitely market rate on the land sale.”

In December 2023, Mayor Sharon Tucker was still serving as the city council representative for the sixth district, the area where the data center is currently being built. Following a visit to a similar data center in Columbus, Ohio, at the December 22, 2023 city council meeting, Tucker spoke in favor of approving the project.

“There have been a multitude of bad projects that have tried to be dumped on the south side and I have fought every single one of them,"" Tucker said at the December 2023 meeting. ""This is not one, council, that I’m fighting.”

In her visit to the campus in Columbus, joined by Leist, he said their concerns specifically about sound pollution diminished.

""I think what we saw and heard there was that the only sound really being emitted was construction,"" Leist said. ""Like there was no unique data center sound that I think people in other locations had.”

A change in the energy landscape

The Midwest has become something of a breeding ground for data centers, due to cooler temperatures that require less energy-intensive cooling than Southern states. Great Lakes states like Indiana, Ohio and Michigan have seen a boom in data center builds over the last several years.

There are 72 facilities under construction in Indiana alone.

Earlier this year, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan published a study into what happens when data centers come to towns.

The study found that, while many data centers propose to eventually run entirely on green energy, the green energy needed for that much energy running all the time isn’t currently possible.

And in cases like Fort Wayne, the company then asks for more of the old energy sources.

Molly Kleinman is the managing director of the science, technology and public policy program at the Ford School.

“I haven’t seen solid justification for the humungous embrace of as much energy, dirty as it needs to be, as we can get now, and we’ll worry about clean energy down the line,"" Kleinman said.

But it isn’t just about not using green energy. In many cases, the issue is the way data centers have increased reliance on fossil fuels. In many areas, increased energy needs from data centers are helping coal and gas plants slated for closure to find a second life.

“We’ve seen that data centers have eaten up all of the renewable capacity that the countries added over the last several years, and then gone beyond it,"" Kleinman said. ""They have essentially canceled out all of the gains that we had previously made in renewables.”

Bryce Gustafson is program organizer with Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group based out of Indianapolis.

“This may come as a shock to some people, but Indiana was on a trajectory of getting away from fossil fuels,"" he said. ""This has completely upended that trajectory.”

Indiana Michigan Power just got permission to acquire an existing 870-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Ohio. NIPSCO announced plans in September to build a natural gas plant, through separate company NIPSCO GenCo, to address the increased needs from data centers throughout the state.

A large investment to the city

When city officials approved the Google data center for southeast Fort Wayne, they agreed to a somewhat unusual tax abatement. Fort Wayne community development director Jonathan Leist explains;

""We knew we were up against some other locations, some other states, so we wanted to be competitive. And so rather than our traditional phase in which has a lower amount in the beginning of taxes paid and a higher amount abated, the company, they were comfortable, and we were comfortable with a 50% kind of across the board, which actually ends up being about the same amount as you would get on a 10 year.”

That means that in the year 2025, it changed how the property was evaluated and Google is expected to pay $1 million in property taxes this year. In an area of the city that’s already facing a $3 million cut in city investments, that $1 million is significant.

And, at the end of the full build on the property, Google will generate about $5.9 million per year in property taxes, according to Leist.

“So in this case, a very large investment,"" he said. ""Larger than probably anything we had seen at least in the last five years, for sure, probably 10 years or more.”

In the nearly two years since the project was approved, Google has invested money through grants and donations into the community.

In April of 2024, the data center broke ground and, at that groundbreaking, announced initial investments to the Fort Wayne Early Learning Center and Just Neighbors Interfaith Homeless Network.

In October of this year, the Allen County Public Library received a $35,000 grant from Google for the Rolland Center for Lincoln Research.

Bryce Gustafson, program organizer with Citizens Action Coalition, says companies should give back to the communities they’re building in, but he questioned if what they’re giving is enough.

“I don’t begrudge that but, also, you have to take into account how much money they’re gonna save at the state-level through state sales tax exemptions,"" Gustafson said. ""It would be great to have those numbers to compare because in some situations I’ve seen where ‘we’re gonna give half a million dollars a year here,’ or ‘a million dollars there.’ In the grand scheme of things that’s a nickel to them.”

The environmental risks that data centers bring

With the benefit of economic impact comes potential environmental risks.

In Fort Wayne, the Google data center’s developer’s original plan

included 34 emergency diesel generators and took about three and three-quarters acres in wetlands. This year, developers were approved to take nearly 10 additional wetlands. They’ve more than quadrupled their request for diesel generators, now asking for an additional 143.

“Eighteen months ago, they knew, or should have known, at that time, that that was not enough to sustain their operations. Which means they submitted something that is in bad faith at best,"" Gina Burgess said.

Burgess showed up to speak at the hearing with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management about the request for more generators.

About 75 people spoke at that meeting, which took place in mid-November, but more than a hundred signed up to speak before the meeting ran out of time.

Every single person who spoke encouraged IDEM to deny the permit.

Resident Danielle Doepke spoke specifically about the health risks the diesel generators pose.

“Diesel exhaust has been classified as a group one carcinogen by internation and national organizations, meaning it is a definite cause of cancer in human,"" Doepke said. ""Studies have found links between diesel exhaust and cancers of the lung, bladder, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, as well as blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias.""

Residents, especially those who live on the south side, expressed concern about air pollution from the generators. Designated as emergency generators, they are only allowed to run them 100 hours a year, about four total days.

The AI ""bubble""

In September, a report found construction spending on data centers was at an all-time high of $40 billion in the U.S.

Molly Kleinman is with the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, which has been researching data centers. She says there’s a concern that most of these data centers are being built to support tech companies’ AI features and what might happen when the “AI bubble” pops.

""We’re hearing more and more experts weigh in that the way these giant data centers are being funded is not sustainable and, at some point, bubble’s pop.”

A response from city council

In October, WANE15 reported language in the contract between the city and DMI FW LLC, which bought the property for Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, included a promise the city wouldn’t turn against Google if public opinion does.

While it makes sense from a business standpoint, Bryce Gustafson with Citizens Acton Coalition said it risks public officials losing their power to listen to the public.

“Normal people just don’t have the same level of power in these issues, so if your decision makers are taking away their power, the everyday Hoosier; What kind of power do they have?"" He said.

In 2023, the city council approved the land sale to Hatchworks LLC unanimously. Though, some members of the current council had no hand in that decision.

Activist groups in Fort Wayne have recruited residents to show up at meetings like the IDEM hearing and city council over the past several weeks. They’ve been holding town halls of their own to share information about the center.

At the final city council meeting in November, residents showed up to offer further public comment to the council about the data center and Google’s request for a further 143 diesel generators.

City council has no power to deny the permit. It’s a decision that is in the hands of IDEM and subject to review by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Despite that, fifth district representative Geoff Paddock, who is serving as council president through the end of the year, announced ahead of the public comment he was sending a letter to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management about the request.

""I am asking them to sit down with us, work with us, the city of Fort Wayne, Google, the Mayor’s office, city council members who may be interested, other interested parties to find an alternative,"" Paddock said.

Once again, residents expressed their concerns about air pollution...

""I already have to carry an emergency inhaler around with me, everywhere I go,"" said one young resident who spoke at the meeting. ""I don’t really want to go outside and suffocate in the first two seconds after that data center is complete.”

Following public comment, councilmembers-at-large Chambers and Friestroffer agreed to work with Paddock, IDEM and Google to better understand the energy needs and the risks of the generators.

Sixth district councilwoman Rohli Booker attended a townhall put on by advocacy groups earlier in the month as well as the IDEM hearing. She commended those who spoke for their continued advocacy and how it has helped her advocate in meetings with Google.

“There are things that I heard at that IDEM hearing that I was able to share with them – some of the solutions, some of the concerns, some of the health implications – that if I hadn’t attended, I would not have been able to do,"" Booker said.

Booker took on the role of sixth district representative after the data center was already under way.

Amid public hearings, council meetings and town halls, one voice has been missing from the conversation about the data center – Google.

Mayor Sharon Tucker, who has been a proponent of the build since she was still serving as the city council representative for the 6th district, said she’d like Google to work with the public.

“I do wish our Google partners would do what I’ve done and try to answer those concerns and so that would probably be the one thing that I am disappointed in, that they have not answered those cries of concern,"" she said.

Google hasn’t returned a request for comment.

Following public comment at the council meeting, Chambers said the city is planning a town hall that she hopes Google will attend.

Elsewhere in Indiana, communities are beginning to reject data center builds. Marshall, White and Putnam counties have enacted moratoriums on data centers until they better understand the impacts of them.

The public comment period on the requested extra diesel generators ended November 17, and IDEM has yet to announce a decision on the permit. Due to the requirement to address all comments received, both in writing and verbally, a representative for IDEM says it may take several months for a final permitting decision to be issued.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d053d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb8%2F7d%2F756294e54ceeb4abb10e43a4af06%2Fdata-center.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:00:37.292663

New Mexico continues to receive the largest payments, accounting for nearly 70% of state disbursements.
For Wyoming, the next largest recipient of revenue payments, Smith said the story is all about declining coal revenues.
Utah also saw drops, though it did gain more revenue from geothermal energy production ($5 million).
“You don't wanna be dependent on revenue that just goes poof and isn't there next year.” Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, California and Alaska also received millions in energy revenue payments.","U.S. states are getting about $4 billion in payments from the federal government this year from energy development revenue on federal land.

The federal government collects these dollars from energy companies for rent, royalties and lease fees. Then it disperses some of that back to individual states. States later use the funds to pay for day-to-day spending and savings.

New Mexico continues to receive the largest payments, accounting for nearly 70% of state disbursements. It received almost $3 billion in the 2025 fiscal year.

That’s because the state partially sits on top of the oil-rich Permian Basin, according to Kristin Smith, a researcher at the Montana-based nonprofit, Headwater Economics.

“If you took out New Mexico, there'd be a different story in these numbers,” Smith said.

For Wyoming, the next largest recipient of revenue payments, Smith said the story is all about declining coal revenues. The state received $544.87 million this fiscal year. That’s nearly $50,000 less than 2024 and almost $300,000 less than 2023, according to federal data.

Utah also saw drops, though it did gain more revenue from geothermal energy production ($5 million). Montana and Colorado saw upticks, largely due to oil and gas development.

Overall, the state revenue total was down slightly from previous years, which the Trump administration blamed on a drop in commodity prices. A U.S. Department of Interior press release said the administration’s efforts to unleash American energy helped unlock those dollars.

However, Smith said the market often plays a bigger role in revenue totals than federal policy.

“When you think about where are the places that are benefiting the most or the least, or who's experiencing changes, that is often dictated by market and commodity prices,” Smith said.

She added that this revenue source is volatile, and states should rely on it less for day-to-day spending and invest more in long-term savings.

“ There’s always a risk of economic dependance,” Smith said. “You don't wanna be dependent on revenue that just goes poof and isn't there next year.”

Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, California and Alaska also received millions in energy revenue payments.

View Profile","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has signaled it will once again examine formaldehyde under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

It is not a surprise. Formaldehyde is one of the most exhaustively used, and therefore studied and regulated, chemicals. Scientists lament that it keeps being a political football due to misunderstandings of one of the most basic tenets of chemistry; the dose makes the poison. For example, various environmental groups insisted for decades that formaldehyde in vaccines was 'probably' a key cause of autism diagnoses, along with many other things, while scientists tried in vain to note that a single pear has 120X the formaldehyde found in a vaccine, and you're only taking a vaccine once. Yet if you ignore science and only believe epidemiology, formaldehyde is used more than 40 years ago and vaccine diagnoses went up so they insist the chemical must be causing it.

It does not work that way. You simply are not getting enough to harm you unless you fall into a vat of it and drown. It's a chemical intermediate, so it becomes converted into other chemicals in processes that lead to a final product. Just because it is in products does not mean you are ingesting formaldehyde. So little formaldehyde remains in products you have to believe in homeopathy to think you are getting enough to matter. Nearly all of it is instead found in nature so humans would have alarming health issues if it were a problem.

You're not getting enough in vaccines or food or flooring to worry about; unless you think a pinch of salt in 120 Olympic-sized swimming pools is changing your hormones.

CH2O. Not so scary when you ignore the hype and look at the science.

The downside to having it in use is nothing. The upside is that it makes a lot of products affordable in a way alternatives cannot. Formaldehyde is a chemical chemical in a chain of 1,500,000 jobs and $1,600,000,000,000 in manufacturing.

Because of its importance, and its ubiquity, it is important that it be reviewed regularly. Not in a 'scientists need to keep reviewing it until they agree with Sierra Club' way that some administrations have done, but in a thoughtful, rigorous manner. Using science, not just epidemiological correlation in surveys or dead mice.

That is why the EPA taking another look at formaldehyde is a win for public trust in science, especially during the period since 2009 when people are unsure what it science and what is politicization of science. Activists try to claim that an examination of a chemical means it must be risky. It does not. It only means it is popular.

Here are the important things to know:

1. Does it cause cancer? No. EPA has never said it does nor has any science body.

2. Is it harmful in air? No. You are fine even living next to a chemical plant that makes it. And no one lives that close.

3. Is it harmful in water? No. The alcohol in alcoholic beverages is harmful, not the formaldehyde which occurs naturally in alcoholic beverages. Even Korean Soju, which used to be the delight of adventurous Americans because it contained 'embalming fluid', only has as much as the pear mentioned above, and less than wine.

4. Are unprotected workers at risk? Yes, if they don't wear masks. EPA cautions about that because while they know companies mandate protective gear, they do not know that workers will always use it.

5. Are unprotected consumers at risk? Yes. Like most chemicals, there are warnings about eye irritation when this is used at high levels without protective gear.

So why is EPA looking at it again? The last assessment of formaldehyde delighted environmental lawyers but was controversial in the science community. Instead of using rigorous, transparent methods they abdicated the work to their Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program, an administrative group created to help EPA do research and then bizarrely (and illegally, if government were not so bloated it has bigger problems to solve) began to issue its own risk assessments.

The group has never been respected by scientists, they are like that uncle who spouts food coloring conspiracy theories at Christmas dinner, but they are not usually anti-science fifth columnists like they have been for the last few years. The National Academies of Science (NAS) has criticized IRIS for “recurring problems with clarity and transparency of the methods” they use in making their claims while the Government Accountability Office (GAO) doesn't think IRIS has any value at all.

GAO is right. For example, IRIS created a reference dose for acetone that defies scientific comprehension. If IRIS had any authority, human breast milk would be banned because the acetone produced by mothers is twice their reference dose. Government would have to ban orange juice due to methanol.

Back to formaldehyde. IRIS created a safety standard of 0.008 parts per billion (ppb).Human breath is 8 ppb. With each breath humans are exposing themselves to 1000X the IRIS safe level. If IRIS had any standing, human breath would be banned even faster than human breast milk.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration's EPA was in an overt war on science. Not just weedkillers, where they did strange things like go to court against their own scientists to undo science-based regulations and replace them with epidemiology. They also began the process to create a de facto ban on formaldehyde by using IRIS beliefs rather than science.

A spreadsheet created using surveys is not how science should be done but because it was done, EPA now has to go and do the science all over again.

Grid congestion, soaring electricity costs, and macroeconomic uncertainty are delaying expansions and straining supply chains across the food processing sector, according to the Kilowatts into Calories: Surveying Food Processors on Energy Challenges report.

Key findings from 145 senior energy decision-makers include:

57% of food processors planning expansions face challenges securing grid power.

52% report their electric utilities lack sufficient capacity for growth.

7 in 10 are waiting at least three years for upgrades; some have reported wait times stretching beyond six years.

91% pay above the $0.08/kWh U.S. industrial average; nearly half saw costs rise 26% or more over five years.

81% use backup generators, yet 63% lack enough capacity for outages beyond a few hours.

For decades, food processing facilities secured large-scale utility interconnections with relative ease. After the artificial intelligence (AI) industry took off, food processors are now in competition with data centers to secure scarce electricity from the grid, and this scarcity is driving up wait times and energy costs. This is the first industry survey to measure how the U.S. F&B and CPG industries are adapting to the unfolding energy crunch. The results convey just how much these industries are facing energy disruption — and the ways they’re finding creative solutions.

“This survey data points to the reality of systemic energy risk,” said Juan Macias, CEO of AlphaStruxure. “The issues food processors are facing – delays, outages, and sudden rate increases — are now increasingly common. For instance, we know of food processors that have already broken ground on new facilities, only to discover they can’t get power to the site by the time their facility opens. That’s why we’re seeing the industry turning toward alternative energy solutions.”

“America’s aging grid and surging demand are creating new risks for energy-intensive industries,” said David Cooper, Director of CPG, North America, at Schneider Electric. “We’re seeing more frequent outages and higher costs, especially in regions like California. Our research shows that nearly half of processors have seen energy costs spike by more than 25% in five years.”

Great British Energy (GBE) has marked a significant moment in the UK’s energy transition with the publication of its first Strategic Plan, setting out how the new publicly owned company intends to turn political ambition into bricks, steel and megawatts over the rest of the decade.

Launched in 2024 and backed by over £8.3 billion in capital alongside its sister company GBE Nuclear, GBE was created to act as a national champion for clean, home-grown energy. Its remit is deliberately broad: accelerate deployment of renewables and storage, strengthen industrial supply chains, and ensure that the economic and social dividends of the transition flow back to UK workers, communities and taxpayers.

From remit to measurable outcomes

The new Plan translates that remit into a clear set of outcomes. By 2030, GBE expects its investments to help deliver at least 15 gigawatts of clean generation and storage – enough to power the equivalent of almost ten million homes – and to mobilise around £15 billion of private capital over time through long term partnerships and co investment. It also promises support for more than 1,000 local and community energy projects and at least 10,000 jobs, with a particular focus on places historically dependent on oil and gas. Returns from the assets GBE owns on the public’s behalf will be ploughed back into new capacity and further opportunities.

Public ownership with purpose

Chief Executive Dan McGrail describes this as “public ownership with purpose” rather than a return to an old style, centralised utility model. GBE will act as a developer and equity investor, not simply a funding agency. By taking carefully judged risks in areas where private capital is hesitant – for example emerging technologies, earlier stage projects or new commercial models – it aims to de risk projects and crowd in private partners, rather than crowd them out.

British resources, British engineering, British ownership

Chair Juergen Maier situates this approach in a wider story about industrial renewal. After decades in which key energy assets have been sold overseas and domestic manufacturing hollowed out, GBE is intended as part of a new settlement: British resources, British engineering and British ownership working together to deliver clean power, secure supply and high-quality employment. That ambition is given concrete expression in the Plan through a dedicated £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme, which will target supply chain bottlenecks, support factories and skills, and align with the government’s Industrial Strategy and Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan.

The scale of the challenge

Underpinning all of this is a stark assessment of the challenge. National Energy System Operator analysis shows that electricity demand will rise sharply as transport, heating, industry and data centres electrify. By 2035 Britain may need tens of gigawatts more capacity than is currently in the pipeline, and key technologies such as offshore wind will have to scale many times over to keep the UK on track for net zero and to avoid continued exposure to fossil fuel price shocks.

Three investment priorities for Great British Energy

GBE’s response is organised around three investment priorities.

GBE Local: making community energy mainstream: The first is GBE Local, a business line dedicated to making local and community energy mainstream. Here GBE will work alongside the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero on a joint Local Power Plan, due in 2026, which will articulate a shared vision for community and municipal renewables, clarify institutional roles, and tackle the policy and finance barriers that have held the sector back. The aim is not only to add clean generation, but to hard wire public participation and benefit into the transition through grants, concessional loans, shared ownership models and blended finance. Evidence cited in the Plan suggests that community ownership improves public acceptance, unlocks additional capital through community share offers and enhances system resilience by spreading generation. GBE Local is already visible on the ground. A £255 million solar scheme is cutting bills in around 250 schools, more than 270 NHS sites and a number of military estates, with lifetime savings expected to run into hundreds of millions of pounds and be reinvested in frontline services. The GBE Community Fund is backing early-stage community energy projects, helping local groups turn ideas into investable proposals. Over time, an open access GBE Local platform will offer an end-to-end route for councils, housing providers, community organisations and others to develop onsite generation, aggregating demand and creating a trusted delivery partner network.

Onshore Energy: unlocking public land: The second priority is Onshore Energy, where GBE will focus on unlocking the potential of public land and investing strategically in generation and storage that can provide flexibility and support grid stability. In practice this is likely to mean onshore wind and solar, batteries and other forms of flexible capacity, developed in partnership with public landowners and private developers. The Plan signals an intention to evolve this into a fully-fledged independent power producer business over time, building in house development capability and expertise across a range of technologies.

Offshore Energy: scaling the next wave of wind: The third pillar is Offshore Energy, particularly floating and deep-water wind in Scottish and Celtic Sea waters. These projects are central to future scenarios that see offshore wind capacity rising several fold by the mid-2030s, yet only a small fraction of the required floating capacity has been deployed to date. GBE will work to de risk this frontier, supporting pre commercial projects and investing in shared infrastructure and supply chains that can anchor long term growth.

Working with markets, not replacing them

Throughout, GBE stresses that it is not a substitute for the wider market. The Plan repeatedly emphasises collaboration: more than 100 organisations contributed to its development through workshops and roundtables in Edinburgh, London, Belfast and Cardiff. The company expects to partner with private developers, institutional investors, local authorities and community groups, offering not just capital but technical expertise, templates and guidance to help structure projects and embed community benefit.

From slogan to strategy

Politically, the Plan allows ministers to demonstrate that GBE is more than a slogan. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband presents the company as a national champion that will help the UK “reap the benefits of Britain’s natural resources” and deliver “an abundance of clean, homegrown energy for British people and thousands of good jobs across the country”. The document anchors that rhetoric in specific metrics, timelines and programmes, while also making clear that GBE operates at arm’s length from government, with independence framed as essential to making credible, evidence-based investment decisions.

Uncertainties, learning and adaptation

There are, of course, open questions. The Plan is candid that GBE is at the start of its journey and that the next few years will focus on building core capabilities, recruiting and developing its workforce, and delivering early commercial successes that prove the model. It also acknowledges that electricity demand growth, technology costs and policy frameworks remain uncertain, requiring the organisation to update its strategy every two years and adapt as markets evolve.

A fairer, faster energy future

Nonetheless, today’s publication is a clear statement of intent. It sketches a future in which the UK’s shift to clean energy is not only faster, but fairer: with communities owning assets in their area, public services cutting bills through onsite generation, and British factories and engineers supplying more of the kit that keeps the lights on. If GBE can deliver on its promise to combine public purpose with commercial discipline, it will become a central institution in that story – and a visible symbol of the UK choosing to lead, rather than follow, in the next energy era.

Report Summary

GBE has today published its first Strategic Plan, setting out how the UK’s new publicly owned energy company will accelerate clean power deployment, crowd in private investment, and expand public and community ownership of energy assets over the rest of this decade. The Plan is GBE’s formal response to the Energy Secretary’s Statement of Strategic Priorities and covers its initial five-year planning horizon, while looking ahead to 2035, 2050 and beyond.

GBE’s mission is framed as “public ownership of energy with purpose”: using public capital and an active developer role to accelerate clean generation and the industries that support it, while ensuring that workers and communities share in the benefits of home grown, secure energy. The company will develop, own and operate clean energy assets, taking equity stakes and recycling returns into further projects rather than distributing profits to shareholders.

From GBE spend between now and 2030, the Plan commits to a portfolio that will deliver at least 15 gigawatts of clean generation and storage capacity, mobilise around £15 billion of private finance over time, support more than 1,000 local and community energy projects, and directly back over 10,000 jobs, including in areas historically reliant on oil and gas. By 2030 GBE expects to have an income generating portfolio and to be on a pathway to whole company profitability in the longer term.

Delivery will be organised around three priority business areas. GBE Local will scale local and community energy, including through a joint Local Power Plan with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero that will clarify roles, address policy and regulatory barriers, and provide grants, concessional loans and blended finance to unlock projects. Onshore Energy will focus on unlocking the energy potential of public land and investing in flexible generation and storage that support grid stability. Offshore Energy will concentrate on deep water floating wind in Scotland and the Celtic Sea, where GBE aims to help close the gap between current deployment and the levels required under future energy scenarios.

Across these priorities, a £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme will support domestic supply chains, manufacturing and skills so that more of the value from the energy transition is retained in the UK. Early activity includes a £255 million solar programme for schools, hospitals and military sites and the GBE Community Fund, which provides grants to community energy schemes.

GBE is headquartered in Aberdeen and operates independently of government within the framework of the Great British Energy Act and the Statement of Strategic Priorities. The Plan positions the organisation as a long-term national institution, working in partnership with industry, investors, local government and communities to deliver an energy system that is “clean, secure, yours”.

In addition to responding to high levels of PFAS in agricultural land, Maine was the first state to pass a rule requiring manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in products.
“The state of Maine has been on the forefront of these efforts, but additional federal investments are vitally needed,” King said in a news release.
The federal legislation would also create a USDA task force that would identify ways to bring more resources to farmers through existing programs.
“They deserve federal support that matches the scale of the crisis.”","Building upon efforts underway in their home state, Maine’s congressional delegation on Thursday renewed its push for federal support for farmers affected by forever chemicals.

U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, reintroduced legislation that would offer grants to states that could be used in a variety of ways to address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, in farmland. The money could be used to test for and remediate PFAS, as well as help farmers relocate from contaminated land, according to a news release from Pingree’s office.

The bill, known as Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act, was originally cosponsored by the other members of Maine’s delegation, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden.

Collins said the U.S. Department of Agriculture “must provide support to our nation’s farmers, who through no fault of their own are at risk of losing their livelihoods,” adding that the federal government’s response has failed to keep pace with the problem.

Maine is regarded as a national leader for its work to implement policies that stymie the spread of PFAS, which is a known carcinogen linked to an array of health issues. Many farmers have seen their land, and even their own bodies, contaminated by the substance because of the historic practice of spreading sewage sludge as a fertilizer.

In addition to responding to high levels of PFAS in agricultural land, Maine was the first state to pass a rule requiring manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in products. Earlier this year, state lawmakers also worked on proposals to expand testing for contaminants in private wells and rid the state of PFAS-laden firefighting foam, which is another significant source of contamination.

Additionally, Maine lawmakers passed legislation to codify programs that support farms with high levels of PFAS into state law to ensure the assistance for farmers and remediation can continue. In August, Massachusetts lawmakers visited the Pine Tree State to learn more about how they can replicate those efforts back home.

“The state of Maine has been on the forefront of these efforts, but additional federal investments are vitally needed,” King said in a news release.

The federal bill that Collins and Pingree reupped could provide those additional investments. If passed, the money authorized by that legislation could increase capacity for soil and water testing, monitor individuals’ blood levels for PFAS contamination or even upgrade equipment to help farms stay profitable.

That money could also be used to develop education programs that would inform farmers on what to do if their land is contaminated or research the viability of new remediation systems for soil and water on farms.

The federal legislation would also create a USDA task force that would identify ways to bring more resources to farmers through existing programs. It would also provide technical assistance to states so they can coordinate effective responses to contamination.

“For farmers already navigating thin margins, discovering ‘forever chemicals’ on their land can mean lost income, unusable land, and questions about the safety of their crops and livestock,” said Pingree, who is also a longtime farmer. “They deserve federal support that matches the scale of the crisis.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6868-scaled-e1744833308558-2048x1494.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 18:03:59.862051

I’m dealing with a little warm weather inside my house.” Diving into her bills, Tate found something surprising.
Increasingly, the costs of meeting those goals are showing up on utility bills around the country.
Across the country, the rising costs of updating aging energy infrastructure are inflating bills.
Electric utilities are making “essential investments” to strengthen the grid, said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utility trade group.","Stephanie Tate couldn’t figure it out. After three years of living in her new Illinois home, her winter energy costs last year suddenly spiked to $400 per month.

She had three different technicians come to look at her HVAC system and furnace, but nothing was wrong with it. She had her home insulation inspected and found no issues. She installed new, energy efficient windows to stop cold air from leaking into the house.

“It still didn’t make a dent,” she said.

In the summer, her bills were even higher, driven by the cost of the electricity needed to run her air conditioner. Tate tried to use her heat and cooling sparingly in hot and cold months.

“In the winter, I keep my heat well below 68 — and it gets cold here, so you just bundle up,” Tate said. “In the summer, my AC is at 75. I’m dealing with a little warm weather inside my house.”

Diving into her bills, Tate found something surprising. Her electricity bill’s delivery fees — the costs customers pay to help maintain electric infrastructure like the poles and wires carrying power to their homes — were often just as high as the cost of the electricity she used.

“That’s ridiculous,” she said. “You’re paying more for everything right now, and the electrical costs — the way they increase so exponentially and so quickly is stunning to me.”

Around the country, customers like Tate are getting sticker shock when they open their monthly utility bills. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4%, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Tate’s home state of Illinois had the third-highest increase nationwide, with a 20.6% jump year-over-year, behind the District of Columbia and New Jersey.

And electricity rates themselves — a bill’s “supply charges,” — don’t explain the total increase, because they don’t include those electric infrastructure “delivery charges” like Tate found.

Cost increases in Tate’s area are largely about the cost of generating electricity, said a spokesperson for Ameren, the Illinois and Missouri-based utility that Tate uses. The company doesn’t generate power itself in Illinois, and has to buy it from third-party suppliers, which can result in big price fluctuations during high-demand times, like summer.

But, like many other utilities, Ameren is also “investing in strengthening and modernizing the grid,” the spokesperson said. Increasingly, the costs of meeting those goals are showing up on utility bills around the country.

Customers often think of their utility bill as a measure of the energy they use to keep the lights on, and heat and cool their homes. But it’s also a reflection of what their utility is building or upgrading. Across the country, the rising costs of updating aging energy infrastructure are inflating bills.

The nation’s electricity infrastructure is old, and utilities across the country have recently been pouring money into upgrading it; in just five years, US utilities increased their spending by $5 billion on transmission (the massive high-voltage towers carrying electricity from one region to another) and another $16 billion on distribution (the smaller substations, poles and wires).

Electric utilities are making “essential investments” to strengthen the grid, said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utility trade group.

“Our electric grid is America’s most important machine — and we have to make sure it works reliably every day for families, businesses, and local communities,” Maloney said in a statement to CNN.

Part of that investment is driven by new demand growth. Electricity demand in the US used to be pretty flat. Now, demand is exploding primarily from data centers, along with new manufacturing and home and vehicle electrification. Power demand from data centers alone is projected to reach 106 gigawatts in the next decade, according to a report from research firm BloombergNEF.

“Over the last decade or two, we’ve been able to get by with the grid that we have,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the research and consulting firm Brattle Group and author of a recent study on electricity prices. “The unfortunate thing is, we’ve been needing to make those investments to basically tread water and keep the grid as reliable as it has been in the past, at a time when the cost of that equipment has been getting more expensive.”

New demand is coming at a pricey time for upgrades. The Covid-19 pandemic thrust global supply chains into chaos and made everything more expensive. As a result, the cost of some electrical equipment like transformers has risen faster than the rate of inflation, Hledik said.

Electrical systems have also taken beatings from flooding, high winds and wildfires, and companies often need to invest more to try to make systems more resilient to future storms.

“The grid is being updated, but it’s definitely still old,” Hledik said. “We’re continuing to confront the reality of more volatile weather conditions. So, it’s not my expectation that the need for this investment is going to be finished” anytime soon.

In some cities around the country, the same is true for the network of gas pipelines that deliver winter heating fuel to millions of homes. There was a customer outcry in Baltimore earlier this year as winter heating costs shot monthly bills above $1,000 for some residents.

Those spikes related to seasonal heating needs were also driven by the cost of replacing (extremely) old equipment. Baltimore Gas and Electric operates the oldest gas system in the country and is replacing hundreds of miles of the most ancient, leakiest iron and steel pipes in the ground, CNN recently reported. One pipe scheduled for replacement this year was first installed during Ulysses S. Grant’s presidency in the 1800s, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos told CNN.

“Our hundreds of miles of century-old gas main is far past the end of its useful life,” Alexopulos said. “We’ve got to upgrade this system.”

BGE crews have already replaced around 600 miles of elderly metal pipes with new, plastic ones and have around 800 miles left to complete, Alexopulos said.

In Illinois, Stephanie Tate got so fed up with her electricity bills that she decided this year to take the plunge and outfit her house with solar panels and a battery storage system, which she expects to be producing power soon.

Tate said she was “stunned” at how expensive her home solar and battery system was, but she expects state and federal tax credits and rebates will cover half of the cost. She plans to pay off the remaining balance in a year and expects the new system will save her thousands of dollars per year on her utility bills.

“I’m extraordinarily excited,” she told CNN. “Every day it’s sunny outside, I’m like, ‘oh gosh, I missed this day with solar. I wish it was up now so that I could reap the benefits.’”

She’s looking forward to having a cooler temperature in her house this summer and also anticipating a more reliable home system that will keep her power on during severe spring storms that can knock electricity out for days.

“Those batteries will run even when Ameren is offline,” Tate said.

She’s hopeful she’ll see her monthly bill reduced to a shell of its former self. However, Tate won’t be completely off the grid; she’ll still have to pay delivery fees to Ameren to remain connected to their system, even as she’s generating and storing her own power. Nevertheless, she remains optimistic.

“I’m just incredibly frustrated with the high bills,” she said. “It doesn’t seem logical that they should be this high, this quick.”

Switching to solar and batteries is “a leap of faith,” she said.

Market Expansion Amazon is present worldwide, which could require Rivian delivery vans to be used outside North America, where the EV maker currently operates.
Recently, the company began hiring for the Mobile Support Service in the country, which will service fleet customers directly at their location.
However, it is unclear whether the company intends to produce electric delivery vans in right-hand drive as well.","Amazon is reportedly preparing to quit its partnership with the US Postal Service by the end of 2026, as it focuses on expanding its own delivery network in both the United States and globally.

The information was reported by The Washington Post — owned by Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos — on Thursday, which cited three people familiar with the matter.

The USPS had about 7.5% of its revenue last year tied to the retail giant.

The service has faced multibillion-dollar losses over the past decade, with Congress approving a $107 billion financial assistance package to support it in 2022.

The media outlet further noted that these plans could change, as the two companies still aim to reach an agreement.

Approached by The Washington Post, Amazon‘s spokesperson Steve Kelly called the USPS a “long-standing and trusted partner” and added that the retail giant is seeking ways to extend their partnership.

However, if the deal falls through, Amazon will need to further expand its internal delivery network.

This would involve both increasing the number of delivery service partners and adding more vehicles from its partnered brands — such as Rivian.

Delivery Fleet

Amazon has been testing and including several electric delivery vehicles from different brands in its fleet.

The delivery fleet includes electric heavy trucks and delivery vans from Mercedes-Benz.

Just a couple of months ago, the retail giant was seen testing General Motors‘ BrightDrop vans — weeks before the Detroit automaker halted production of these vehicles.

However, most of Amazon‘s delivery fleet consists of Rivian electric delivery vans.

Amazon ordered 100,000 EDVs in 2019, to be delivered by 2030, as part of its early investment in the EV maker, and began deploying them in mid-2022.

As of the latest update in late October, Amazon‘s fleet included more than 35,000 Rivian EDVs — not only in the United States, but also in Canada, where the first units were recently delivered, and in Europe.

Despite the ramp-up being slower than originally expected, the company expects it “to grow quite meaningfully as we look at going into 2o26 and 2027.”

Outlook

When questioned if the 100,000 Amazon units were still on track, founder and CEO RJ Scaringe reaffirmed the target and said that Rivian is already “thinking about what comes beyond that initial 100,000 unit contract.”

Although Amazon has not officially confirmed a contract expansion, it has indirectly extended its collaboration with Rivian by signing a deal with Also, its micro-electric mobility spin-off.

Upon unveiling its first product(s), Also announced that it will provide Amazon with thousands of its new pedal-assist cargo quad vehicles.

These vehicles are large enough to carry over 400 pounds of packages, yet compact enough to operate safely in a bike lane.

Market Expansion

Amazon is present worldwide, which could require Rivian delivery vans to be used outside North America, where the EV maker currently operates.

Although Rivian is not yet selling in Europe (planned for 2027), it already has a presence there, managing repair services for the EVs Amazon has deployed on the continent.

The first commercial vans from the EV maker were first seen in Germany two years ago.

Recently, the company began hiring for the Mobile Support Service in the country, which will service fleet customers directly at their location.

According to RJ Scaringe, Rivian will launch in Europe next year with the R2 SUV — which will also be offered in right-hand drive versions, signaling its entry in the UK.

However, it is unclear whether the company intends to produce electric delivery vans in right-hand drive as well.

Last month, Amazon announced that “over 800 new Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans will arrive in the UK in the coming months and will be deployed for Amazon deliveries.”

Rivian opened orders for fleet customers (besides Amazon) earlier this year, adding two food-related companies to its client base so far.

Other companies have been spotted testing the vans, though no official announcement has been made yet.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian_CEO__RJ_Scaringe__at_the_Amazon_Custom_Electric_Delivery_Vehicle_Launch_Event_idx7xx-optimized.webp,N,,2025-12-04 17:02:36.411468

And DOE will no longer provide technical assistance related to the national definition.
“It also would reduce energy waste, at a time when energy demand is at an all-time high, and lead to lower utility bills.
With all the rollbacks of energy efficiency standards and clean building guidelines, alongside soaring energy costs, Trump’s Energy Department is creating an actual energy emergency.” The change happened just days after the DOE renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory as “the National Laboratory of the Rockies.”","In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation issued a national definition outlining what constitutes a building as net-zero. The national definition was part of President Biden’s project to reduce U.S. building emissions 65 percent by 2035 and 90 percent by 2050.

On December 3, the DOE rescinded its definition of a zero-emissions building. DOE said in a statement this will lower costs and promote “freedom of choice” for “developers, investors, and building owners.” All of this is part of U.S. DOE secretary Chris Wright’s mandate from President Trump to “unleash [a] Golden Era of American energy dominance.”

DOE added that the definition established in 2024 was not a regulatory standard, and that compliance was voluntary. Now, the definition has been removed from the DOE’s website and informational materials. And DOE will no longer provide technical assistance related to the national definition.

The rescinding was mandated in President Trump’s Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy.” The EO said that the national definition “does not align with the [Trump] administration’s policies” because it imposes “an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources.”

The document outlining the removal was signed off on November 19 by Audrey Robertson, a DOE employee hired by Trump. Robertson previously worked for oil and gas companies; she has a board seat at Liberty Energy, a fracking services company that DOE secretary Chris Wright previously led.

“The interaction of America’s 130 million buildings with our energy system should not be further complicated by arbitrary and imprecise federal guidance,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation Lou Hrkman in a statement. “The Department will no longer make use of this definition and recommends that state and local government agencies and standard-setting bodies do the same.”

The Sierra Club, an environmentalist group, outlined its opposition to the DOE’s definition removal in a statement. Sierra Club Clean Heat Campaign Deputy Director Amneh Minkara said: “This decision by DOE to rescind the Zero Emissions Building definition is yet another move by the Trump administration that leaves consumers in the dark. This definition did not place any additional burden on builders or owners, but was a clear way to meet consumer demand for pollution-free buildings.”

“Defining what makes a building ‘zero emissions’ gives consumers certainty that when builders or sellers say a building is clean that it actually meets a specific set of criteria,” Minkara continued. “It also would reduce energy waste, at a time when energy demand is at an all-time high, and lead to lower utility bills. With all the rollbacks of energy efficiency standards and clean building guidelines, alongside soaring energy costs, Trump’s Energy Department is creating an actual energy emergency.”

“For four years, the Biden administration ignored federal law and the people who live on the North Slope, especially Kaktovik, to undercut any potential for responsible development on our Coastal Plain.
“This resolution will help restore a balanced program that ensures both responsible energy development and environmental protection.
The 2024 ROD adopted the “most restrictive” alternative, arbitrarily closing 74 percent of the Coastal Plain while making development on remaining acres impossible.
According to BLM’s own analysis, their plan would have dramatically limited (and likely fully eliminated) future production from the Coastal Plain.","WASHINGTON—Earlier today, the U.S. Senate voted to overturn an unlawful and restrictive Record of Decision (ROD) for the Coastal Plain oil and gas program that the Biden administration imposed in December 2024. The Senate moved yesterday to begin debate on S.J. Res. 91, sponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), before voting to pass H.J. Res. 131, from Congressman Nick Begich (also R-Alaska). The Senate moved the House resolution because it can go directly to the President’s desk for signature.

These disapproval resolutions overturn the Biden administration’s unilateral rewrite of the Coastal Plain program. Through its ROD, the Biden administration restricted leasing on more than 74 percent of the Coastal Plain, while layering on additional restrictions and stipulations to prevent any development of the lands theoretically left open for leasing.

“For four years, the Biden administration ignored federal law and the people who live on the North Slope, especially Kaktovik, to undercut any potential for responsible development on our Coastal Plain. They paused everything, illegally canceled every lease, and then rewrote the program to ensure that neither leasing nor development would occur. Their worldview was exactly backwards: easing up on the likes of Iran and Venezuela, while clamping down on Alaska and refusing to accept that we can safely produce from a very, very small fraction of our Coastal Plain,” Senator Murkowski said. “This resolution will help restore a balanced program that ensures both responsible energy development and environmental protection. It upholds the rule of law, bolsters our domestic energy security, and will limit the consequences of sending our dollars abroad for energy we have right here at home. I look forward to the President signing it.”

“The Biden administration’s 2024 ROD to restrict responsible development in the Coastal Plain of ANWR blatantly defied the clear language that the Alaska congressional delegation wrote in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” said Senator Sullivan. “This action—one of 70 executive orders and actions targeting Alaska—also cancelled the voices of the Native people of the region who overwhelmingly support responsible development, because it builds vital infrastructure, supports their communities, and has literally led to their residents living longer. Today, we are on the cusp of righting this wrong, rolling back the lawless lock-up of ANWR, and unleashing good-paying jobs and opportunity for Alaska’s working families. I want to thank a majority of my Senate colleagues today for passing our legislation to support Alaska’s economy, strengthen American energy security, and vindicate the rule of law and the Iñupiat people of the North Slope.”

“For years, the Biden administration ignored the law and imposed restrictive policies that effectively shut down the 1002 Area, despite its immense strategic value to Alaska and to the nation. H.J. Res. 131 reverses the Biden administration’s unlawful and restrictive Record of Decision that effectively shut down the 1002 Area of the Coastal Plain - an area Congress specifically set aside for responsible development more than forty years ago,” said Congressman Begich. “The Alaska Delegation has worked tirelessly to reverse these harmful decisions and restore access to some of the most resource-rich lands in the United States and I am grateful for the efforts. By moving swiftly to pass H.J. Res. 131, we are restoring a lawful program that balances stewardship and allows Alaska to supply the affordable and reliable energy our nation needs. I am proud to see this generational opportunity for Alaska head to the President’s Desk. America is strongest when Alaska is empowered to responsibly develop its resources.”

Background: In 1980, as part of a grand bargain to balance conservation and resource development in Alaska, Congress established the 19.3-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), an area nearly the size of South Carolina, while explicitly setting aside the 1.56-million-acre Coastal Plain for further study, exploration, and potential energy development.

In 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which established an oil and gas program for the Coastal Plain (also known as the 1002 Area) and required at least two area-wide lease sales over the next 10 years, the first by December 2021 and the second by December 2024. The 1002 Area is estimated to contain a mean of 7.7 billion barrels of oil that would help boost throughput through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which sits at one-quarter of its peak capacity. Congress authorized development of no more than 2,000 surface acres in the 1002 Area—just 0.01 percent of ANWR—to bring those barrels to market.

In December 2024, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) replaced the 2020 ROD with an unlawful plan that immediately removed more than 1.1 million acres of the Coastal Plain from oil and gas leasing. The 2024 ROD adopted the “most restrictive” alternative, arbitrarily closing 74 percent of the Coastal Plain while making development on remaining acres impossible. According to BLM’s own analysis, their plan would have dramatically limited (and likely fully eliminated) future production from the Coastal Plain. This was evidenced soon after when the administration held a lease sale that was designed to fail and predictably resulted in no bids.

The Alaska delegation wrote to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) earlier this year, requesting that the 2024 ROD be deemed a “major rule” for the purposes of the Congressional Review Act. GAO affirmatively made that determination in August 2025, leading the delegation to file identical disapproval resolutions.

The House of Representatives passed H.J. Res. 131 with bipartisan support on November 18, 2025. The measure now heads to the President’s desk.

Pfluger Leads Permitting Reform Charge to Protect States from Government Overreach,Not Available,,,,,https://pfluger.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx%3FDocumentID%3D2692,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11) is leading the charge for permitting reform in Congress, introducing legislation to protect states and industries from government overreach.
“My bill restores commonsense by preventing the EPA from punishing states for pollution they didn’t cause – including foreign emissions, cross-state transport, wildfire smoke, and mobile-source emissions outside their control.
Under current law, states can adjust their air quality plans if foreign emissions affect their ability to meet federal air standards.
The FENCES Act clarifies that all foreign emissions, whether natural or man-made, are excluded when determining whether a state meets national air quality standards or when reviewing new facility permits.
The bill also allows states to account for foreign emissions earlier in the process, rather than waiting until all other requirements are complete.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11) is leading the charge for permitting reform in Congress, introducing legislation to protect states and industries from government overreach.

The ""Foreign Emissions and Nonattainment Clarification for Economic Stability (FENCES) Act"" will ensure fair and consistent air quality designations by making clear that states will not be penalized for emissions outside U.S. borders. It will also protect producers from unnecessary compliance burdens caused by events beyond their control, such as foreign wildfires or dust storms, while upholding environmental standards under the Clean Air Act.

Read more about this legislation in E&E News, here.

“American companies are being unfairly penalized for pollution originating outside the United States. We’ve seen how even the mention of a nonattainment designation, like when the Biden EPA threatened to redesignate the Permian Basin, can create significant uncertainty for businesses and communities. These designations delay permits and hurt economic growth, while failing to address the very problem they are trying to solve,” said Rep. Pfluger. “My bill restores commonsense by preventing the EPA from punishing states for pollution they didn’t cause – including foreign emissions, cross-state transport, wildfire smoke, and mobile-source emissions outside their control. I’m proud to lead this bill as another major step in modernizing and strengthening America’s broken permitting system.”

Text of the legislation is available here.

Background:

States across the country are being unfairly penalized for pollution that originates beyond U.S. borders, including from natural events like the Canadian wildfires. Under current law, states can adjust their air quality plans if foreign emissions affect their ability to meet federal air standards. However, EPA guidance under the Biden administration limited those adjustments only to human-caused emissions, creating unnecessary hurdles for states and industries already working to comply with the Clean Air Act.

In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.
That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.
“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.
Hindered federal climate risk regulation Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.","Property insurance rates have spiked since 2021 due to the increasing frequency of climate-related natural disasters, inflation in the cost of building materials and supply chain issues. The typical homeowner saw an average increase of $648 in their annual premium from 2021 to 2024. And those rates are expected to increase by an average of 8% nationwide this year — with homeowners in some states facing much higher increases, such as a projected 27% hike in Louisiana.

An increasing number of American homeowners are linking those increases to climate change. A majority of them (72%) say that natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires exacerbated by climate change are somewhat or very responsible for the rise in homeowner insurance costs, according to a poll by Data For Progress.

There is a bipartisan consensus that prices are rising too fast — nearly 80% of homeowners in Texas, for instance, want to see rates reduced, and one-third of Florida homeowners say that rate increases are the most important issue for them (even ahead of inflation and housing costs) — though Americans are torn on the role of climate change.

Insurance companies are regulated on the state level, and there have been heated debates in states as diverse as Idaho, Minnesota, Louisiana and Colorado about policies and regulations to slow the increase in rates. In Iowa, which was expected to see a 19% increase in home insurance rates this year, nearly 180 researchers and educators signed a statement calling attention to the role of climate change in driving up insurance costs — and calling for better building standards and a faster transition to more renewable energy sources in the state, such as solar and wind.

The federal government plays a role in all this through its funding of programs to share the risk of losses such as the National Flood Insurance Program and disaster relief efforts. It also provides access to climate data used by insurers to foresee potential risks and formulate rates.

The Trump administration’s policies on climate, cutting funding to key programs, reducing access to and limiting the collection of climate data, and slashing the ranks of federal regulators are contributing to an increase in property insurance rates for homeowners, said insurance industry analysts and experts.

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.

Asked about the Trump administration’s plans to help reduce property insurance rates, a White House spokesperson declined to speak on the record, but provided Capital & Main with a statement from an unnamed official:

“More people are living in Florida than ever before, which naturally causes an increase in rates,” the statement said. “It’s inaccurate and silly to pin this on climate change. The Administration is working to lower costs across all industries for Americans.”

Consumers likely to hear tariff costs

The steep tariffs on materials like lumber, steel and aluminum are raising construction and repair costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers through higher home insurance premiums. First, insurance coverage limits “may no longer provide enough protection as the cost of materials and labor needed to rebuild your home increases,” noted Wawanesa Insurance in a blogpost. “Second, repair costs following claims will be higher, potentially influencing future premium rates.”

The main insurance industry trade group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, has been actively lobbying against tariffs because of their impact on home insurance.

Cuts to disaster relief funding, resiliency programs

The administration has cut disaster relief funds at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are given to local governments and states following natural disasters. The money is used to repair or reconstruct homes and finance housing. Without those resources, communities devastated by such catastrophes won’t be able to rebuild homes and infrastructure in more resilient ways, “and these communities will pay higher insurance premiums as a result,” writes DeLong, the Consumer Federation advocacy associate, and Ethan Weiland, another CFA research associate.

In April the Federal Emergency Management Agency terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, which provided grants to states and communities to fund projects that reduce the risk of damage from flooding, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Ending the program “means terminating mitigation projects that would have saved lives, lowered the risk of property loss, and reduced homeowner, farm, and business property insurance premiums,” DeLong and Weiland noted.

Reduced access to critical climate data

In May, the administration stopped updating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database for weather and climate disasters that cause more than $1 billion in damage. The database has historically been used by insurance and reinsurance companies to assess risks and project future losses. The loss of that data is likely to lead to less accurate pricing, and cause insurers to hike rates in response to unquantified risk.

In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.

One of the reports, which was uploaded by the Consumer Federation of America, on rising homeowners insurance costs from 2018 to 2022, showed how this increase outpaced the rate of inflation and that policy nonrenewal rates were higher in areas with higher-than-expected losses from climate-related disasters.

“We need reliable, long datasets,” said Kieran Bhatia, head of climate and sustainability for North America at the global reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. “Without them, you basically are kind of putting your finger up to the wind a little bit about what is a realistic [extreme weather] event.”

Bhatia and other climate risk specialists expressed their concerns during a panel discussion during New York Climate Week in September.

“If you want to promote economic growth, the best way to do that is to have good information,” said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress. “Capitalism relies on good information to make an efficient economy and insurers are subject to that rule as well. But now no one has this essential climate information.”

Rollback of renewable energy initiatives

The administration’s rollback of renewable energy initiatives — such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All initiative — has directly impacted the underwriting market for clean energy projects. That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.

And President Donald Trump’s executive orders to block state and local climate change measures — such as those that seek to limit carbon emissions or require oil and gas companies to pay for climate damage — could escalate future litigation risk for insurers as climate change worsens.

“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.

Hindered federal climate risk regulation

Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.

By reducing federal oversight, the administration is downplaying climate-related financial risks. This leaves property and financial markets more exposed and increases the instability that can be caused by higher costs and limited insurance availability.

Approval of new fossil fuel projects

The administration’s strong push to increase oil and gas production, such as approving six new liquefied natural gas terminals along the Gulf Coast, will likely accelerate the pace of climate change and lead to higher insurance premiums, said Ethan Nuss, senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network.

“The Trump administration’s fast-tracking of dirty energy mega-projects — like the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG (CP2) methane export terminal — increases the risk exposure of both insurers and neighboring communities that will be stuck paying out larger claims and skyrocketing premiums or be forced out of their ‘uninsurable’ homes.”

Already, the economic laws of supply and demand are reacting to the data center boom, pressing prices upward in regions expected to see the largest data center growth.

Why is the data center boom a problem for the power grid?","The push to build artificial intelligence data centers is speeding up, with a new report estimating the tech industry will require 106 gigawatts of electricity by 2035. But the breakneck pace at which Big Tech wants to secure computing power is raising serious concerns over whether power companies and regional grid operators can provide enough electricity for spiking demand.

In a new forecast from BloombergNEF, industry analysts found a 36% increase in the amount of electricity needed for existing and planned data centers, compared with BloombergNEF’s April analysis. The research and analytics company said it added 150 data centers to its tracker, and more than a quarter of them are immense pieces of infrastructure, needing upwards of 500 megawatts of power to run.

As demand for power increases, it’s unclear whether supply can keep up. Generating more electricity requires major investments and time to build the physical infrastructure of power plants, solar arrays and batteries. Already, the economic laws of supply and demand are reacting to the data center boom, pressing prices upward in regions expected to see the largest data center growth.

How much electricity is 100 gigawatts?

A watt is an instantaneous measurement of how much electricity a device or data center needs in order to run, and how much power a power plant or solar panel can provide. As opposed to a quantity of electricity consumed over a certain time, a watt — and its multiples such as megawatts and gigawatts — is how much electricity is produced or consumed in a split second.

One gigawatt is 1,000 megawatts, which is 1,000 kilowatts and a kilowatt is 1,000 watts.

In 2025, data centers account for around 40 gigawatts of power already, so BloombergNEF’s estimates say more than 60 additional gigawatts will be needed in the next 10 years.

The regional power grid serving California has never exceeded a peak demand record of 52 gigawatts set in 2022. If BloombergNEF’s forecast holds true, in 2035, data centers will need roughly double the amount of power as California currently requires to keep the lights on and the air conditioning pumping on its hottest summer night.

The new data centers that clock in at 500 megawatts or more are large enough to consume the electric generating capacity of entire power plants.

Why is the data center boom a problem for the power grid?

BloombergNEF describes the forces creating an “inflection moment for U.S. grids: the desire to accommodate AI-driven load without undermining reliability or driving up power costs.”

Last month, the independent market monitor on America’s largest regional electric grid PJM, which stretches from data center hubs in Virginia to Chicago, warned federal regulators that data centers threaten reliability — increasing the risk of blackouts.

“PJM is currently proposing to allow the interconnection of large new data center loads that it cannot serve reliably and that will require load curtailments (black outs) of the data centers or of other customers at times,” the independent grid watchdog Monitoring Analytics, LLC wrote in a filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

Monitoring Analytics asked FERC to stop PJM from approving new data centers unless the grid operator can guarantee new facilities can be “served reliably as defined both by transmission and capacity adequacy.”

BloombergNEF’s forecast shows new data centers coming to the PJM grid by 2030 will exceed the electricity additions from new power plants or renewable energy estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In Texas, BloombergNEF warns that the grid run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas could be in trouble as soon as 2028.

The grid has reserve power, an extra capacity to generate electricity from batteries or power plants that is kept offline during normal operating conditions, but is used as needed during emergencies. BloombergNEF said the ERCOT reserve margin could “fall into risky territory after 2028, a sign that short-term growth can be absorbed, but longer-term supply will lag.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2161850999_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:03:56.470124

Governor Lamont said, “At a time when American consumers are already struggling with high costs, this action by the federal administration will hit consumers in the wallet, resulting in cars that are less fuel efficient and more trips to the gas station. Fuel economy standards have been supported on a bipartisan basis for decades because they’re a win-win for the consumer and for our air quality.”

Commissioner Dykes said, “Over the past 15 years, the federal fuel economy standards have saved the average household $630 to $840 each year. In addition to increasing expenses on gas, the roll back will have other harmful impacts, including increased air pollution. Connecticut already faces high levels of air pollution from cars and trucks, which contribute to negative health outcomes for people with respiratory illnesses, particularly those in sensitive groups, such as children and older adults.”

There are more than 2.7 million vehicles registered in Connecticut. Cars and trucks account for almost 70% of smog-forming emissions in Connecticut and almost 35% of its climate pollution. Air quality in Connecticut exceeded the federal health-based standards for ozone (smog) on 23 days in 2024 and 22 days in 2025. Individuals in sensitive groups, including children, older adults, and those with pre-existing health conditions who are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution are at an increased risk of developing respiratory symptoms and may experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Children and people with asthma or other lung disease are most at risk of experiencing these symptoms. People experiencing severe symptoms are more likely to miss work or school and seek medical treatment.

In 2024, the NHTSA stated that its improved fuel economy standards would reduce fuel costs by $23 billion with net benefits at about $35 billion for drivers.

As a result, the addition of advanced fission nuclear power can reduce the total number of new generating facilities, transmission interconnections, and land area otherwise required to meet Washington's decarbonization goals.”","(The Center Square) – As Washington state invests in the electrification of its public transportation fleet while preparing for a ban on privately owned new gasoline-powered vehicles in 2035, regional energy stakeholders are addressing the practical issues of having the transmission lines necessary to meet demand.

At the same time, the state Legislature may give nuclear energy a renewed focus as a recent study warns of a regional energy resource gap beginning in 2026.

Western Transmission Expansion Coalition, or WestTEC, is an effort to create a transmission study for the regional energy grid that includes Washington along with states like Oregon, California, Colorado, Montana and Utah.

According to Energy Strategies Principal Keegan Moyer, acting on behalf of WestTEC, the grid for those states will see peak demands to increase by approximately 30% by 2035, with the need for about 20 gigawatts of resources per year. WestTEC's 10-year study calls for over 12,200 miles of either significant upgrades or additions to it, with an estimate price tag of $56 billion.

However, Moyer told the Joint Committee on Energy Supply, Energy Conservation, and Energy Resilience at its Wednesday meeting that “transmission is not easy to build.”

“There’s kind of an underlying issue with all of those factors, which is transmission is sort of a common constraint underlying all of these challenges,” he said. “So this network of lines, wires, equipment that helps to deliver power to our homes and businesses from where it's made is really short on capacity.”

He added that without the additional infrastructure, “our modeling indicates that we've failed to meet those [federal] standards, which could compromise grid reliability.”

According to Moyer, one of every 8 miles of transmission lines called for in their 10-year plan are upgrades to existing right of ways; additionally, one out of every 8 miles of transmission is currently under construction.

The need for expanded transmission infrastructure coincides with increased demand cased in part by “policy-driven electric vehicle adoption” and “anticipated data center interconnection,” according to a recent Pacific Northwest Resource Adequacy study. The study warned of a resource gap starting next year, noting that “preferred resources such as wind, solar and batteries make only small contributions to meeting resource adequacy needs.”

The study also noted that “timely development of all resources is extremely challenging due to permitting and interconnection delays, federal policy headwinds, and cost pressures,” according to a presentation to the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.

In addition to the state’s electrification of the public and private transportation sector, the 2019 Clean Energy Transformation Act requires utilities to shift away from carbon emitting energy sources in favor of clean energy; the ultimate goal is for utilities to provide carbon-free energy by 2045.

The anticipated grid load growth, loss of reliable carbon emitting energy, and the inadequacy of some alternative energy sources could inspire state lawmakers to turn elsewhere to address those needs. House Bill 2090 pre-filed by Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco, and cosponsored by Democrat Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, would add advanced nuclear power to the state’s energy strategy. Nuclear energy is considered a “non-emitting” energy source under CETA.

The bill language notes that “advanced nuclear power technologies offer a particularly efficient pathway” to replacing carbon emitting energy sources “because nuclear generation operates at a significantly higher capacity factor than wind or solar resources, thereby producing substantially more clean, firm energy. As a result, the addition of advanced fission nuclear power can reduce the total number of new generating facilities, transmission interconnections, and land area otherwise required to meet Washington's decarbonization goals.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e47550d8-b866-11ed-a481-ffd95f72d957.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-04 17:03:10.634211

About ARPA-E The UC Davis project is part of a $25 million investment to develop technologies that recover previously discarded critical minerals from U.S. wastewaters.","A new federally funded research project at the University of California, Davis, endeavors to extract valuable components for magnets, lasers and other modern technologies from an unlikely source: acidic wastewater from mines and industrial processes.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA‑E) awarded UC Davis researchers a $3 million grant to develop a bio‑based process that selectively captures rare earth elements from acidic mine‑influenced and industrial wastewater streams. The project is led by Yi Wang, an assistant professor in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering.

Rare earth elements are essential for high‑efficiency permanent magnets in electric vehicles, wind turbines and advanced electronics. Yet, conventional extraction and separation methods are chemically intensive and generate significant waste. The UC Davis‑led team aims to transform this by engineering acid‑tolerant microbes to produce metal‑binding proteins that work directly at low pH, enabling low-cost onsite recovery.

“This technology aims to turn a liability into a resource,” said Wang. “By selectively capturing rare earths where acidic wastewater is generated — like acid mine drainage and tailings liquors — we can reduce chemical use and waste while strengthening a resilient domestic supply chain for clean‑energy manufacturing.”

The project aims to use artificial intelligence for protein design, structural characterization and acid‑compatible process development. Engineered biocatalysts, deployed in acid-tolerant microbial hosts, will selectively capture rare earth elements from acidic wastewaters, delivering a simpler, cleaner route from dilute waste streams to valuable materials.

Molecular precision

“Our AI‑guided protein design lets us tune the protein binding loops to remain fast and highly selective even at very low pH,” said Justin Siegel, co‑principal investigator and professor in the Department of Chemistry. “That molecular precision — coupled with acid-tolerant microbes — enables a shorter, greener recovery train with fewer unit operations.”

The UC Davis‑led ARPA‑E project hopes to demonstrate selective, low‑pH recovery and onsite concentration of critical rare earth elements from difficult wastewaters — reducing chemicals and energy, shrinking waste, and tapping large domestic inventories that are currently discarded.

In addition to the core science, the project includes a dedicated tech‑to‑market effort to chart a path from lab discovery to real‑world deployment. “Our job is to make sure this doesn’t stay just a great idea on paper,” said Boon‑Ling Yeo, co‑principal investigator and lead for the tech‑to‑market task at UC Davis. “We’re evaluating costs, markets and potential partners so that recovering rare earths from wastewater is not only technically feasible, but also economically attractive for utilities, mining operators and manufacturers across the United States.”

Besides UC Davis investigators, the project collaborators include Libin Ye from the University of South Florida, and Ning Sun and Chang Dou from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

The Proposal Development Services team within the Office of Research played an instrumental role to help create a successful proposal for the ARPA-E award. The team offers extensive services and resources to assist in the development and submission of extramural funding proposals.

About ARPA-E

The UC Davis project is part of a $25 million investment to develop technologies that recover previously discarded critical minerals from U.S. wastewaters. As part of a critical minerals and materials funding initiative announced by the Department of Energy earlier this year, the Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters (RECOVER) program aims to reduce American dependence on critical mineral imports by establishing new, secure, domestic supply chains.

Under the FY25 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the State Department was required to report on ways to promote internet freedom in Iran. That report was submitted, but it did not fully evaluate new direct-to-cell satellite technology, an emerging tool that could allow smartphones to connect directly to satellites and bypass the Iranian regime’s censorship and government-controlled networks. Internet shutdowns, surveillance, and digital repression are among the regime’s most powerful tools to silence dissent, making it essential for the U.S. to examine every possible option to help Iranians access secure, uncensored communication. The FREEDOM Act ensures the State Department, the FCC, and the Treasury conduct a full feasibility review of these technologies, so Congress has the information needed to stay ahead of authoritarian tactics and support basic freedoms abroad.

Smaller nuclear reactors spark renewed interest in a once-shunned energy source USC already has a head start.","COLUMBIA — State utility executives, legislators and the lead investor in the reboot of South Carolina’s abandoned nuclear reactors will tell the story behind the multibillion-dollar deal during a nuclear-focused conference in Columbia next week.

The state’s second annual nuclear summit will feature a panel conversation with Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton, president of the utility’s governing board Peter McCoy, House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, and state Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort.

Separately, attendees will hear from the executives of Brookfield Asset Management, the New York investment firm in negotiations with Santee Cooper for the purchase of two partially built reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear station in Fairfield County.

The event is something of a celebration of actions taken over the past year and a half, according to Ethel Bunch, the founder of a nuclear advocacy group — the Palmetto Nuclear Coalition — made up of large energy-using companies and nuclear-related firms that is co-hosting the conference alongside the University of South Carolina.

After all, it was during the state’s inaugural nuclear summit in August 2024 that Davis, one of the project’s most vocal cheerleader in the Legislature, publicly broached the idea of a V.C. Summer restart.

“He came out on the stage after the breakout sessions and said, ‘We’re all talking around this opportunity. We need to talk about this opportunity,’” Bunch said.

Those remarks set into motion a chain of events: a scouting trip by a state advisory group to see the condition of the unfinished reactors, Santee Cooper putting them on the market, Gov. Henry McMaster’s calls for a “nuclear renaissance,” legislation supporting the effort, and now a pending deal for the sale.

A nuclear history

Whispers about rebooting V.C. Summer’s expansion had begun a year earlier, Bunch said, as tech giants and major manufacturers looked for sources of low-to-no carbon power. Nuclear became the answer.

South Carolina’s four nuclear power plants already supply 55% of the state’s total electricity and the state is the third-largest producer of nuclear power in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The state also is home to nuclear fuel-maker Westinghouse’s U.S. facility. And the Savannah River Site, which once produced weapons-grade plutonium and tritium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal during the decades-long Cold War, now recycles the radioactive materials for reuse.

SC’s state utility enters negotiations on deal to restart failed nuclear project

Now state leaders want to double-down and make South Carolina a nuclear stronghold.

The V.C. Summer expansion, fraught with fraud and cost overruns, continues to be a black mark on the state that has left power customers footing the bill for the reactors that have never produced a megawatt.

But in the past year, restarting construction has gone from a far-fetched idea to one politicians and industry executives are championing.

At the conference Tuesday, Santee Cooper leadership is expected to talk in depth about the closed-door meetings where the decisions were made.

Executives from Brookfield will then take the stage to talk about their interest in the South Carolina power plant and other national trends. Brookfield now also owns Westinghouse, the company that designed the V.C. Summer reactors, having bought it when the nuclear debacle sent it spiraling into bankruptcy.

What’s next

In October, Brookfield, its subsidiary Westinghouse and Canada-based Cameco inked a partnership deal valued at $80 billion, with the U.S. government. The companies will build 10 reactors identical to those at V.C. Summer.

Under the agreement, the federal government will help secure financing and permits for the reactors. In return, the government could take a 20% share of any profits after Brookfield and Cameco take a $17.5 billion share.

If Westinghouse’s value surpasses $30 billion by 2029, the government could turn those profits into a 20% equity stake in the company.

Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

South Carolina’s reactors would be the first and second on the list, with construction starting by 2030.

“When you’re an engineer, all problems become opportunities,” said Hossein Haj-Hariri, the dean of USC’s engineering and computing school. “V.C. Summer was a major egg on the face of the state. But we have (the reactors.) They’re sitting there. They are partly done.”

The project still has a long way to go, Haj-Hariri acknowledges, but USC also wants to be part of the solution.

The state’s largest university system is offering up its technological expertise.

“The thing that has made nuclear struggle is not the design of the reactor. It’s how do you put it together so that you come in on time and on budget?” Haj-Hariri said.

His suggestions: use modern tools, such as artificial intelligence and sensors, to gather data and learn as you build; make use of new, more advanced building materials; and use drones to manage the construction site.

“We are going to develop construction engineering with a focus on nuclear so that we can help the eventual builder of V.C. Summer,” Haj-Hariri said. “We are not just building two reactors. We are building the infrastructure that helps build future reactors. We come up with processes.”

To ensure the plans will work, USC has the technology to create virtual simulations to test them out before building begins, something the school has been doing for years at its McNair Aerospace Center, alongside Columbia-based Integer Technologies, on contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Other opportunities

In addition to the Trump administration’s push for 10 new, large-scale reactors, Haj-Hariri sees opportunity in another of the president’s executive orders.

That order calls for small-scale, micro reactors at nine U.S. Army bases by 2028: Fort Benning in Georgia, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Campbell in Kentucky, Fort Drum in New York, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Wainwright in Alaska, Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee, Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, and Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.

Smaller nuclear reactors spark renewed interest in a once-shunned energy source

USC already has a head start. The college has worked on micro reactor projects in the past, Haj-Hariri said.

The Army previously explored them as a way to replace the need for diesel generators used to power battlefield outposts for deployed troops. The school also was developing mini reactors for fueling naval ships until the Trump administration defunded the project in its DOGE-led purge of clean energy grants, Haj-Hariri said.

USC hopes to channel this momentum around nuclear into a new innovation center planned for the south end of campus. The five-story building would house reactor-related research on three floors while renting out the remaining space to industry partners.

And more nuclear in the state could spell more jobs of USC engineering graduates.

Of the 1,700 South Carolina college students who graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, only 54% were working in the state a year after graduation, according to data from the state employment agency.

“It’s not because our graduates don’t want to stay here,” he said. “But if there are no jobs, then where do they go? They go to North Carolina, Georgia, somewhere else.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Advanced_Nuclear_Summit_2024-137.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 16:02:46.346178

While upfront vehicle prices drop an estimated $930, Americans will spend up to $185 billion more on fuel over the coming decades.
Trump’s reversal extends beyond fuel economy.
He’s rescinded EV tax credits, blocked California from banning gas vehicle sales after 2035, and signed legislation ending fuel economy penalties for automakers.
One claim from Trump Wednesday didn’t match reality: he said vehicle prices were declining, but September data shows new vehicle prices up 0.8% year-over-year.","President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping changes to America’s fuel economy regulations on Wednesday, slashing efficiency targets that would force drivers to burn 100 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 while handing automakers a $35 billion windfall.

Key Takeaways:

Fuel economy requirements drop from 50.4 mpg to 34.5 mpg by 2031, reducing vehicle costs by $930 but increasing lifetime fuel expenses significantly

Automakers save billions—GM gets $8.7 billion, Ford and Stellantis each receive over $5 billion in compliance relief

Credit trading between manufacturers ends in 2028, potentially devastating Tesla and Rivian’s revenue from selling emissions credits

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s proposal reverses course on Biden-era climate initiatives, cutting requirements for model years 2022 through 2031. Instead of Biden’s aggressive 8-10% annual efficiency increases, Trump’s plan calls for modest 0.25-0.5% yearly improvements.

“People want the gasoline car,” Trump declared at the White House, flanked by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis leadership. Farley characterized the rollback as “a victory for common sense and affordability,” promising investments in cheaper vehicles.

The numbers tell a different story for consumers. While upfront vehicle prices drop an estimated $930, Americans will spend up to $185 billion more on fuel over the coming decades. Carbon dioxide emissions climb 5%, equivalent to adding 7.7 million vehicles to the roads annually by 2035.

Environmental groups attacked the proposal immediately. Kathy Harris from the Natural Resources Defense Council said drivers would pay “hundreds of dollars more at the pump every year” to benefit oil companies. California Governor Gavin Newsom accused Trump of “poisoning the air in our communities.”

The plan eliminates credit trading between automakers in 2028—a system NHTSA now calls a “windfall for EV-exclusive manufacturers.” Tesla and Rivian have generated substantial revenue selling these credits to traditional automakers struggling with compliance. That income stream disappears under Trump’s framework.

GM CEO Mary Barra defended the changes Tuesday, revealing the company faced potential plant closures under California’s previous zero-emission vehicle mandates. Before Congress blocked those state rules in June, manufacturers confronted requirements that 35% of 2026 vehicles be electric.

“We were going to have to start shutting down plants because we weren’t going to be able to build and sell those vehicles,” Barra explained.

Biden’s original 2022 standards would have reduced gasoline consumption by 200 billion gallons through 2050, cutting 659 million metric tons of emissions. The administration projected $35.2 billion in net benefits for drivers through reduced fuel costs.

Trump’s reversal extends beyond fuel economy. He’s rescinded EV tax credits, blocked California from banning gas vehicle sales after 2035, and signed legislation ending fuel economy penalties for automakers. No manufacturer faces fines dating back to 2022 model year vehicles.

Transportation generates the largest share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Trump’s proposal doesn’t eliminate gasoline vehicles—Biden’s rules never required that—but it removes incentives for automakers to accelerate electric vehicle production.

The proposal now enters a public comment period before final implementation. Trump emphasized consumer choice, though critics argue the real winners are automakers and oil companies, not drivers facing higher pump prices.

One claim from Trump Wednesday didn’t match reality: he said vehicle prices were declining, but September data shows new vehicle prices up 0.8% year-over-year. Kelley Blue Book reported in October that average new car prices crossed $50,000 for the first time, climbing 3.6% annually.

The rule revision reduces past-year requirements retroactively, making compliance dramatically easier for a period still under NHTSA review. This administrative maneuver delivers immediate financial relief to Detroit’s Big Three and other manufacturers.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dawn-mcdonald-TIZmsrOw7vc-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:03:47.004691

As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands.","Conservation groups in Montana and across the West are raising concerns about Steve Pearce, a former New Mexico representative who is President Donald Trump’s newest nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management.

The nomination has reignited a fight over the management of public lands which was highlighted during negotiations over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” due to proposed amendments to sell off federal land. The fight also spawned two new bipartisan caucuses in Congress, both co-chaired by Montanans, and predicated on public land access and management.

In Montana and the two Dakotas, the BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups.

According to the Center for Western Priorities, Pearce amassed a “lengthy anti-public lands record,” sponsoring bills to shrink national monuments and increase extraction on national forest land.

Many conservation groups are specifically honing in on Pearce’s long record of advocating to sell off federal lands, including sponsoring legislation in Congress to authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments.

In a letter to then-House Speaker John Boehner in 2012, Pearce wrote that of the federal lands located in the West, “most of it we do not even need.”

He proposed using land sales to reduce the deficit, similar to rhetoric heard earlier when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum equated federal lands to the nation’s “balance sheet.”

“We cannot afford to hand the keys to 245 million acres of our public lands over to someone who has spent his career trying to auction them off to the highest bidder,” Aubrey Bertram, staff attorney and federal policy director at Wild Montana, said. “Steve Pearce’s record is crystal clear: he believes public lands should be privatized for billionaires’ benefit, not protected for the people’s.”

But Pearce’s nomination has been greeted with enthusiasm by mining and energy companies that operate on federal land, as well as by many Republican officials, including Montana Sen. Steve Daines.

“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”

Daines is a member of the newly formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, which is co-chaired by Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy.

The two Montanans also bucked their party earlier this year by joining Senate Democrats in a resolution that would have prevented the use of public land sales to reduce the deficit.

Representatives for Daines and Sheehy did not respond to questions about Pearce’s nomination.

Sheehy has not publicly stated whether he will support Pearce.

But Montana’s federal delegation has been supportive of increasing coal and energy extraction in the state.

In eastern Montana, Congress recently voted to overturn a Biden-era restriction on resource extraction on federal land, reopening nearly 1.7 million acres to future coal leasing.

All members of the state’s delegation supported the move calling it vital to the state’s economy and the nation’s energy security.

Pearce has roots in the oil and gas industry that stretch beyond his political work.

In the 1980s, Pearce founded an oilfield services company in New Mexico, which he later sold when he won his first election.

Starting in 2003, he represented New Mexico in Congress for seven terms.

He lost races for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and governor in 2018.

While conservation and public land advocates have pushed back against Pearce’s nomination, industry groups have applauded Trump’s pick.

The National Cattleman’s Beef Association said Pearce’s experience makes him “thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing.”

The Western Energy Alliance, comprising oil and gas companies across nine western states, also put out a statement of support for Pearce.

“As a westerner coming from a state that’s nearly 20 percent BLM land, he understands the bureau’s mission. As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands. Steve has been a longtime friend who understands the value of energy development among other uses,” the Alliance said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BLM-office-I-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 17:02:23.165545

The policy shift, revealed at a White House event attended by Detroit’s major automakers, significantly reduces the pressure to accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The announcement represents a major strategic win for Stellantis, whose U.S. sales success depends heavily on popular — and fuel-consuming — trucks, SUVs, and muscle cars.

A Regulatory Reset Favoring Stellantis’ Core Products –

Under the Biden administration, fuel-economy rules were designed to push the national fleet toward an average of more than 50 mpg by 2031, which would have required aggressive electrification across vehicle lineups. Trump’s new proposal drops that requirement to 34.5 mpg — a number more compatible with current consumer behavior.

This shift aligns far better with Stellantis’ internal planning. Brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep®, and Ram rely heavily on traditional gasoline vehicles with higher performance, towing capability, and size — characteristics that generally work against strict mileage mandates.

Filosa: A “Great Day” for Stellantis Customers –

CEO Antonio Filosa spoke directly to how the revised standards support demand-driven manufacturing rather than forced transitions. Standing alongside Trump, he told the audience:

“It’s a great day for us at Stellantis today, because it’s a day where we see CAFE regulation reconciled with real customers’ demand.”

That statement encapsulates Stellantis’ position: consumers — not federal regulators — should shape the powertrain mix sold in U.S. showrooms.

Ford CEO Jim Farley echoed that sentiment, adding:

“Today is a victory for common sense and affordability. We believe that people should be able to make a choice, as you said, Mr. President, and we will invest more in affordable vehicles.”

While Farley’s quote supports the broader industry consensus, Stellantis was noticeably more enthusiastic about the rollback’s immediate benefits to its U.S. portfolio.

Policy Instability Remains a Concern –

Even as Stellantis celebrates this regulatory shift, industry experts warn that America’s automotive rules continue to swing dramatically from administration to administration. Long-term product planning—typically spanning 8 to 12 years—becomes more complicated, costlier, and riskier when rules change every 4 years.

For the moment, Stellantis enjoys a rare alignment between government policy and its strongest market offerings. Yet the company must still prepare for the possibility of another rapid reversal depending on future election outcomes.

The rollback of fuel-efficiency rules marks a pivotal moment for Stellantis and the Mopar brands it leads. With fewer constraints pushing immediate electrification, the company can continue investing in the vehicles that define its U.S. identity: big trucks, capable SUVs, and performance-driven muscle cars.

Nuclear power is particularly sensitive to the cost of capital due to long construction periods and high upfront costs relative to later operational expenses.
For countries serious about universal energy access and climate commitments, nuclear power deserves a prominent place in the conversation.","Countries across the emerging and developing world face a defining challenge: how to expand energy access, power economic growth, and meet climate targets all at once. Nuclear power was once seen as a cornerstone of clean energy expansion, but as projects in high-income countries ran into major cost overruns and long construction timelines, it slipped off the development agenda.

Our analysis of eight emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) — Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Rwanda, and South Africa — shows that integrating nuclear power into clean energy transitions can reduce total system costs by 2-31% compared to renewable-only pathways.

Nuclear as a Complement, Not a Competitor

The modelling reveals an important insight: nuclear and renewables work better together than either does alone. Across all scenarios where nuclear deployment was permitted, nuclear power accounted for 10-30% of generation by 2050 in cost-optimal pathways, while solar and wind continued to dominate the overall generation mix.

This complementarity stems from how different technologies meet different system needs. Solar provides cheap daytime power; wind adds variability and geographic diversity; and nuclear offers firm, dispatchable generation that reduces storage requirements and smooths daily dispatch patterns. We considered other baseload technologies like geothermal and hydropower, and found that nuclear works especially well in areas where these two are not geographically or geologically feasible. Together, they create more resilient systems than any single technology could provide.

When Ambition Scales, Nuclear's Value Grows Even More

The main analysis assumes countries reach at least a “Modern Energy Minimum” of 1,000 kilowatt-hours per person per year by 2050. But what happens when countries pursue genuine energy abundance to power large-scale industrialization?

A case study of Ghana illustrates nuclear’s role when ambitions scale dramatically. Rather than modest growth to the minimum threshold, this scenario models Ghana reaching 3,500 kWh per capita by 2050, which is comparable to India’s projected demand.

To meet this fourfold increase in demand with renewables alone, Ghana would need to build more than 300 gigawatts of generation capacity, 40 GW of storage, and 50 GW of transmission by 2050. The nuclear pathway delivers the same power requirements with a far smaller system: roughly 60 GW of generation, 10 GW of storage, and 30 GW of transmission.

Benefits Beyond the Balance Sheet

Lower electricity costs matter enormously for development, but nuclear energy offers additional advantages that modelling alone cannot fully capture.

Nuclear plants create more numerous, higher-paid, and longer-lasting jobs than other clean energy technologies, with roughly half of coal plant jobs directly transferable to nuclear facilities. For countries like South Africa looking to transition away from coal, this represents a genuine pathway to a just transition that doesn’t abandon workers.

The Path Forward Isn't Without Obstacles

If nuclear power offers such clear benefits, why hasn’t deployment accelerated in EMDEs? The barriers are substantial and varied.

Expert interviews identified three critical challenges: government capacity and effectiveness, public engagement and acceptance, and nuclear project financing.

Nuclear power is particularly sensitive to the cost of capital due to long construction periods and high upfront costs relative to later operational expenses.

Yet recent experience shows these barriers can be overcome. Since 2000, eight countries have started to build or successfully built their first nuclear plants, with the UAE achieving 23% nuclear generation after 16 years. Each selected proven reactor designs, secured international partnerships for financing and expertise, and built government-led programs with sustained political support.

A Role for Catalytic Support

The most effective nuclear deployments will require support beyond what market forces or national governments can provide alone. This is where international cooperation and strategic philanthropy can play catalytic roles.

The need is urgent. While nuclear energy accounts for 20% of global clean electricity generation, it receives less than 0.2% of climate philanthropy, which is a striking imbalance given nuclear’s proven role in decarbonization.

Time to Act

The modelling makes clear that the cost savings from nuclear energy emerge primarily in the final phase of decarbonization (after 2040 in most modelled countries). But construction timelines mean that planning and building must begin decades earlier, well before market signals alone would trigger investment.

Countries don’t need to choose between economic growth and climate action, or between energy access and environmental protection. With the right technology mix, supportive policies, and strategic investment, emerging economies can achieve energy abundance while building cleaner, more resilient power systems.

The window for action is now. Every year of delay makes the final phase of decarbonization more expensive and more difficult. For countries serious about universal energy access and climate commitments, nuclear power deserves a prominent place in the conversation.

The United States added 2 GW of utility-scale solar to the grid in September, bringing total solar installed this year to 21 GW — slightly above the 20 GW installed over the same period last year, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s latest monthly infrastructure update.

Solar accounted for 75% of the 28 GW of new generation installed in 2025 so far, followed by wind at 13% and gas at 11%.

Natural gas is still the largest single generation resource in the U.S. electric power system, comprising 42% of total installed generating capacity. Wind, solar and hydro together make up 31% of the capacity mix.

Dive Insight:

The results of FERC’s latest infrastructure report show that solar continues to dominate new generation coming online as the country experiences rising demand for the first time in about two decades. The report does not include energy storage or rooftop solar.

Enverus Intelligence Research recently released its long-term U.S. power capacity expansion outlook, which projected a 57% increase in installed capacity by 2050 driven largely by solar and nuclear.

EIR analysts said they expect solar additions to peak in 2028, “but remain competitive, supported by ongoing demand for power purchase agreements (PPAs) and low costs.”

“Our analysis shows the U.S. grid is entering a transformative period, with solar installations surging in the near term and nuclear power taking a leading role in the decades ahead,” Juan Arteaga, principal analyst at EIR, said in a statement.

EIR’s relatively positive outlook for solar comes despite attacks on renewable energy by the Trump administration, whose officials have derided solar and wind as unreliable and expensive. In July, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act sunsetting renewable energy tax credits early, and his administration has also sought to revoke permits for some renewable energy projects and subject others to additional scrutiny that has slowed deployment.

But the administration’s preferred alternatives — nuclear, gas and coal — face myriad obstacles to replacing solar as the dominant new generation source.

The EIR report said nuclear will not achieve steady expansion until around 2040, while gas will continue to displace coal, which it expects to be fully phased out around the same time.

Texas offers $3.2M in reforestation funding

The Texas Resilient Landscapes Initiative is offering $3.2 million in cost-share funding over the next four years, the forest service announced Monday.

They intend on using the funds to reimburse landowners for their work to help repair land in areas at risk of environmental change and disasters.

Applications to take part in the initiative are already open, and they close on Jan. 23, 2026.

What they're saying:

""Forested and riparian ecosystems across Texas are increasingly threatened by natural disasters and weather extremes,"" said Erin Davis, Texas A&M Forest Service Program Coordinator. ""This cost-share initiative will help landowners replant their properties with native woodland species to establish a more resilient and sustainable forest for the future.""

""Reforestation is an essential part of sustaining the next generation of trees in our forests and woodlands,"" said Davis. ""Our hope is to support the restoration of natural landscapes across the state by providing funding to landowners who may have lost trees to natural causes such as fire, flood, disease and drought.""

How to claim up to $80,000

What you can do:

The initiative is only open to non-federal, non-industrial forest landowners, including tribal and local governments.

Ted Yackulic worked for the EPA for more than 35 years and focused on ensuring polluters paid for environmental cleanup. He would help write orders and negotiate agreements to clean up some of the Northwest’s most polluted places.

This summer, he and more than 150 of his colleagues across the U.S. signed a letter advocating for the agency to continue its mission and condemning EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s efforts to dismantle human health and environmental protections and slash the agency’s scientific research and environmental justice programs.

Yackulic and 145 other EPA employees who signed the letter were reportedly placed on administrative leave in July. Nine probationary employees were fired on the spot, and another nine were fired after receiving notices of proposed removal, including Yackulic, according to the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, the EPA’s largest union.

On Wednesday, Yackulic and five other former employees filed legal challenges to their firings with the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board. They argue their firings are illegal retaliation for perceived political affiliation.

These are people who exercised their First Amendment right by raising an issue of public concern outside of their official capacities, said Joanna Citron Day, one of the attorneys representing the fired EPA employees and general counsel for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

When asked for comment about Yackulic’s challenge, an EPA spokesperson wrote Wednesday evening, “As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation.”

The former employees also argue their firings were arbitrarily harsh and inconsistent punishment for their actions compared to other signatories of the letter and that they were fired without cause.

Yackulic said he witnessed the ebb and flow of presidential administrations’ contrasting priorities. He said he’d always been able to work within those boundaries and keep the pace of what he’s working on.

Yackulic said that at the time of signing the letter, the administrator had announced intentions to change the direction of the agency.

The EPA has fundamentally changed this year by rolling back cornerstone environmental policies that protect clean water and air.

It has also proposed to remove federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands and streams. It plans to stop acknowledging that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health. And the administration continues to undo limits on toxic chemicals in drinking water, fossil fuel emissions, among other human health protections.

Earth saw its warmest year on record in 2024. Climate change is fueling drought, record deadly heat, more wildfire and longer fire seasons in the Pacific Northwest.

Rising ocean temperatures fueled by human-caused climate change have intensified hurricanes in the Atlantic, low-oxygen conditions off the Pacific Northwest coast are becoming more frequent and ocean acidification threatens the food web, fisheries and the people who depend on them.

A long career

Yackulic was born in Colville, Stevens County, grew up in Bellevue and never strayed far from the Northwest.

Scrambling along Index Town Wall and hiking across the Enchantments, a young Yackulic developed a reverence for the wild, and an appreciation for a green world.

He attended Seattle University and law school in California and met his wife Corrie while studying for the bar exam at the University of Washington. He hoped to leave the world he had experienced as a child in at least as good of shape as it was for generations to come.

After law school, Yackulic began to see glaciers recede and other signs of a changing climate.

On his first day at the EPA in 1989, he was assigned to work on the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex Superfund Site. After decades of smelter emissions and dumping mine waste into rivers and streams, the area in Idaho’s panhandle was one of the largest and most complex cleanups in the nation.

Many children in the community at the time had high blood lead levels, an epidemic.

Over time, the result of work by the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, state of Idaho, local public health officials, Yackulic and his colleagues at the EPA to address the heavy metal contamination was tangible.

Diagrams showed steep declines in blood lead levels in tandem with cleanup efforts: when the smelter stopped emitting, when contaminated soil was removed from residents’ yards and the site itself. Fish and wildlife began to recover.

Over the decades, he worked with King County and the city of Seattle to ensure their sewage management was compliant with the Clean Water Act, worked alongside tribal nations to recognize their authority to implement federal environmental laws within their lands, and advanced Superfund cleanups through orders and negotiating settlements.

Simply put, his role over the years was to ensure the fundamental principle of the nation’s Superfund law: The polluter pays for the cleanup.

Now 68, Yackulic hadn’t tied his retirement to a specific age, or an amount hitting his savings, but rather to seeing some of his cases through.

In particular, he wanted to see a consent decree entered on the lower Duwamish and then, he said, stick around for maybe a few more construction seasons to see how the work progresses.

Last year, he drafted an order so Boeing, the city of Seattle and King County could begin in-water cleanup on the lower Duwamish before a court-approved settlement was reached. He and his colleague Nick Vidargas didn’t want to see the pace of the cleanup slowed down.

Yackulic had begun mentoring another attorney who would take over the Quendall site along Lake Washington.

It was another site he had hoped to see through, but both he and the probationary attorney he was working with were fired for signing the letter.

“Stand up for science”

EPA Administrator Zeldin promised weeks into his tenure to drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

The Trump administration in February began firing probationary employees across the federal government.

Zeldin would order the closure of the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights and cut millions of dollars destined for communities bearing the brunt of the impacts polluting industries and climate change.

Yackulic would open his federal inbox and find regular newsblasts from Zeldin, a newsletter dubbed “Call it a Comeback.”

In March, the newsletter announced “the greatest day of deregulation in American history,” including reconsidering the Endangerment Finding, which provided a legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and plans to limit the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act.

An early June newsblast highlighted proposals to protect “Beautiful, Clean Coal.”

Others celebrated efforts to slash EPA jobs and block policies to encourage the use of electric vehicles.

Yackulic continued with his work.

When he became aware of the EPA employees’ public letter, organized by the “Stand Up for Science” activists, he saw many of his colleagues had already signed on. It was an opportunity to ask the agency to reaffirm its commitment to its mandate, so he signed.

On July 3 he was asked to leave. He spent a few hours collecting the decades of work at his desk and left the office.

“It was heartbreaking. I was shocked,” he said. “I worked with incredible people, and we did good work.”

Concerns foreshadowed in the letter were becoming a reality, Yackulic said.

Just before Labor Day, he would receive a notice of proposed removal on a charge of “Conduct Unbecoming a Federal Employee,” because he had admitted to signing the “Declaration of Dissent.”

In response, Yackulic wrote that signing the letter “is protected First Amendment speech under applicable caselaw,” but was fired Oct. 4.

Decisions about the firings can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12032025_tzr_tzr_163248.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-04 16:02:23.431471

They also expressed frustration and distrust with DTE Energy. The utility is asking the state for expedited approval of the company’s contracts with Oracle Corp. for a data center planned in Saline Township, near Ann Arbor.

The facility would require 1.4 gigawatts of power from the electricity provider. The data center is part of Stargate, OpenAI’s $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure around the United States.

DTE Electric has asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast-track approval for its plan with Oracle to power the data center. That would bypass a process called a “contested case” that requires the commission to consider evidence and testimony from a variety of sources. Michigan’s Attorney General expressed alarm about the process, calling the hearing “performative listening” in a rebuke last month.

Protest

A small group of protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon across the street from DTE Energy’s Detroit headquarters. They were unhappy that DTE has tried to push plans for the data center through without public hearing.

Sarah Brabbs is from York Township, next to Saline. While she is not totally opposed to a data center, she said she’s not a fan of DTE trying to push the project through without allowing the public in on the process.

“Putting rate payers in a situation that you know we will be paying for, probably on multiple levels, is disingenuous, dysfunctional, and unacceptable,” Brabbs said.

Others at the protest said they’re concerned about the potential environmental impact, like how much water the facility could use and the amount of energy it would need to function.

“The access to the Great Lakes, they’re definitely taking advantage of whatever God-given resource in order to just implement whatever quantum, whatever new level of science and technology that they haven’t got consent from the people on if they even want it in the first place,” said Elijah Williams.

A virtual hearing Wednesday evening drew almost 90 participants. About 45 people spoke over the two and a half hours, with more in queue when the meeting ended at 9 p.m.

Appealing to Michigan’s workforce

A few speakers voiced support for the project. Most of the supporters represented trade unions or business associations who supported the project for creating jobs.

Randall Whitaker is the president of the Washtenaw County Skilled Building Trades Council. He said the project was an investment in Michigan’s workforce.

“A project like this is huge for workers,” he said.

Constructing the data center would create about 2,500 union jobs, according to DTE’s application. Other supporters argued that the facility would generate millions in tax revenue and attract talent to Michigan.

Burdening the electric grid?

DTE has said it expects the facility to increase its current peak electrical load by about 25%, but building out the capacity to accommodate that demand would not affect current ratepayers. DTE argues in its application that the data center won’t impact existing customers’ rates because of safeguards they’ve placed in the contracts with Oracle.

“The project strengthens Michigan’s long-term competitiveness in the fast-growing AI and advanced computing sectors, helping ensure our state remains a destination for innovation and talent,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement supporting the project.

But most participants opposed DTE’s request, citing the same concerns as the protesters – future electricity costs, how much water the facility would use, and whether the data center would actually benefit the local community.

A lack of transparency

Nichole Biber is a member of the Little Traverse Band of Odawa Indians, one of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan. She said she doesn’t trust DTE or Oracle to do what’s best for residents.

“These ‘meaningful guardrails,’ from what I’ve heard so far, are all on the assurances of DTE and the multibillion dollar corporations that are pushing AI and data centers on us,” she said. “That does not reassure me.”

DTE’s application, which includes the contracts with Oracle, is partially redacted.

Maggie Kaercher, who runs a small fish farm in Dexter and also attended the hearing, said she wants the commission to deny DTE’s request and have the application available for a more thorough review.

“You can’t pretend that there’s transparency when there is so much redacted out of the papers that we’ve been able to see,” she said.

“What we are asking, and what many other people are asking for as well, is that the Commission give DTE’s proposal the proper scrutiny and ensure transparency,” said Katie Duckworth, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center. “Because this is the largest data center to be proposed in Michigan, and it’s one of the largest in the nation.”

Renewable energy or more fossil fuels?

Duckworth said the organization is concerned with how the data center’s power load will impact DTE’s ability to comply with Michigan’s climate change plans.

“It would also significantly increase the company’s renewable energy obligation under Michigan’s clean energy laws,” she said.

DTE is prepared for that challenge, the company said.

“Bringing on a data center of this size means more renewables, and more battery storage,” DTE said in a statement. The company also said the data center’s operators will finance the energy generation and storage needed to run the facility.

Duckworth said that solution would be “transformational” for DTE’s grid – if it happens.

“It raises a lot of questions including as to how those batteries would be charged and whether they will be charged by renewable energy, or whether it would involve prolonging the life of polluting fossil fuel plants or even building additional fossil fuel plants in the future,” she said.

Oracle expects the facility to open in December 2026. It won’t reach its maximum capacity of 1.4 gigawatts until December 2027, according to DTE’s application to the commission.

In October, DTE asked the commission to issue a decision by Friday, December 5. The commission is meeting at 1 p.m. that day.

At the virtual hearing, commissioners encouraged members of the public to attend a hearing on December 18 about the facility’s wetland impact permit, hosted by the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

‘People want the gasoline car’

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats’ efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,” said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. “We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-12-04 19:07:37+00:00,www.ajot.com,"Washington – Caracas: Crude words, heavy barrels—Rystad Energy oil market note",Not Available,,,,,https://www.ajot.com/news/washington-caracas-crude-words-heavy-barrels-rystad-energy-oil-market-note,"Dubai crude oil price premiums to ICE Brent will likely increase if Venezuelan supply is lost even in part.
This will drive global heavy crude oil discounts to lighter grades to narrow until Venezuelan supply is re-established.
In 2024, Venezuela produced 975,000 bpd of crude oil, of which 657,000 bpd was heavy.
Venezuela’s production was approximately 1% of global supply but 4.5% of global heavy crude oil supply in 2024.
US Gulf Coast refineries are configured to process heavy crude oil for up to 30% of their slate, with some in the region capable of running in excess of 75% heavy oil.","Benchmark crude oil prices could be impacted significantly by escalating military tensions between the US and Venezuela, with the Trump administration tightening pressure on Nicolas Maduros’ regime and signaling the possibility of a US incursion.

Venezuela currently produces 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, placing this volume at risk depending on the scale of military activity. Although the volume is small in terms of global trade flows, the quality is unique as over 67% of the output is heavy.

Signals

US military activity is ramping up near Venezuela with reports that the Trinidad and Tobago government supported the installation of a radar station at the Tobago airport for US use.

Venezuela supplies 1.1 million bpd of crude oil, mainly to China. This supply could be reduced or completely shut-in if an incursion occurs.

Dubai crude oil price premiums to ICE Brent will likely increase if Venezuelan supply is lost even in part. This will drive global heavy crude oil discounts to lighter grades to narrow until Venezuelan supply is re-established.

Venezuela claims to have the largest proven reserves in the world, around 300 billion barrels as of 2024, concentrated in the Orinoco belt with most being heavy oil. Rystad Energy estimate point towards 4 billion barrels of proven and 23 billion barrels of discovered reserves. In any case, large reserves prompted significant investment historically from a number of countries: China, Russia, Iran, and the US to name a few. Ultimately, irrespective of significant reserves, technical problems and underinvestment have resulted in steady declines in production since the early 2010s. At its peak, Venezuela was responsible for nearly 3 million bpd, but declines set in following a governmental change and nationalization of assets. A trough was hit in 2020 when the total averaged 624,000 bpd. In addition to the output drop, most of Venezuela’s refining capacity is not operational as facilities have fallen into disrepair. While many domestic refining facilities have stopped operating, the PDVSA (The Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A) does own and operate several locations internationally. CITGO, a majority-owned subsidiary of PDVSA, operates three refineries in the US (Lake Charles, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Lemont, Illinois) and is a subsidiary for a number of refineries in the Caribbean and Europe.

In 2024, Venezuela produced 975,000 bpd of crude oil, of which 657,000 bpd was heavy. Light and medium crude oil production averaged 116,000 and 201,000 bpd, respectively. Venezuela’s production was approximately 1% of global supply but 4.5% of global heavy crude oil supply in 2024. This year is expected to be a peak year, topping out at 1.11 million bpd. Production is expected to decline slowly to 901,000 bpd by the end of 2030.

Of this, the vast majority has historically been exported to either the US, China, Spain, or India. Pre-2020, the split of crude oil exports was relatively even between these four countries. As of 2025, however, US sanctions have forced exports to be diverted to China, which in 3Q25 was the destination for 81% of Venezuelan exports. Significant movements away from the US have been prompted in Venezuela by US sanctions which were enacted in 2019 on PDVSA that banned all imports of Venezuelan crude oil. More recently, 25% tariffs on all goods imported to the US from countries which directly or indirectly import Venezuela crude oil have further crippled flows to the US.

US Gulf Coast refineries are configured to process heavy crude oil for up to 30% of their slate, with some in the region capable of running in excess of 75% heavy oil. The sanctions on Venezuela crimped heavy oil supply for the US. China is also dependent on heavy crude supplies to maximize secondary conversion unit utilization. The Venezuelan grades are an ideal fit for these refineries, and the loss of supply would tighten the heavy crude oil balance. While the US no longer runs significant volume of Venezuelan oil, the overall tightening of the global heavy market would strengthen the prices for grades that the US does depend upon, namely the Canadian heavy crude oils that ship to the Pacific markets via the Trans Mountain Pipeline and to US markets through various other pipeline systems.

Dubai is a benchmark grade for the Pacific Basin crude market. It has been trading at a premium to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent, first with OPEC+ cutting production in 2024, then with deeper sanctions on Russian crude oil making illegal barrels more difficult to source. A temporary loss to Venezuelan production is expected to drive up the price of Dubai against ICE Brent as Asia scrambles to replace the barrels.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Rystad_chart_5jpeg.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 17:03:27.901259

Van Epps beat out Democrat Aftyn Behn by about 9 points in a district Donald Trump and Republican senator Marsha Blackburn each won in 2024 by 22 points. Yesterday’s vote shows a 13-point shift toward the Democrats in about a year.

Aaron Pellish and Meredith Lee Hill of Politico reported the comment of a House Republican after officials called the election: “Tonight is a sign that 2026 is going to be a b*tch of an election cycle. Republicans can survive if we play team and the Trump administration officials play smart. Neither is certain.”

As G. Elliott Morris of Strength in Numbers noted, “[t]he fact that a rural Tennessee district ended up just a high-single-digits win for Republicans should be a five-alarm fire for the party ahead of the 2026 midterms.” Morris explains that congressional special elections have swung 17 points on average toward the Democrats, while special elections for seats in state legislatures have swung toward the Democrats by about 11 points. Morris combines these results with turnout differences in special, midterm, and presidential elections, to estimate that—as of right now—the 2026 midterms can be expected to see a swing of 7 to 8 points toward the Democrats. These numbers would give Democrats control of the House of Representatives and put the Senate into play as well.

It is safe to assume, Morris says, “that something big has shifted in the national environment.” He adds that the Republican Party “will likely find itself defending an unusually wide array of seats next year, even in districts previously thought to be immune to national swings.”

Democrats and many Republicans think that shift has come about in large part over the issue of affordability, the rising costs of food, housing, energy, gasoline, and healthcare that are squeezing most Americans. Trump insisted yesterday that “affordability” doesn’t mean anything to anybody,” but most Americans would disagree. According to Morris of Strength in Numbers, the word “affordability” appears to mean not just the pressure of higher prices, but also frustration at economic stagnation, the unfair way in which the economic system operates, the idea of being stuck and unable to rise, the current illusiveness of the American dream.

After the voters rejected Republican candidates in the early November elections, Republicans vowed they would address affordability issues. Trump initially moved in that direction but now is rejecting the idea that his economic policies have caused hardship, although news dropped today from Automatic Data Processing (ADP), a private human resources management company, that the U.S. lost about 32,000 jobs last month. The losses were primarily in small businesses, which are often considered a bellwether for the rest of the economy.

The secretary of commerce, billionaire Howard Lutnick, admitted to CNBC that Trump’s policies have caused disruption, but promised they would start to build the economy in 2026. “Remember,” he said, “as you deport people, that’s going to suppress private job numbers of small businesses. But they’ll rebalance and they’ll regrow. So I think this is just a near-term event and you’ll see as the numbers come through over the next couple of months, you’ll see that all pass, and next year the numbers are going to be fantastic.”

On the table more immediately are the rising costs of health insurance premiums. The Republicans’ budget reconciliation bill of July extended tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations but neglected to extend the premium tax credits that supported the purchase of healthcare insurance on the Affordable Care Act insurance markets. The loss of those credits will throw at least two million people off healthcare insurance while driving up healthcare costs for millions more. This will undermine the Affordable Care Act, a goal many Republicans have held since the measure became law about fifteen years ago. But in September, close to 80% of Americans wanted the credits extended; as the issue became politicized, some Republicans withdrew their support so the number dropped to about 75%.

In October, Senate Democrats refused to agree to vote in favor of a continuing resolution to fund the government unless the Republicans extended that premium tax credit, but after weeks of party members calling attention to the issue, seven Democrats and one Independent voted in November to end the shutdown in exchange for a Senate vote on a measure to extend the tax credits.

That bill is now coming due, trapping Republicans between their ideology, which calls for slashing all government programs, and voters, who overwhelmingly want the credits extended.

Trump said he was going to produce a healthcare plan that would extend the premium tax credit for two years, along with new restrictions on who could use the credits, by last Monday but postponed the announcement after Republican lawmakers demanded the extension include a nationwide abortion ban. The White House has not indicated when a new plan might appear. On Air Force One, Trump told reporters he doesn’t actually want to extend the tax credits. “I’d rather not extend them at all,” he said. “It may be, some kind of an extension may be necessary to get something else done, because the Unaffordable Care Act has been a disaster.”

Kaia Hubbard of CBS News notes that any plan Senate Democrats come up with will need the support of 13 Republicans to pass the 60-vote Senate filibuster threshold. So far, though, Republican senators seem inclined not to extend the credits as they currently exist, but to try to force through a partisan measure that Democrats will not support. Republican senators are proposing different options, but say there is no point in figuring out their own position until Trump tells them what he is willing to sign.

In the House, Republicans in safe districts don’t want to extend the credits, saying that an end to support for the system will make it easier to kill the law they insist is a disaster. According to Alice Miranda Ollstein and Robert King of Politico, some Republican strategists think that voters won’t care about healthcare costs by the time of the midterm elections, especially if Republican policies bring down the costs of housing, energy, food, and gas. They think voters will be angrier at support for the Affordable Care Act than at higher healthcare costs.

Vulnerable Republicans disagree. They are calling for a temporary extension of the credits to help lower costs again before the midterms.

Meanwhile, House Democrats have announced they have 214 signatures on a discharge petition to force a vote on extending the tax credits and invited Republicans to join them to bring the measure to the floor. Today, Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar (D-CA) told reporters: “Republicans have said that they want an extension, that they support the Affordable Care Act tax credits. We’re giving them an opportunity to do that. That’s what this discharge petition is about. As Leader [Hakeem] Jeffries has said for months, Democrats will go anywhere and have any discussion with our Republican colleagues about addressing the Affordable Care Act tax credits or the affordability crisis. If Republicans want to have a conversation about solutions, we’re all ears.”

The declining fortunes of MAGA Republicans are widening the rifts in the party. Annie Karni of the New York Times reported today on House Republicans’ anger at Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who has defended the priorities of President Donald J. Trump at the expense of the interests of Republican lawmakers. Johnson’s letting Trump call the shots means the House has accomplished very little apart from passing the budget reconciliation bill Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a law the American people appear to hate.

Although Republicans hold the majority in the House, Johnson has kept the members subservient to Trump’s demands. He kept them out of session for almost eight weeks during the government shutdown, for example, to try to jam the Senate into either accepting the House version of a continuing resolution to fund the government or ending the filibuster to enable Trump to force through his unpopular policies. Now, angry that they will have to run in 2026 with little to show for their House majority, House members are talking to the media about their frustration with Johnson.

The Republicans have other concerns as well. Today House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) subpoenaed former special counsel Jack Smith to testify in private, rejecting Smith’s offer to testify in public. Smith wanted to testify in public to prevent committee members from leaking his comments selectively to the press, spinning them to mislead Trump loyalists. But public testimony could expose some of the evidence Smith gathered about President Trump’s participation in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and retention of classified documents.

In a statement, Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the top-ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked: “What are our colleagues so afraid of, that they won’t let the American people hear directly from the Special Counsel?... The American people deserve to hear the full unvarnished truth about Special Counsel Smith’s years-long effort to investigate and prosecute the crimes committed by Donald Trump and his co-conspirators.”

Also today, Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Jeffrey Merkley (D-OR), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), along with Representatives Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), wrote a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking for a briefing no later than Friday on what she has claimed is “new” material in the Epstein files that she said on November 14 had caused her to initiate investigations into connections between Jeffrey Epstein and former president Bill Clinton, former treasury secretary Larry Summers, and investor Reid Hoffman. On July 7, an FBI memo said there was no new evidence to open new investigations “against uncharged third parties.”

Now the bipartisan lead sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act from both chambers of Congress are calling out what looks to be Bondi’s attempt to shield Trump, first by saying that there was no information in the files that would warrant an investigation of “uncharged third parties” and then by opening such investigations on Democrats to muddy the waters and possibly claim that she could not release the files because of ongoing investigations.

The lawmakers noted they “are particularly focused on understanding the contents of any new evidence, information or procedural hurdles that could interfere with the Department’s ability [to] meet [the] statutory deadline” of December 19, and expressed their interest in making sure “the law is fully implemented.”

Duke Energy filed with NCUC to request an annual revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas ($727 million in 2027, and $275 million in 2028), which would mean a 15% increase over current revenues, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress ($528 million in 2027, $200 million in 2028), a 15.1% increase.
“I am pleased that the North Carolina Department of Justice is fighting for the people of North Carolina,” said Stein in a press release.
“Data centers suck up an incredible amount of energy, and energy costs are too high; as they are, they’re rising,” said Stein.
The Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission testified in 2023 that rates could ‘approximately double‘ before 2030.","Gov. Josh Stein opposes Duke Energy’s recent request with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) to revise rates at Duke Energy Carolina and Duke Energy Progress, which would include a 15% increase from current revenues.

Duke Energy filed with NCUC to request an annual revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas ($727 million in 2027, and $275 million in 2028), which would mean a 15% increase over current revenues, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress ($528 million in 2027, $200 million in 2028), a 15.1% increase. Duke Energy’s requests are based on a 10.95% return on equity and 53% equity capital structure; these requests are subject to approval by NCUC.

“I am pleased that the North Carolina Department of Justice is fighting for the people of North Carolina,” said Stein in a press release. “Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike is simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy. At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less. I will continue to fight on behalf of every North Carolinian to lower costs and grow the economy.”

During a recent press conference, Stein highlighted data centers as one of the facilities that consume a tremendous amount of energy. Stein’s newly formed council on energy policy will be taking a close look at data centers.

“Data centers suck up an incredible amount of energy, and energy costs are too high; as they are, they’re rising,” said Stein. “Duke Energy has just asked for a double-digit rate increase at the Utilities Commission, something that I hope is severely scrutinized and shrunk because electricity is too expensive as it is. We have to take a hard look at the state about what the impact of these data centers is on energy demand and is this the right way that we want to deploy a limited resource, we do not have infinite energy, and so we will have more insight into that question going forward.”

NC Secretary of Commerce Lee Lilley clarified that data centers are not typical recipients of Job Development Investment Grants (JDIG), as are companies like Toyota and Jet Zero.

“Those are not typically offered on a data center project for a variety of different reasons,” said Lilley during the same press conference. “They do qualify for other incentives and, in particular, may qualify for local economic development incentives, particularly around property tax abatement. That’s the decision of a local county, and I think that’s why you’ve seen different local jurisdictions approach data centers in different ways. I’d say thus far, the answer on data centers in North Carolina has really been left to a local decision and a decision about whether or not power is available.”

Lilley explained that he believes decisions like these will continue to be made at the local county level, while simultaneously balancing the policy question of prioritizing the use of power and who pays the bill for large projects that consume a lot of power.

“It seems Gov. Stein is starting to learn of the consequences of the Carbon Plan law,” Jon Sanders, director of the Center for Food Power and Life at the John Locke Foundation, told the Carolina Journal. “We have been warning for years that shutting down working, paid-for power plants (coal) and overbuilding expensive, land-intensive, but unreliable renewable facilities that need far more transmission lines built is a recipe for much higher rates. The Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission testified in 2023 that rates could ‘approximately double‘ before 2030. Strangely, Stein vetoed Senate Bill 266, which was nevertheless passed into law and which eliminated the interim goal of the Carbon Plan law that would have cost ratepayers an additional $13 billion by 2050.”

Sanders explains that if Stein wants to protect rate payers and ensure reliable utility service at the lowest rates possible, he should urge the General Assembly to amend the Carbon Plan law to remove the “carbon neutrality” mandate by 2050 and ensure that the primary focus of energy policy in North Carolina is reliable, low-cost electricity.

New Democratic North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson agreed with his predecessor, Stein.

“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” said Jackson in a press release. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2048px-Duke_Energy_Office.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 19:03:38.223917

The effects of such trade policy on final goods in retail are quite direct: higher prices cause consumers to pull back spending, dampening possibly not just short-term demand but also long-term demand depending on the duration of current trade policy. This dynamic could cause brick-and-mortar retailers to rethink their space needs if they believe depressed demand will last for an extended period of time. The effects on industrial commercial real estate, however, are perhaps less obvious. Nevertheless, the passthrough mechanism between goods demand and space demand for these two property types is now increasingly similar. Even with trade deals and exemptions, industrial properties in the U.S. have felt the effects.

Generally speaking, broad macroeconomic headwinds have led to sharp increases in warehouse and distribution vacancies, plateauing rent growth, and net negative absorption in many markets. Tariffs have only added to the strain, as warehouse and distribution space demand depends on storage and delivery demand for both intermediate goods and final goods. While causation related to tariffs is too strong of a conclusion, there is clear correlation. Some West Coast markets have experienced performance deterioration that significantly exceeds that of the national average. For example, while the U.S. has only seen a 50-basis-point increase in the warehouse and distribution vacancy rate year-over-year (see Figure 1), Los Angeles and Oakland–East Bay both exceeded 100-basis-point increases in the same metric even though inventory growth for both metros was below that of the national figure. However, other markets (e.g., San Diego and San Francisco) are on par or even show lower year-over-year vacancy rates, indicating a tightening market with sufficiently robust demand even with inventory growth that exceeds the national number, as is the case for San Diego. This pattern extends beyond the West Coast. Port cities along the East Coast whose daily tonnage is often skewed toward international cargo, like Philadelphia, are also feeling the impact.

Still, tariffs are only one factor behind weakening warehouse and distribution performance. In many cases, higher vacancy rates, and the accompanying weakness in rent growth, are more directly attributable to the amount of speculative square footage that has come online, despite a general slowdown in the new-supply pipeline nationally. Norfolk/Hampton Roads and Savannah are two prime examples as both markets have experienced outsized inventory growth year-over-year.

Two major headwinds for warehouse and distribution demand growth persist, both tied to final consumer goods spending: weak consumer sentiment over elevated inflation expectations, and the interaction between interest rates and borrowing costs, which has contributed to the plateauing of e-commerce growth.

The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment shows rapidly declining confidence. The November 2025 reading stands at 50.3 — just shy of the record low of 50.0 in July 2022 — as consumers worry about food and goods prices this holiday season. Much of that concern relates to inflation that has yet to meaningfully reach the policy target. Meanwhile, over the past four quarters of data, from the third quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2025, e-commerce’s share of retail sales has held steady, just above 16 percent, oscillating between 16.1 percent and 16.3 percent. The record high of 16.3 percent, first reached in the second quarter of 2020, was only matched again in the second quarter of 2025.

Flex and research and development (R&D) properties have been a notable exception to such deteriorating performance. As their name implies, they provide more flexibility. From retail to office space to warehousing for smaller enterprises, flex space provides a more dynamic environment and a smaller footprint for businesses to scale up or down with ease. Thus, although this industrial subtype has been far more insulated, data from the second half of 2025 is starting to indicate a softening due to this intermingling of uses and blurring of lines, given the agglomeration of the aforementioned macroeconomic factors.

Turning to activity in the capital markets for the warehouse and distribution subsector, transaction volume has picked up year-over-year in the West, both by nominal dollar amount and property count. While activity remains more muted than years past, transaction volume is up 17 percent from the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2025 and the median transaction cap rate is down 60 basis points over the same time period even though the 10-year Treasury yield increased by 30 basis points. The other regions of the country have not been as lucky, with either declining transaction volumes or increasing cap rates, or both. However, the South Atlantic, the only other region to experience an increase in transaction volume over the aforementioned period, saw median transaction cap rates increase just 25 basis points, on par with the 10-year Treasury yield, meaning that the risk premium over the risk-free rate remained unchanged.

Although demand softening has led to a sharp deceleration in the amount of square footage completing over the past year, as well as square footage under construction, investor appetite for existing properties remains strong. Sizeable industrial portfolios are trading across the country, with particular investor interest in newer construction that offers features like higher ceiling clearance and advanced automation capabilities. Despite ongoing concerns regarding valuations due to the current interest-rate and Treasury-yield environment, in the wake of slowing, and in some pockets, stagnant, net operating income growth, industrial portfolios are finding access to capital with loans issued for new purchases and refinancing.

This resilience is largely due to minimal borrower distress across the industrial sector. Delinquency rates remain low (the lowest across all of the core property types) — just 1.5 percent as of September 2025 — indicating temporary headwinds rather than a long-term downward trend.",https://cdn9.areadevelopment.com/article_images/id898_TariffImpacts1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:04:36.804578

On its face, the July 15th memo requires elevated review for solar energy permits.
Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, 143 solar energy companies sent a letter urging the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives to work with the Department of the Interior (DOI) to address the July DOI memo that has favored preferred energy sources and amounted to a near complete moratorium on permitting for solar projects. The letter also urges Congress to keep fairness and certainty at the center of permitting negotiations.

“Federal agencies are implementing this directive in a way that amounts to a nearly complete moratorium on permitting for any project in which the Department of Interior may play a role, on both federal and private land, no matter how minor,” wrote 143 solar companies in the letter. “Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects. Certainty must include a review process that does not discriminate by energy source. We urge Congress to keep fairness and certainty at the center of permitting negotiations.”

The letter outlines the numerous permitting processes that have been impacted since the DOI memo was issued on July 15, including permits that occur under any DOI agency for projects on federal lands and private lands; permits from non-DOI federal agencies where the DOI has a consultative role; and projects on private lands that utilize DOI resources.

“For America’s solar industry, permitting reform starts with permit certainty. As 143 solar companies wrote in their letter to our Congressional leaders, without action to address this unequal treatment of solar energy, the industry will continue to face significant barriers to deployment and investment at a time of skyrocketing energy demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “While the solar industry values the continued bipartisan engagement on permitting reform, the SPEED Act, as passed out of committee, falls short of addressing this core problem: the ongoing permitting moratorium.”

“To be clear, there is no question we need permitting reform,” Hopper continued. “There is an agreement to be reached, and SEIA and our 1,200 member companies will continue our months-long effort to advocate for a deal that ensures equal treatment of all energy sources, because the current status of this blockade is unsustainable.”

Last month, SEIA released an analysis of EIA data showing that more than 500 projects in the pipeline across the country are in danger of delays or cancellation as a result of political attacks.

Read the full letter here and below.

Dear Majority Leader Thune, Speaker Johnson, Minority Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader Jefferies,

As solar companies engaged in helping Americans across the country keep the lights on and prices low, we are writing today to express concern about the July 15 memo from the Secretary of Interior which creates burdensome red tape, effectively halting permitting for solar energy projects. This policy will significantly delay or cancel deployment of much-needed solar energy.

On its face, the July 15th memo requires elevated review for solar energy permits. However, federal agencies are implementing this directive in a way that amounts to a nearly complete moratorium on permitting for any project in which the Department of Interior may play a role, on both federal and private land, no matter how minor. This includes:

Permits and consultations that occur under any DOI agency for projects on federal lands or any other project with a clear federal nexus.

Permits and consultations for projects primarily on private lands that involve easements, rights-of-way or gen-ties crossing public land.

Permits and consultations for projects on private lands that occur under DOI agencies including those requiring compliance with Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.

Permits from non-DOI federal agencies (e.g. Army Corps of Engineers) for private land projects where the DOI has a consultative role such as wetland impacts, water crossings, or tree removal.

Projects on private land utilize DOI resources, such as IPaC, to determine species impacts.

We urge Congress to work with the Department of the Interior to address the unduly discriminatory and unprecedented government overreach, by revoking the July 15th memo.

In the alternative, we believe there are reasonable steps the Department of Interior can take in the short-term to prevent unnecessary delays in energy development that is currently poised to help meet the growing energy demands of AI and other industries.

Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects. Certainty must include a review process that does not discriminate by energy source. We urge Congress to keep fairness and certainty at the center of permitting negotiations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

###

The long-running legal saga surrounding the future of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum reached a major turning point after a federal judge approved the company’s $5.9 billion sale to Amber Energy. The decision follows years of litigation, global political implications, competing bids, and a highly watched court-supervised auction process.

U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark of the District of Delaware issued the approval after overseeing one of the largest court-ordered asset sales in modern history. According to Houston Public Media, the ruling moves Amber Energy closer to completing the acquisition in 2026, pending procedural steps, regulatory clearances, and final settlement of outstanding claims.

A Years-Long Path to the Sale

Citgo has been the center of legal conflict because it is owned by PDV Holding, a U.S.-based subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). The Venezuelan government’s debts and defaulted obligations prompted numerous creditors to pursue Citgo, one of Venezuela’s most valuable foreign assets.

Houston Public Media noted that earlier court rulings determined Citgo’s shares could be auctioned to compensate a Canadian mining company owed billions by PDVSA. That judgment opened the door to additional creditors and led to a complex, multi-round auction process supervised by the Delaware court.

The process required coordination among the U.S. government, creditor groups, court-appointed officials, and Citgo’s leadership as bids were secured and vetted.

Amber Energy Prepares for Transition

Following the judge’s announcement, Amber Energy CEO Gregory Goff stated the company plans to invest in Citgo’s operational future.

“We look forward to working with the talented CITGO team to strengthen the business through capital investment and operational excellence. I am confident that together we will help enhance America’s energy leadership position,” Goff said in a news release.

Citgo employs approximately 3,300 workers across three major U.S. refineries:

Corpus Christi, Texas

Lake Charles, Louisiana

Lemont, Illinois

The company also maintains branded fuel networks and extensive midstream and distribution operations. Houston Public Media reported that all existing Citgo operations are expected to continue functioning as the ownership transition progresses.

What’s Next

The transaction will move into its finalization phase, with completion expected in 2026, barring delays or new legal challenges. Additional steps include financial settlements, regulatory review, and execution of the purchase agreement as outlined by the Delaware court.

Citgo’s sale marks a significant moment in international energy, corporate law, and U.S.-Venezuela relations, concluding a dispute that has stretched across multiple countries, presidential administrations, and courts.

The US nuclear sector has been growing at an astonishing rate over the past few years, and has been boosted by the President’s mandate to revive the US nuclear market over his second term in office. Trump has been attempting to revive the nation’s nuclear sector to meet a substantial increase in energy demand that has swept across the nation and the world.

Terrestrial Energy has big plans to increase the US nuclear capacity over the next few years

Terrestrial has been working exceedingly hard to advance the status of its planned “Project Tetra”, which will significantly boost the US’s nuclear energy generation capacity. The company has noted that it plans to advance progress on its Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) technology, laying the groundwork for a commercial fleet by the early 2030s.

Terrestrial Energy’s small and modular IMSR plant is specifically designed to provide cost-effective energy for industrial operations, data centers, and domestic and international markets. The company has been making significant progress in advancing the IMSR technology, but it needs the support of the DOE and other federal institutions to further accelerate the progress that has already been made.

Terrestrial Energy has appointed two new crucial people to lead the company into a new era of nuclear energy production

While the company has been making strides in the advancement of its technology for the nuclear sector, it has now appointed Jim Howe as Vice President of Government Relations and David O’Keefe as Vice President of Business Development & Project Management. By doing so, it can now lobby the government for the much-needed support for the next step in developing the US nuclear sector.

The US-based nuclear firm will lean on the vast experience of its two new appointees

Jim Howe has significant experience working within the federal government infrastructure. He worked as a U.S. Coast Guard Captain for nearly two decades and has vast experience in the corridors of Washington. He served as an advisor to the Vice President of the United States, leading Congressional Affairs for the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard. Notably, he also advanced nuclear policy at ARC Clean Technology, Oklo, and Centrus Energy.

Mr David O’Keefe, on the other hand, brings his own set of skills to Terrestrial Energy after working as a business-development and finance expert and advisor for Centrus Energy and Pacific Gas & Electric. He will oversee the planned pipeline of IMSR plant deployment opportunities in the U.S. The US nuclear sector is growing, as evidenced by the news that Amazon will invest in a new 960 MW small modular nuclear facility in Washington state.

“Jim and David bring a wealth of valuable expertise in government relations and project management that will be critical to our ongoing efforts to commercialize IMSR technology. Their leadership further strengthens our ability to deliver clean firm and cost-competitive energy at scale for data centers, industry, and the U.S. grid – driving tangible long-term value for our shareholders and partners as America expands its nuclear-energy infrastructure.” – Simon Irish, CEO of Terrestrial Energy

LSVs are designed for usage in limited and use in local transportation including airports, tourist attractions, golf courses, hotels and resorts, residential and business complexes, and others. Utility and off-road vehicles are utilized for commercial and personal use in slow-speed areas.

Significant factors impacting the increasing investment in low-speed, owing to the upsurge in demand from the developing nations, technological advancement in the automotive industry coupled with increasing investment and support from the government for the development of low-speed electric vehicles market. However, the high price of batteries used in these vehicle are restricting the market growth.

According to the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highway in 2022 there were approx. 1,037,011 electric vehicles registered within the country, which accounted roughly 6.4% of the overall automobile sales within the country. Moreover, in 2021, the government released a handbook guide to EV infrastructure in India the focuses on the development of infrastructure in the country. In 2021, the publicly accessible charging station accounted for 900 in India, which jumped to nearly 11,000 in 2022. Countries around the globe are fostering the development of EVs, which is expected to provide opportunities for the low speed electric vehicle market share during the forecast period.

Governments and regulatory bodies are implementing strict regulations towards vehicle pollution; this is the major reason driving the demand for low-speed electric vehicles during the study period. The market demand for LSEV in developing countries, particularly in Asia-Pacific, is expected to be more than in developed regions in Europe and North America.

Rapid industrialization and rising disposable income drive regional growth. As rural-to-urban migration increases, customers want cheaper, greener transportation. Government measures are also advancing electric car technology, boosting growth. Over the past few decades, crude oil prices have steadily risen, shifting people’s focus from internal combustion engines to electric automobiles. This spurred manufacturers to create electric and low-emission vehicles.

For instance, in May 2022, Wuling Motors, a China-based automobile company, partnered with SAIC Motor and General Motors and developed the Wuling Mini EV, with a cost price of USD 5,000; the model outperformed the Tesla Model 3 in China. The low speed EV is only available in China, the car can carry 4 people and has some built-in standards features such as air conditioning, power windows, stereo system, storage, and compartments. Moreover, the car is also equipped with safety features such as anti-lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring sensors, and rear parking sensors. The rise in technological advancement in low-speed electric vehicles, along with rising income levels and the desire to own personal vehicles, will continue to drive the demand in countries such as China, India, and Southeast Asian countries during the forecast period.

Now in its fifth year, the ARI Grant Program recognizes and rewards farmers and ranchers working to make Santa Clara County’s agricultural lands more resilient to drought, heat, and changing climate conditions. Launched by the County Consumer and Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Agriculture, the program provides up to $30,000 per recipient for practices such as compost and mulch application, managed grazing, and other climate-friendly practices. These conservation practices mitigate greenhouse gasses, improve soil health, capture carbon from the air, and help farmland retain water, which are essential for the long-term sustainability of local agriculture.

“Santa Clara County is a leader in policies that protect farmland, strengthen local economies, and promote environmental stewardship,” said County Agricultural Commissioner Priscilla Yeaney. “ARI Grants allow us to partner with local farmers and provide them with the tools to help fight climate change right in their fields.”

The County received more than 25 competitive applications this year, reflecting growing local interest in climate-smart farming.

""Each applicant represents the innovation and determination that define Santa Clara County's agricultural community,"" said Julie Morris, the County's agricultural liaison. ""The success of this program has become a model for sustainable land management and climate action.""

Past recipients shared how these funds are helping them turn environmental goals into everyday practices.

“For a small farmer working hard to build healthy soil, this support arrived like a godsend at just the right time,” said Durgaprasad Ala, owner of Dil Farm in Gilroy. “The funds gave me confidence to experiment with cover crops and compost—natural ways to improve soil. It’s inspired me to share what I’ve learned with other growers who also want to farm sustainably.”

“The grant made it possible to apply compost across 34 acres of pasture, which is about 26 football fields,” said Ligimol Kedongaparambil, owner of Shillingsburg Farm in San José. “Through collaboration with the County, we were able to purchase enough quality compost at an affordable price from the local composting facility, which happens to be made up of yard trimmings collected from households throughout the County.”

Their stories illustrate how local agriculture, often thought of as a quiet industry in present day Santa Clara County, is in fact a frontline partner in climate action.

“Our farmers and ranchers are the foundation of our valley,” said Supervisor Sylvia Arenas. “Every acre improved through this program strengthens not only our food system, but also the health and well-being of Santa Clara County families.”

The County will begin accepting proposals for the next round of ARI funding in early 2026.

Addis Energy is backed by At One Ventures, Engine Ventures, Pillar VC, and Voyager Ventures.","Addis Energy, a company harnessing the Earth’s potential for affordable, abundant ammonia production, today announced it has raised $8.3 million in an oversubscribed seed round, bringing the company’s total funding to date to $17.3 million. The round was led by At One Ventures, with existing investors Engine Ventures and Pillar VC also participating. Addis Energy will use the fresh capital to further advance its AI-aided laboratory of chemical reactors that simulate subsurface conditions to produce ammonia at a cost advantage versus Haber-Bosch through a net energy-positive process. The company will also use the capital to expand its operations team and prepare for its first field pilot demonstration.

Ammonia is a critical component of the global food supply, with approximately 70% used to make fertilizer. Demand for ammonia is projected to increase 25% over the next five years; however, traditional ammonia production is extremely energy intensive, consuming ~2% of global energy. Over a third of traditional ammonia production costs come from consumption of natural gas as a feedstock and fuel for the high temperature, high pressure reaction. Addis Energy is scaling a fundamentally new approach to replace the energy-intensive process of traditional ammonia production. By identifying ferrous rocks, injecting water, nitrogen and catalyst to drive an ammonia synthesis reaction, the company leverages the chemical potential of iron plus the natural heat and pressure of the subsurface. Addis Energy dramatically decreases the energy intensity and costs versus typical ammonia produced from natural gas.

“By merging chemical innovation developed out of MIT with on-the-ground oil and gas industry experience, Addis Energy is enabling energy abundance and affordability, and creating new economic opportunities for domestic energy production with zero emissions,” said Michael Alexander, CEO and co-founder of Addis Energy. “Considering the U.S. imports ~12% of the domestic ammonia supply, we have a timely opportunity to create a new platform for U.S.-led, domestic clean fuel and chemical production. This funding will allow us to scale our novel approach to ammonia production and get ‘shovel-ready’ for our first pilot.”

Following its January 2025 launch, Addis Energy has:

Signed a partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, one of the U.S. Department of Energy’s national laboratories, to conduct reactive transport modeling based on the laboratory’s expertise drilling wells and modeling chemical reactions in carbon sequestration and in-situ mining.

Sourced 600+ rock samples from various geologies and rock formations across the U.S. to demonstrate cost-advantage production of ammonia in new locations where natural gas supply isn’t abundant.

Hired 3 new full-time employees, with Douglas Wicks, previously the Program Director at ARPA-E, the U.S. Department of Energy’s advanced energy research agency, and Doug Hollett, previously the Acting Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, also joining as advisors.

“Addis Energy is not trying to “green” ammonia. They’re throwing out the model entirely. Instead of spending billions to recreate extreme pressure and heat above ground, they use what already exists underground. The Earth becomes the reactor,” said Laurie Menoud, Partner at At One Ventures. “Haber-Bosch is one of the most efficient industrial processes ever built, which is exactly why incremental innovations won’t compete with it. The only way to win is to change the physics and the system architecture. Addis is doing both. And that’s how you get a cost curve that incumbents simply can’t follow.”

In the coming months, Addis Energy will work to complete its nation-wide geological mapping and prepare for its first pilot field test.

Dive Brief:

Wolfspeed said it has received $698.6 million in cash tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service through a provision of the CHIPS and Science Act, strengthening its cash position after filing for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Wolfspeed is expecting about $1 billion in total from the CHIPS Act provision, which would accelerate its transition from 150-millimeter to 200-millimeter wafer technology. The company sought the 25% tax rebate after spending billions of dollars on a materials plant in Chatham County, North Carolina, and its Mohawk Valley fab in Utica, New York.

The North Carolina-based semiconductor company now has a cash balance of $1.5 billion following receipt of funds from the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit under Section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code, according to an investor filing on Monday.

Dive Insight:

The refund comes months after Wolfspeed exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September, a move that was related to weak demand and financial struggles. The semiconductor manufacturer received approval to cut its total debt by 70% and lower its annual cash interest payments by 60% as part of its restructuring plan. The company ended its latest quarter with $926 million in cash and investments, prior to the tax refund.

“This substantial cash infusion further strengthens our liquidity position at a critical phase in Wolfspeed’s strategic evolution,” CFO Gregor Van Issum said in a statement Monday. “It provides us with the financial agility to support long-term growth, manage our capital structure responsibly, and continue driving innovation across the silicon carbide value chain for our customers.”

As part of its lender agreement, Wolfspeed said it plans to allocate $192.2 million of the refund to paying down $175 million of debt, with the remaining funds for “general corporate purposes.”

Wolfspeed has been focused on ramping production of its 200mm silicon carbide products in Chatham County. In addition to supporting its electric vehicle customers, the company said it wants to reach growing markets, such as artificial intelligence data centers, aerospace, defense, industrial and energy.

Wolfspeed is also winding down its 150mm wafer production. It has been taking last-time buy orders from customers with plans to officially close its Durham, North Carolina, factory by the end of the calendar year, Issum said in an earnings call Oct. 29. Wolfspeed previously shared plans to shutter the plant over a year ago.

The company generated revenue of $196.8 million in its fiscal first quarter that ended Sept. 30, up 1% from last year. Roughly half of that total came from its 200mm Mohawk Valley fab in Marcy, New York. Wolfspeed also posted a net loss of $643.6 million during the period, largely due to one-time costs related to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Looking ahead, Issum said the company is seeing a “meaningful shift” across its key markets and developing a new sustainable, long-term plan for the future while experiencing near-term soft demand. He added that Wolfspeed will provide more details on its plan in the first half of 2026.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/I01OrZ1j0omox5pYiM5zAjv5xLa7ZTov7e4zwj9YwTg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS93b2xmc3BlZWQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-04 14:02:08.018008

Janus tie-in: Project Pele—of course— is not the only nuclear power–related undertaking of the DOD or the broader federal government.","This fuel will be used for the Project Pele microreactor being developed through a collaboration among the three parties (alongside the Department of Energy) and represents a major milestone for the project. As Jeff Waksman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment, put it, “This is real nuclear microreactor fuel delivered at its final destination, rather than some letter or memorandum promising to make fuel at a later date.”

More details: According to INL—and despite announcements coming out this week—the 40,000 fuel compacts that made up the shipment were delivered on November 5 (a video of the delivery is available here). BWXT manufactured and shipped the fuel from its facilities in Lynchburg, Va., where the company is also constructing the prototype reactor.

BWXT plans to begin formal system testing as early as 2027 and begin producing electricity at INL as soon as 2028.

While the SCO is leading Project Pele, INL director John Wagner highlighted how instrumental the DOE network has been in facilitating this project, saying, “This milestone reflects years of dedicated effort by the Office of Nuclear Energy’s Advanced Gas Reactor TRISO Fuel Qualification Program to fabricate and qualify TRISO fuel using world-class capabilities at INL’s Advanced Test Reactor and Materials and Fuels Complex, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory—capabilities that exist nowhere else in the world.”

Pele background: In May 2019, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, DOE, and SCO signed a preliminary MOU on microreactor research laying the groundwork for Project Pele. The original goal of the project was to develop a transportable 1–5 MWe advanced microreactor.

In March 2020, the DOD awarded contracts for three projects under Pele: one to BWXT, one to Westinghouse, and one to X-energy. BWXT emerged as the frontrunner in the project with its 1.5-MWe high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor.

In August 2023 (in a webinar organized by the American Nuclear Society), Waksman said that if all went according to plan, the reactor would be turned on at INL before the end of calendar year 2025. The new operational date of 2028 represents a three-year delay in prior plans but still aims to meet a September 30, 2028, deadline set by President Trump’s Executive Order 14299.

In September 2024, the DOD announced that it had broken ground at INL’s Critical Infrastructure Test Range Complex, where the reactor is set to be tested. In July 2025, BWXT announced that it had started fabrication on the Pele reactor core.

Janus tie-in: Project Pele—of course— is not the only nuclear power–related undertaking of the DOD or the broader federal government. Most directly related is the recently announced Janus Program, which seeks to deploy an operational demonstration microreactor power plant on a U.S. military installation by 2030. The DOD has stated that Janus will build on lessons learned from Pele and that the “laboratory teams which partnered on the technical, legal, and policy aspects of Project Pele will also be working closely on the Janus Program.”

Waksman reiterated this most recently in BWXT announcement, saying, “the army’s Janus Program will follow on to deliver affordable, reliable, commercial nuclear power to ensure that our critical infrastructure has power, even if the electric grid is disrupted.” In November, nine sites were selected for possible deployment as part of the program.

Don’t forget ANPI: Project Pele and the Janus Program are running parallel to the DOD’s separate Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program, which was launched in 2024 to deploy microreactor systems at military sites. At the launch of the program, the DOD aimed to have two microreactors operational on military bases by 2030. In April of this year, the DOD announced eight companies that are eligible to receive Other Transaction Awards for the project.

At this year’s annual conference of the Association of the U.S. Army, Waksman reportedly said that Janus will differ from ANPI by virtue of having different technical requirements, reflecting recent changes in the nuclear power market, including new companies that have emerged since last year.",https://www.ans.org/file/22948/l/Picture1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 14:01:15.943614

Practical Implications The Proposed Rule could substantially reduce permitting burdens and shorten project timelines.
Conclusion The Proposed Rule represents a significant shift toward narrowing federal jurisdiction under the CWA, potentially reducing permitting burdens for developers and landowners while increasing reliance on state and local regulation.
Stakeholders should consider reviewing the Proposed Rule carefully and may wish to submit comments by the January 5, 2026, deadline.","On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps, together the “Agencies”) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) in the Federal Register to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).[1]

The Proposed Rule represents the Agencies’ second effort to implement the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA[2], which narrowed federal authority over wetlands. If finalized, the rule would limit federal jurisdiction, reducing the number of projects requiring Section 404 dredge-and-fill permits and Section 401 water quality certifications. Public comments are due January 5, 2026.

Background

The CWA applies to “navigable waters,” defined as “waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.”[3] But Congress did not provide a precise definition of WOTUS, leading to decades of litigation, regulatory revisions, and uncertainty.

In Sackett, the Supreme Court clarified that WOTUS includes only relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans—and wetlands that have a continuous surface connection to those waters. Intermittent, ephemeral, or hydrologically isolated waters are generally not jurisdictional.

After Sackett, the Agencies issued their “Amended 2023 Rule”[4] to align with the Court’s guidance. Stakeholders, however, raised concerns that the rule did not fully comply with Sackett and created implementation challenges. The Proposed Rule seeks to address these concerns by clarifying which waters are jurisdictional, redefining key terms, and expanding certain exclusions.

Key Changes in the Proposed Rule

1. Federal Jurisdiction Focuses on Relatively Permanent Waters

Under the Proposed Rule, WOTUS would include only:

Traditional navigable waters (TNW) and the territorial seas;

Most impoundments of WOTUS;

Relatively permanent tributaries (RPT) of TNW, the territorial seas, and impoundments;

Wetlands with a continuous surface connection to TNW, RPT, or impoundments; and

Lakes and ponds with a continuous connection to TNW or RPT.

Key definitions:

Relatively Permanent: Waters that stand or flow year-round or at least during the wet season.[5] Intermittent flow or seasonal flows outside the wet season do not qualify.

Continuous surface connection: Wetlands must touch (abut) a jurisdictional water and hold surface water at least during the wet season. Only the portions meeting both criteria are jurisdictional.

Tributaries: Waters with a bed and bank and relatively permanent flow that connect to downstream TNW or the territorial seas, directly or through features that convey relatively permanent flow. Culverts, ditches, berms, or other barriers that do not convey relatively permanent flow generally do not establish jurisdiction.

2. Interstate Waters No Longer Automatically Jurisdictional

The Proposed Rule removes the default federal jurisdiction for interstate waters. Such waters are now jurisdictional only if they meet another WOTUS category (TNW, RPT, or adjacent wetlands).

The Agencies explain that neither Sackett nor prior Supreme Court decisions support federal regulation of all interstate waters regardless of size or connectivity.[6] Non-jurisdictional interstate waters would instead be regulated by States and Tributes under their sovereign authorities.

3. Expanded and Clarified Exclusions

The Proposed Rule clarifies and broadens key exclusions:

Waste Treatment Systems: All components designed to convey, treat, retain, or remove pollutants—such as lagoons or treatment ponds—remain excluded. This reflects longstanding policy since 1979.

Ditches: Non-navigable ditches constructed entirely on dry land remain excluded, even if they carry relatively permanent flow. Ditches constructed within wetlands or that relocate a tributary may still be jurisdictional.

Prior Converted Cropland: Remains excluded unless abandoned (no agricultural use for more than five years with reversion to wetland).

Groundwater: Explicitly excluded, including groundwater drained through subsurface systems. However, groundwater that surfaces and contributes to a relatively permanent stream may still be jurisdictional.

Section 404(f) Agricultural Exemptions: Continue to protect many routine farming, ranching, irrigation, and pond construction activities without federal permits.

Practical Implications

The Proposed Rule could substantially reduce permitting burdens and shorten project timelines. Many greenfield and master-planned community developments may no longer require Section 404 permits, and projects that previously triggered compensatory mitigation could proceed without it. Similarly, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews—which are often triggered solely by the need for a Section 404 permit—may be avoided. These impacts are likely to be most significant in arid and western states, where ephemeral or intermittent waters would generally fall outside federal jurisdiction.

As federal oversight narrows, state and local authorities are expected to fill the regulatory gap. Approximately half of U.S. states, along with the District of Columbia, already regulate wetlands more broadly than the CWA. States such as Washington and Oregon are considering or implementing state-level dredge-and-fill programs. In these jurisdictions, wetlands lacking a continuous surface connection to a WOTUS may only require state permitting, rather than federal authorization, highlighting the growing importance of state-level compliance.

Conclusion

The Proposed Rule represents a significant shift toward narrowing federal jurisdiction under the CWA, potentially reducing permitting burdens for developers and landowners while increasing reliance on state and local regulation. Stakeholders should consider reviewing the Proposed Rule carefully and may wish to submit comments by the January 5, 2026, deadline.

The scale of change is staggering. Data centers, industrial growth, electric vehicles, and new generation sources are driving electricity demand to levels unseen. At the same time, climate imperatives require rapid deployment of clean energy infrastructure. Yet, every mile of transmission line, every interconnection agreement, and every investment decision is governed by complex legal rules that vary across jurisdictions.

Legal frameworks set the pace of progress. They define who pays for transmission upgrades, how quickly new generation is deployed, and what environmental safeguards apply. They influence whether projects move forward—or stall for years in regulatory limbo. The law is not a spectator in the grid revolution; it is a central player.

What’s at Stake?

Timely grid modernization is essential to powering the next generation of technological innovation and, in turn, economic competitiveness and national security Conversely, an outdated grid increases reliability risks, impedes the interconnection of new resources, and incumbers states from achieving their decarbonization targets. A well-designed legal strategy can unlock billions in investment, accelerate innovation, and open pathways to new energy resources.

For energy companies, large energy users and project developers , understanding these dynamics is essential. Litigation risks, environmental obligations, and financing structures are evolving rapidly, and regulatory decisions today will shape business models for decades.

Huang said U.S. competitiveness now depended on its ability to expand electricity generation as AI workloads surge.
Huang’s warning came as the U.S. intensified its efforts to upgrade federal permitting and expand domestic energy production.
He argued that the United States should compete globally rather than withdraw from markets that shape technical standards.
He said the United States could maintain its global leadership if it expanded energy capacity, modernized permitting rules, and restored domestic manufacturing.","WASHINGTON, Dec. 4, 2025 - The United States needs to rapidly expand energy capacity, accelerate data-center construction and rebuild domestic industrial infrastructure, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Without the energy expansion, warned the helm of the advanced chips manufacturer and the world’s highest-valued company, the U.S. risks losing long-term leadership in artificial intelligence.

AI progress “does not start with GPUs” but with the electricity and physical capacity needed to compute at scale, he said at the bipartisan CSIS think tank.

China had structural advantages across what he called the “five-layer stack” of AI - energy, chips, infrastructure, models, and applications - even as U.S. firms continued to design the world’s most advanced semiconductors. For example, China produced roughly twice the electricity of the U.S., giving it the power capacity required for semiconductor fabrication plants and AI supercomputing clusters.

Also, China now accounts for nearly 70 percent of global AI patents and said the U.S.’s effective exit from the Chinese market had ensured domestic Chinese companies would build their own full AI stack and export it abroad.

Huang pointed to China’s enormous consumer markets and dense manufacturing networks as factors that allow it to commercialize AI applications at scale, especially in robotics, logistics, and industrial automation.

China is constructing data centers at speeds the U.S. ‘cannot match’

He said China was constructing AI data centers at speeds U.S. firms “cannot match,” with approvals, land allocation, and full buildouts completed within months.

Huang said U.S. competitiveness now depended on its ability to expand electricity generation as AI workloads surge. He said NVIDIA continued improving chip-level efficiency “by five or ten times each year,” but demand for AI computation “is going up by a factor of 10,000 to a million.” He said chip fabs, robotics hubs, and hyperscale AI data centers could not be built or operated without dramatic expansion in national power supply.

Huang’s warning came as the U.S. intensified its efforts to upgrade federal permitting and expand domestic energy production. President Donald Trump issued a series of directives this year requiring agencies to accelerate environmental reviews, digitize permitting systems, and fast-track infrastructure projects - including data centers, transmission lines, and semiconductor facilities - to reduce multiyear delays.

Such reforms are necessary if the country expects to meet the energy and construction demands of next-generation AI.

U.S. export controls a burden

Huang also warned that U.S. export controls and Chinese countermeasures have effectively removed NVIDIA from the world’s second-largest AI market. He said the company was now “banned on both sides,” leaving Chinese firms such as Huawei positioned to scale domestically without direct U.S. competition. “We have conceded essentially the entire market to them,” he said.

He argued that the United States should compete globally rather than withdraw from markets that shape technical standards.

When asked about AI’s impact on the labor force, Huang said AI would reorganize work by automating tasks rather than eliminating occupations. Radiology is an example where AI increased capacity without reducing demand for specialists.

Both the U.S. and China face severe labor shortages in manufacturing, a dynamic he said would accelerate adoption of robotics, with China positioned to scale faster because of its engineering talent and domestic demand.

U.S. strengths

Despite the competitive pressures, Huang said the United States still held major strengths, including leadership in advanced semiconductor design, world-class research universities, and a startup ecosystem capable of turning scientific breakthroughs into commercial products. He said U.S. companies continued to define global AI software tools and that many of the most widely adopted model architectures originated in American labs.

Huang said the next decade would deliver major advances in biotechnology, materials science, and robotics, much of it driven by American research institutions applying AI to scientific discovery. He said the United States could maintain its global leadership if it expanded energy capacity, modernized permitting rules, and restored domestic manufacturing. “This is the one decade I simply will not miss,” he said.

“The best of days are ahead of us,” Huang said, “but only if we build the infrastructure to support them.”",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/12/AP25304389918382-jensen.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 17:02:16.468803

The utility is asking the state for expedited approval of the company’s contracts with Oracle Corp. for a data center planned in Saline Township, near Ann Arbor.
The data center is part of Stargate, OpenAI’s $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure around the United States.
DTE Electric has asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast-track approval for its plan with Oracle to power the data center.
“Bringing on a data center of this size means more renewables, and more battery storage,” DTE said in a statement.","Michigan residents demanded more scrutiny of the plan to provide electricity to a proposed data center in rural Washtenaw County on Wednesday night.

They also expressed frustration and distrust with DTE Energy. The utility is asking the state for expedited approval of the company’s contracts with Oracle Corp. for a data center planned in Saline Township, near Ann Arbor.

The facility would require 1.4 gigawatts of power from the electricity provider. The data center is part of Stargate, OpenAI’s $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure around the United States.

DTE Electric has asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast-track approval for its plan with Oracle to power the data center. That would bypass a process called a ""contested case"" that requires the commission to consider evidence and testimony from a variety of sources. Michigan’s Attorney General expressed alarm about the process, calling the hearing “performative listening” in a rebuke last month.

A small group of protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon across the street from DTE Energy’s Detroit headquarters. They were unhappy that DTE has tried to push plans for the data center through without public hearing.

Sarah Brabbs is from York Township, next to Saline. While she is not totally opposed to a data center, she said she’s not a fan of DTE trying to push the project through without allowing the public in on the process.

“Putting rate payers in a situation that you know we will be paying for, probably on multiple levels, is disingenuous, dysfunctional, and unacceptable,” Brabbs said.

Others at the protest said they’re concerned about the potential environmental impact, like how much water the facility could use and the amount of energy it would need to function.

“The access to the Great Lakes, they’re definitely taking advantage of whatever God-given resource in order to just implement whatever quantum, whatever new level of science and technology that they haven’t got consent from the people on if they even want it in the first place,” said Elijah Williams.

At a virtual hearing Wednesday evening drew almost 90 participants. About 45 people spoke over the two and a half hours, with more in queue when the meeting ended at 9 p.m.

A few speakers voiced support for the project. Most of the supporters represented trade unions or business associations who supported the project for creating jobs.

Randall Whitaker is the president of the Washtenaw County Skilled Building Trades Council. He said the project was an investment in Michigan’s workforce.

“A project like this is huge for workers,” he said.

Constructing the data center would create about 2,500 union jobs, according to DTE’s application. Other supporters argued that the facility would generate millions in tax revenue and attract talent to Michigan.

DTE has said it expects the facility to increase its current peak electrical load by about 25%, but building out the capacity to accommodate that demand would not affect current ratepayers. DTE argues in its application that the data center won’t impact existing customers’ rates because of safeguards they’ve placed in the contracts with Oracle.

“The project strengthens Michigan’s long-term competitiveness in the fast-growing AI and advanced computing sectors, helping ensure our state remains a destination for innovation and talent,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement supporting the project.

But most participants opposed DTE’s request, citing the same concerns as the protesters - future electricity costs, how much water the facility would use, and whether the data center would actually benefit the local community.

Nichole Biber is a member of the Little Traverse Band of Odawa Indians, one of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan. She said she doesn’t trust DTE or Oracle to do what’s best for residents.

“These ‘meaningful guardrails,’ from what I've heard so far, are all on the assurances of DTE and the multibillion dollar corporations that are pushing AI and data centers on us,” she said. “That does not reassure me.”

DTE’s application, which includes the contracts with Oracle, is partially redacted.

Maggie Kaercher, who runs a small fish farm in Dexter and also attended the hearing, said she wants the commission to deny DTE’s request and have the application available for a more thorough review.

“You can't pretend that there's transparency when there is so much redacted out of the papers that we've been able to see,” she said.

“What we are asking, and what many other people are asking for as well, is that the Commission give DTE's proposal the proper scrutiny and ensure transparency,” said Katie Duckworth, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

“Because this is the largest data center to be proposed in Michigan, and it's one of the largest in the nation,” Duckworth said at the hearing.

Duckworth said the organization is concerned with how the data center’s power load will impact DTE’s ability to comply with Michigan’s climate change plans.

“It would also significantly increase the company's renewable energy obligation under Michigan's clean energy laws,” she said.

DTE is prepared for that challenge, the company said.

“Bringing on a data center of this size means more renewables, and more battery storage,” DTE said in a statement. The company also said the data center’s operators will finance the energy generation and storage needed to run the facility.

Duckworth said that solution would be “transformational” for DTE’s grid – if it happens.

“It raises a lot of questions including as to how those batteries would be charged and whether they will be charged by renewable energy, or whether it would involve prolonging the life of polluting fossil fuel plants or even building additional fossil fuel plants in the future,” she said.

Oracle expects the facility to open in December 2026. It won’t reach its maximum capacity of 1.4 gigawatts until December 2027, according to DTE’s application to the commission.

In October, DTE asked the commission to issue a decision by Friday, December 5. The commission is meeting at 1 p.m. that day.

Since the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states have scrambled to advance their clean energy progress against the barrage of threats and rollbacks to both renewable investments and financial incentives that support homes and businesses. But with the passage of Illinois Senate Bill 25—the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act—on October 30, 2025, a beacon of hope is fixed upon the Prairie State.

The CRGA Act is a massive, comprehensive energy package initiated by NRDC and our partners in the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, along with Governor JB Pritzker and House and Senate leadership.

In spite of federal headwinds, NRDC is going on the offense to drive climate progress forward at the state level. The problems we set to solve for with the CRGA Act were twofold:

Reliability: Illinois has been in desperate need of a smart, efficient grid that can best optimize clean energy connectivity and keep the lights on when we’re faced with ever-increasing extreme weather events.

Affordability: Energy capacity prices, which consumers pay through monthly utility bills, have increased exponentially as grid operators have proven they are slow to connect cheap, clean energy to our system.

Over the last two years, NRDC dug into the solutions. We engaged with climate, consumer, and environmental justice advocates; utilities; state agencies and elected officials; organized labor; renewable energy companies; and more.

Backed by science, analysis, and best-practice policy, the solutions are commonsense:

1) Reduce the amount of electricity needed to power our homes and businesses

2) Build more clean energy supply

3) Modernize the grid’s physical infrastructure

4) Plan more comprehensively and transparently for our energy future

The following is a snapshot of the critical highlights of the CRGA Act that accomplish just what the state needs and Illinoisans demand.

Reducing electric demand

Strengthens electric utility energy efficiency programs that provide consumers with financial incentives for technologies like heat pumps and wall insulation to reduce electricity waste and lower monthly utility bills. Going forward, utilities will need to save the equivalent of 2 percent of their annual electricity sales to customers—one of the highest targets in the country. That might not seem like a big number on the surface, but we estimate that through these strengthened programs, the equipment and building upgrades invested in a given year will, over their lifetime, save enough electricity to power more than two million homes for a year. The bill also triples existing requirements on minimum income-qualified investment and increases the amount of appliance electrification these programs can facilitate.

Requires utilities and alternative electric suppliers to offer customers opt-in “time of use” electric rates so that households and small businesses can better prioritize activities that use a lot of electricity—like running your clothes dryer or charging your electric vehicle (EV)—when prices are low.

Building energy supply

Requires the Illinois Power Agency to procure 3 gigawatts of large-scale battery storage by 2030, expanding our grid’s capacity and keeping electric capacity costs under control. These batteries will store excess generation from solar and wind energy and then dispatch it to the grid when it’s most needed, like at peak times in the evenings or during emergency grid events. This ambitious storage procurement is estimated to provide the equivalent power consumed by half a million homes over 24 hours during times of need.

Enhances various initiatives for increased solar energy deployment, such as allowing annual renewable portfolio standard financing limits to be increased and adjusted with inflation, as well as reforming clean energy interconnection dispute processes and expanding minimum standards for solar project siting.

Stands up various policies that invest in geothermal energy and community thermal energy networks, which will facilitate infrastructure projects that transfer heat in and out of buildings using zero-emission thermal energy.

Modernizing the grid

Amends the existing Renewable Energy Access Plan to study transmission headroom—the grid’s available capacity to accommodate growth—and identify opportunities for advanced transmission technologies. Based on the assessments, utilities will be encouraged to deploy these modern and cost-effective technologies that maximize powerlines’ ability to carry clean electricity and reduce unnecessary bottlenecks within our infrastructure.

Requires ComEd and Ameren to roll out opt-in virtual power plant programs where Illinoisans can allow certain smart technologies, like EV chargers and smart thermostats, to be centrally managed during times of high energy demand. Customers can then be compensated for providing grid services and reducing peak demand.

Requires ComEd and Ameren to meet timelines for connecting large EV charging stations to the grid, making it easier and more predictable for businesses to invest in large charging stations across the state.

Setting the state on the path for better energy planning

Initiates a statewide integrated resource plan (IRP) which, beginning in 2026 and every four years thereafter, will bring together state agencies, utilities, and advocates to evaluate our state’s energy needs and rightsize our clean energy targets and investment into demand-reduction resources. The IRP also allows for more efficient utilization of the existing power grid, which will help new power plants come online faster. The Illinois Commerce Commission will coordinate with regional grid operators PJM and MISO to replace retiring fossil power plants with new clean ones at the same site and allow resources like battery storage to plug in alongside aging power plants to maximize their efficiency.

Corrects a long-ignored definition of the true societal cost of carbon emissions in Illinois law, updating it to reflect science-based assessments of the damage caused by emissions that will ensure assessments in utility investments properly value climate benefits.

All in all, the CRGA Act is a momentous win for accelerating our transition to a clean energy future. CRGA expands family-sustaining jobs, protects consumers from volatile price spikes, and invests in Illinois residents while the federal government drops the ball.

So, what's next?

Though the CRGA Act was originally introduced with strong provisions regulating data centers, negotiations with key stakeholders proved we needed more time to ensure holistic protections are legislatively mandated. What ultimately made it into the bill minimizes the air pollution impact of diesel-powered backup generators at data centers by requiring they meet at least U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 standards for units that operate solely as an emergency or standby unit for power outages beyond 24 hours.

With more regulation of these energy-intensive data centers needed, NRDC and our partners are ready to push for a data center legislative package in the 2026 Illinois General Assembly, which runs from January through May. Our priorities will be that data centers must bring their own, new clean energy and pay for their own transmission system build-out—ensuring that associated costs aren’t on the backs of consumers and we preserve grid reliability for everyone.

LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) – China’s Changan will launch vehicles from its electric Avatr and Nevo brands in Europe over the next two years and is considering selling light commercial vehicles on the continent as well, the automaker’s global design chief said on Thursday.

So far Changan has focused on launching fully-electric models in Europe. But the company could also sell hybrids and plug-in hybrids under the Changan brand if there is sufficient demand, Klaus Zyciora, vice president and global head of design, told Reuters during an interview in London.

“We will test the water with consumers and see how competitive our offers can be,” Zyciora said. “But there will be a lot of products coming in the near future.”

Changan said in March it planned to start sales in 10 European markets this year. So far it has launched its Deepal S07 electric SUV, which will be joined by the smaller Deepal 05 EV early next year.

The company plans to build a European factory to support sales on the continent. If Changan produced EVs in Europe, it would avoid European Union tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars.

Chongqing-based Changan joins a growing number of Chinese automakers in Europe, including China’s No. 1 car company BYD and the country’s top exporter Chery, plus EV makers Xpeng and Zeekr.

Avatr is a premium Changan electric brand, while Nevo runs from small cars to SUVs.

Europe’s car industry and Germany’s government have urged the European Commission to allow “range extender” EVs (REEVs) – where a backup combustion engine charges the EV battery – in the transition to electric.

With the Legislature creating a sales and use tax exemption for data centers in 2024, more facilities are aiming to set up shop in Michigan.
As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?
Data centers often have gas generators on site to ensure they have enough energy, which creates air pollution, Green explained.
So they really don’t need that many employees.” In reality it’s the construction that brings economic development, not the data centers, Balch said.","Inquisitive residents packed into the Rod Bushey Performing Arts Center at Howell High School Wednesday night, as a panel of environmental, tech and infrastructure experts aimed to provide additional information on what it looks like when a data center is built within a community.

Howell Township is one of a growing number of communities in Michigan raising questions on how they will be impacted if one of these facilities is built within their community as a project reportedly backed by Meta, the parent company for Facebook and Instagram, is planned on more than 1,000 acres of farmland.

Data centers are facilities made to house information technology equipment including servers, storage systems, networking equipment and other hardware used to store and distribute data. While these facilities provide the infrastructure for the internet and web-based services, they are also used in artificial intelligence development.

With the Legislature creating a sales and use tax exemption for data centers in 2024, more facilities are aiming to set up shop in Michigan. However, the speakers at Wednesday’s community information and action night warned that these projects can herald higher energy rates, alongside a number of environmental issues.

As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?

Ben Green, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information and the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, explained that using programs like ChatGPT or video generation platforms requires a huge amount of energy, increasing energy demand and requiring upgrades to the grid, prompting energy companies to try and recover costs by raising rates.

Oftentimes these companies are realizing they need to keep fossil fuel plants open in order to supply energy to these resource intensive facilities, Green said, which can scuttle climate goals like Michigan’s law requiring energy companies to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.

Data centers often have gas generators on site to ensure they have enough energy, which creates air pollution, Green explained. Data centers can also create issues with light pollution and noise pollution, Green said.

Water use is another major concern, Green said, explaining that water is often the most effective way to cool servers and chips, which generate heat when in use.

Transparency is also a major issue surrounding these facilities, Green said.

“Data Center companies are incredibly eager to not share any information about how much electricity they use, how much water they use,” Green said. “Often they have various types of non-disclosure agreements or kind of bans on what even the public officials are allowed to say. So it can be very hard for journalists and citizens to actually learn, you know, just how much electricity are you using, how much water are you using?”

While data centers are often viewed as a major job creator, Green and Prescott Balch, a retired tech industry employee who wrote software supported by data centers, said the actual gains are significantly smaller compared to what companies promise.

“There’s a lot of construction work in these projects,” Balch said. “The construction work will employ over 1,000 people at its peak, and it will last for quite a while.”

However, the data centers themselves employ as few people as possible by design, Balch said. Both Green and Balch noted that the facilities often only have around 20 to 25 full time employees after it is built.

“It’s not, you know, what you might envision of a San Francisco office of coders and developers and program managers,” Green said. “It’s really just a bunch of a stack of computers on computers, on computers just processing data. So they really don’t need that many employees.”

In reality it’s the construction that brings economic development, not the data centers, Balch said. They do not turn communities into tech hubs, Balch said, calling them “the broom closet of technology.”

“We need them. You got to put the broom someplace,” Balch said. “They’re really important, and they’re really large. They can’t go in expensive real estate in downtown San Francisco. But they’re not sexy.”

Balch also warned that the AI boom driving investment into these facilities could go bust.

“The current data center market is $350 billion,” Balch said. “The currently proposed aggregate of all data center proposals is $2.5 trillion. There is no industry that grows that fast and lives to tell about it.”

Communities entertaining housing a data center need to ask themselves what will happen should the AI bubble burst, Balch said, with the answer varying depending on where they are in the development process.

At the very end of that process, there is a risk of obsolescence, with Balch noting there are very few data centers that are more than 25 years old.

“Technology will relentlessly innovate, and at some point a data center is too expensive to upgrade and it has to get converted to some other use,” Balch said. “We have no track record on hyper scale data centers, because they’re brand new.”

While the details will vary by state and by community, Balch also raised questions about providing these facilities with tax breaks, as they often fail to provide benefits in return.

Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, and Green also noted that the tax revenue that is lost in providing these breaks could instead be used for other priorities like schools, public services or roads.

Balch also noted that many of these companies are pursuing sites in small towns with cheap land and close access to water and power. This creates an additional risk for residents, who will be left to make up for lost tax revenue if a data center dries up.

While they can drive economic development, the key is to develop a lot of them, Balch said.

If a community has the expertise and expenses to negotiate a fair deal with the company, the resources needed to manage these oversized projects and a tax base that can absorb the cost if a facility becomes obsolete, then a data center could work there, Balch said, emphasizing that there are pros and cons to every project.

When asked how members of the community can protect themselves from the financial and environmental risks of a project, Balch encouraged them to tally up those downsides, decide which ones are important to them, and to formulate a strategy from there on how those issues can be addressed.

Pierce recommended residents call their lawmakers and ask them to repeal the law creating tax breaks for data centers, and to take steps to hold their state and local officials accountable.

Green emphasized that data center developers and tech companies push for these projects to move forward as quickly as possible with as little transparency as possible, advising community members to do everything in their power to slow the process down and learn more.

“It’s imperative to figure out, like, who you know, is it the zoning board? Who is it in this community that actually has the sign off to approve or disapprove this project?” Green said. “What can you do, whether it’s a ballot initiative or something else, to put a moratorium in place, to just say we need to gather more information before a decision is made.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7275-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:05:26.434572

Aligns with Duke Energy's focus to reduce costs while supporting reliability and economic prosperity

Federal cost-share project will support small modular reactor deployment by Tennessee Valley Authority and GE Vernova Hitachi

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy reaffirms its commitment to advanced nuclear development activities as part of its participation in a recently announced U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) cost-share project.

Earlier this week, the DOE announced a $400 million grant to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to continue to accelerate deployment of GE Vernova Hitachi's (GVH) BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) technology. As previously announced, Duke Energy's participation in TVA's technology grant application supports the company's new nuclear strategy by joining with other utilities and technology providers to more cost effectively advance a standard technology design, while leveraging lessons learned from the industry. The collaboration aligns with Duke Energy's long-term strategy to deliver reliable, affordable, and carbon-free energy to its customers while supporting American prosperity and energy dominance.

""Public-private partnerships accelerate technology development and reduce costs and risks for customers and investors,"" said Harry Sideris, Duke Energy president and chief executive officer. ""Our work with TVA and GE Vernova Hitachi will advance the BWRX-300, paving the way for future deployment of SMRs that strengthen grid reliability and support economic growth.""

As part of Duke Energy's diverse energy mix, SMRs can play a vital role in strengthening economic prosperity while maintaining reliability at the lowest possible cost for customers. Collaboration with TVA and GVH supports the company's near-term activities to rigorously evaluate and partner with industry stakeholders to advance new nuclear generation. This includes potential SMR deployment at the Belews Creek site in North Carolina where the company plans to submit an early site permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by year-end.

More information about the grant and the project teams can be found on the Department of Energy website.

And it is on pace to grow plastic production by more than 50% by 2040 — twice the expected increase in waste management capacity over the same period.
The science is mounting on the potential harm from microplastics and the thousands of chemicals that are used in plastic production.
However, there is a path to a healthier and cleaner future — a path that transforms the plastic system.
Putting an end to plastic pollution is a logical choice for our environment, for our health and for our economies.","Within 15 years, a garbage truck’s worth of plastic could be entering our environment every second. Not every minute. Every second. Plastic is everywhere in modern life and has essential, lifesaving uses, but the proliferation of plastic has also made it one of the great environmental challenges of our time. Plastic pollutes our land, air and water; costs governments billions each year to manage; and is putting human health at increasing risk.

On the current trajectory, the consequences of plastic pollution are far worse than we understood even five years ago. The latest findings by the Pew Charitable Trusts are sobering, but they also chart a clear path forward using solutions that already exist.

The world already creates more plastic than can be effectively managed. And it is on pace to grow plastic production by more than 50% by 2040 — twice the expected increase in waste management capacity over the same period. This means that despite more than $32 billion in additional investment in waste management capacity, plastic production will continue to grow faster than the infrastructure being built to manage it.

And these costs come not just in dollars and cents but also through various health threats linked to plastics — including cancer, heart disease, asthma, decreased fertility and developmental issues. Microplastics have been found throughout people’s bodies, including in placentas alongside fetuses.

The science is mounting on the potential harm from microplastics and the thousands of chemicals that are used in plastic production. Currently, 6 million years of healthy life is being lost each year due to illness, disability or premature death associated with plastic production and waste. These health risks stem primarily from air pollution caused by production facilities or the burning of plastic waste in places that lack the capacity to properly manage it. By 2040, nearly 10 million years of healthy life will be lost per year — and that’s before accounting for any health impacts from the use of plastic products.

However, there is a path to a healthier and cleaner future — a path that transforms the plastic system. With the solutions available today, plastic pollution can be cut by 83% by 2040 and almost eliminated from one of its leading causes: packaging. To that end, governments and companies need to deploy solutions throughout the global plastic system. These solutions’ effectiveness depends on transforming the plastic system by reducing production, improving product and system design, enhancing waste management, and increasing the transparency of the supply chain and its impacts.

This path will require unprecedented collaboration among policymakers, businesses, innovators and communities, and the benefits will be immense. If we commit to this collaboration, in the next 15 years, health impacts will be halved, governments will save billions annually on waste management, and new business opportunities and millions of new jobs — with better pay and better working conditions — will be created as the landscape of jobs shifts from plastic production to collection, recycling and reuse and the creation of substitute materials.

The urgency is real. If we delay action another five years, even more plastic will end up in our air, land and water. This delay would result in billions more being invested in “linear economy” infrastructure — in which products are made, used and thrown away. Instead, those investments could go toward building a “circular economy” — in which materials are reused, recycled or repurposed, keeping them in use for as long as possible and reducing waste.

It’s time for New York to pass a Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act and give every student, from kindergarten through college, a safe, modern and sustainable place to learn.","Many school and university buildings are too old for the energy transition. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act would help districts make upgrades.

New York’s students walk into school buildings every morning with big dreams. But too many of those buildings across every region of the state are simply not built for the realities of today — or the climate of tomorrow.

If we’re serious about student health, academic success and meeting New York’s clean-energy goals, we need a statewide investment that matches the scope of the challenge. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act is that investment.

According to state facilities data, the average school building in New York was already over 50 years old as of 2005. Many were constructed in the 1950s through the 1970s, long before modern ventilation standards, reliable cooling or energy-efficient design. National data tells a similar story: The average U.S. instructional school building is now 49 years old, with 38% built before 1970.

When buildings are this old, they weren’t designed for the electrical loads needed for solar power, clean-energy systems or modern filtration. We are asking mid-20th-century facilities to meet 21st-century climate and learning demands. It will not work without major capital investment.

Clean air, stable temperatures and reliable heating and cooling are not luxuries; they are basic conditions for learning. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act would allow districts to make the kinds of long-term energy and health upgrades students and educators desperately need: modern ventilation, healthier air, updated heating and cooling, new electrical systems, solar power installations and the infrastructure required for electric school buses.

Solar is especially powerful. Schools are among the most effective sites in New York for solar energy generation, dramatically reducing operating costs and freeing up local funds for classrooms and student support.

Our public colleges face the same pressures. SUNY’s 2,800 buildings carry a deferred maintenance backlog of roughly $10 billion that is growing by $600 million to $700 million each year. A bond act that includes SUNY and CUNY recognizes that climate leadership and educational excellence are inseparable, and that New York’s higher education system cannot prepare the workforce of tomorrow in buildings built for the last century.

School districts and colleges want to modernize their buildings, cut energy use, and install solar; they just cannot shoulder these costs alone. Many lack access to the engineering, planning and technical support needed for comprehensive decarbonization plans. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act would provide grants, capital funding, technical assistance and expert advisers to help districts and campuses, ensuring that high-need and rural communities benefit just as much as wealthier ones.

And every clean-energy upgrade, solar installation, and bus-charging project is a jobs project. A bond act can ensure that the transition to carbon-free schools and campuses strengthens apprenticeship pathways, supports local economies and creates thousands of good union jobs across the state.

Funding for the transition to electric school buses is equally urgent. New York’s mandate for 100% zero-emission buses by 2035 was an ambitious move, but the upfront costs are enormous. A bond act would help districts purchase buses, build charging infrastructure, integrate solar-powered depots and reduce long-term transportation costs. This is about climate — but it is also about the air children breathe every morning and afternoon at the curb in front of their school.

A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act is more than a climate measure. It is an education reform, a public-health strategy, an equity commitment and a statewide jobs program. Our students deserve schools and colleges built for their future. It’s time for New York to pass a Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act and give every student, from kindergarten through college, a safe, modern and sustainable place to learn.",https://www.nysut.org/-/media/images/nysut/news/2025/december/news_120425_cleanenergy.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:04:47.317419

A large landfill in a small Ohio town

Tina and Bill Higgins have lived among forested Appalachian hills in the tiny village of Amsterdam in eastern Ohio for nearly 25 years. As they waited for their dinner at Grammy’s Kitchen, Bill said that a few years after they moved in, the Apex Sanitary Landfill was built about a mile from their house.

“There’s times you just couldn’t even go out in the summertime to enjoy a cookout or anything because the smell was bad,” he said.

They joined a class action lawsuit over the smell.

When a new company, Interstate Waste Services (IWS), bought the landfill in 2020, the Higginses said the smell improved.

But the landfill continued to get bigger. This year, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency increased the amount of waste it’s allowed to receive, to double what it was a decade ago.

What’s arriving there, along with everyday trash: oil and gas drilling waste.

Between 2014 and 2022, the Amsterdam landfill accepted over 3 million tons of solid waste from the oil and gas industry, according to state records.

During that time, a total of more than 7.3 million tons were sent to eight landfills in Ohio. That waste can include the ground rock and soil, called drill cuttings, that come to the surface after a well is drilled deep into the ground. It could also have things like filter socks, sludges from the bottom of tanks, and buildup from inside pipes.

“We don’t know…,” Tina Higgins said. “Yeah, we didn’t even know about that,” Bill Higgins finished her sentence.

(Lack of) tracking of solid drilling waste

Folks here can be forgiven for not knowing the local landfill was taking frack waste. Ohio regulators aren’t tracking it anymore, either.

“Since 2023, facilities are no longer required to report shale drilling waste separately in their annual reports,” said Ohio EPA spokesperson Max Moore in an email, though “some still opt to do so.”

Moore said this reporting requirement, which started with the shale boom, was discontinued because “the data was not consistent.”

Landfills also are not required to track the origin of shale drilling waste they receive; it could be from a well pad in Ohio, Pennsylvania or elsewhere.

“This is the perpetual problem; we don’t know,” said Melissa Troutman, who wrote an analysis of Pennsylvania’s oil and gas waste policy for the non-profit group Earthworks in 2019.

In Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Protection requires drillers to report where they are sending their waste.

For example, Pennsylvania drillers reported sending more than 107,000 tons of oil and gas waste to the IWS landfill in Amsterdam last year, according to an analysis of DEP records by Inside Climate News. Overall, more than 130,000 tons of Pennsylvania drilling waste went to landfills in Ohio last year.

But even in Pennsylvania, it’s hard to tell where much of it is being sent, “because regulatory agencies are not tracking shale gas waste going to landfills adequately,” Troutman said.

And that worries environmental advocates.

According to the U.S. EPA, solid waste from shale formations, like the Marcellus and Utica regions of Pennsylvania and Ohio, can contain salts, heavy metals like cadmium, volatile organic compounds such as cancer-causing benzene and radioactive materials like radium.

But the U.S. EPA doesn’t regulate it as “hazardous” waste.

As early as the 1970s, the oil and gas industry lobbied for an exemption from federal hazardous waste regulations to avoid higher disposal costs. In 1980, Congress included a temporary exemption in a federal solid waste law, and in 1988, the EPA determined that designating the waste as hazardous was not warranted, a finding it repeated in 2019.

So, there’s a patchwork of state regulations when it comes to tracking and monitoring it.

In Pennsylvania, trucks carrying waste, including from the oil and gas industry, are monitored for radioactivity before entering landfills.

In Ohio, some drilling waste, such as filter socks, sludges and scale from pipes, is required to be tested for radioactivity before it can be sent to a landfill. These are considered TENORM in Ohio – waste that is “technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material.”

Tests must show radium-226 and radium-228 concentrations at less than 5 picocuries per gram above natural background levels.

Ohio exempts much solid oil and gas waste from radiological testing

But drill cuttings, which make up much of the solid waste from fracking, are not defined as TENORM in Ohio.

“Drill cuttings are considered naturally occurring radioactive material (not TENORM) and do not require radium testing for disposal in Ohio’s solid waste landfills,” said Ohio EPA spokesperson Bryant Somerville in an email.

Earthjustice attorney Megan Hunter, who has researched oil and gas waste regulations in numerous states, doesn’t think drill cuttings should be exempt from those tests, because it’s all radiation going into the landfill.

“I don’t see the distinction as particularly relevant in terms of when you’re talking about human health and risks to the environment,” she said.

How waste moves from the landfills to the waterways

One of those risks is contamination of waterways.

When it rains on a landfill, like the one in Amsterdam, water runs through all the household trash, construction debris and drilling waste.

“It’s sitting there like a tea bag, and every time it rains and things soak through, it creates this product called leachate because things are leaching,” and picking up pollutants, explained Duquesne University professor John Stolz, who has been studying the issue.

Ohio landfills collect leachate, which must be treated before being discharged into waterways.

Stolz looked over the latest leachate testing report for the Amsterdam landfill. He said if the state wants to monitor for contamination from drilling waste, landfills should measure for radium and other indicators of oil and gas waste.

“They should be measuring lithium, they should be measuring bromide and strontium,” Stolz said. If test results showed elevated levels, it would indicate that oil and gas waste was contaminating the leachate. “Why [else] would there be strontium in the leachate for a sanitary landfill? I mean, there’s not a lot of strontium in dirty diapers,” he said.

IWS said in an email that its Amsterdam landfill adheres to state regulations along with its “Waste Acceptance Plan.”

In Ohio, most leachate is sent to municipal sewage plants for treatment. IWS sends much of its leachate more than an hour’s drive north to the city of Alliance’s sewage treatment plant.

In an email, the plant operator said its biological organisms used for treatment have been consuming pollutants from Amsterdam and other landfills for decades. Last year, the sewage plant treated more than 60 million gallons of leachate from four landfills that accept oil and gas waste, according to the landfills’ annual reports.

But the sewage plant is not testing for radioactivity; it’s not required in the permit that allows it to discharge treated wastewater into a creek of the Mahoning River, a tributary of the Ohio River.

Stolz is concerned that regulators aren’t tracking or testing much of the drilling waste anywhere in the process.

“Neither the landfill or the waste treatment plant have to monitor things that we feel are important to monitor,” Stolz said. “Because they are going to be a problem downstream, literally and figuratively, over time.”

He points to one sewage plant near Pittsburgh where leachate loaded with frack waste pollutants was blamed for knocking out the treatment process. It ended up sending contaminated wastewater into the Monongahela River.

Stolz’s biggest concern is that radiation will wind up in the waterways.

A study by his team and researchers at the University of Pittsburgh backs this up. They found radioactivity in river sediments downstream of numerous sewage plants that treat leachate from landfills that accept frack waste.

“We did find a statistically significant higher amount of radioactivity downstream than upstream,” Stolz said, “and water chemistries that suggested or were indicative of discharge from oil and gas.”

A call for consistency in state regulations

This kind of evidence has prompted environmental groups and radiation safety experts to call for consistent regulation of oil and gas waste.

“It varies largely from state to state,” said William Kennedy, scientific vice president with the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. He’s written about this issue and points out one potential problem when neighboring states have differing rules, such as when Pennsylvania requires that drill cuttings be tested for radioactivity before being landfilled, while Ohio does not.

“If you had a producer…and they found a particular regulation in one state onerous or difficult to comply with, what would keep them from shipping it to another state for disposal under a different set of regulations?” he asked.

Kennedy said he and his co-authors wanted to start a dialogue among state regulators to move past the current piecemeal approach.

“So people could think through this entire problem and come up with a regulatory scheme that made sense, that would be sort of universal, that the states could adopt,” he said.

Amy Mall, who authored a report on inconsistencies in state regulations for the Natural Resources Defense Council, wants federal rules for the disposal of frack waste, such as drill cuttings, so the government can require it to be tracked and tested.

“And if they’re not regulated, they’re exempt from regulations – they’re not doing any of those things,” Mall said. “And so the public doesn’t know where this waste is going or how dangerous it is.”

A new effort in Washington seeks to change that. Congressional Democrats introduced a series of bills in the House to regulate frack waste, including one called “Closing Loopholes and Ending Arbitrary and Needless Evasion of Regulations Act of 2025.’’ It includes a long-shot bid to define the waste as hazardous. So far, only one lawmaker from Pennsylvania and one from Ohio have signed on.

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency this week signed off on a cleanup plan for the old U.S. Steel South Works at 8080 S. DuSable Lake Shore Drive. Developers Related Midwest and CRG are pursuing updated approvals that would clear the site as safe for redevelopment.

The Quantum Shore project will include the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, a replacement for Advocate Trinity Hospital, single-family housing and improved access to South Chicago’s lakefront parks, officials have said. The development broke ground Sept. 30.

The site was remediated under U.S. Steel’s ownership, and it has received “no further remediation” letters in the decades since the South Works’ closure. Illinois environmental regulators issue such letters to confirm site conditions “do not present a significant risk to human health or the environment.”

Most of the property needs no further remediation, as the state previously determined, developers said last month. However, recent soil and water testing found pollutants like petroleum, heavy metals and man-made chemicals from the steel mill’s operations.

State regulators on Monday approved a plan to clean up those pollutants, which was drafted for the developers by Little Village-based Pioneer Engineering and Environmental Services.

With the conditional approval in hand, and with no further approvals needed, remediation and construction work will begin this month, the developers said.

“Leveraging our decades of experience with complex environmental projects, we remain committed to meeting all reporting requirements and regulatory standards … to address legacy contamination and to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” Related Midwest spokesperson Matt Baker said in a statement.

A major aspect of the remediation plan would enclose contaminants within a massive barrier system. A horizontal barrier of asphalt, concrete or clean soil would cover the entire Quantum Shore site, while nearly 2 miles of “slurry walls” would prevent pollution from leaking into Lake Michigan or the Calumet River, according to the plan.

The state’s approval requires the developers to meet a series of conditions as they carry out the plan and work toward updated “no further remediation” letters. The conditions include:

Monitoring the slurry wall system’s effectiveness for at least 30 years.

Remediating groundwater near a well which showed elevated levels of vinyl chloride.

Addressing an additional soil sample which was determined to be hazardous and corrosive.

Either developing systems to mitigate the risk of vapor inhalation, or performing additional testing to determine such systems are not needed, once the specific locations of buildings on the premises are finalized.

The full report and remediation plan is available through the agency’s website.

While most of the property needs no further remediation, as the state previously determined, about 6.5 percent of the site is polluted beyond modern cleanup standards, the developers said last month.

Residents remain concerned about unearthing slag, contaminated soil and other byproducts of the steelmaking process during construction. Neighbors have also sounded the alarm about the possible effects of transporting pollution from the site during its cleanup, like heavy truck traffic and escaped dust.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. solicitor general on Monday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to deny Duke Energy’s appeal challenging a lower court’s ruling in an antitrust lawsuit brought by independent power producer NTE Energy.

In August 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit properly ruled that NTE Carolina’s antitrust suit against Duke could move ahead after it was dismissed by a lower court, according to U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer.

“This appeal arises out of a campaign by an established monopolist to stop a more efficient rival from disturbing its long-dominant hold over a regional energy market,” Sauer said. “Without ever competing with [NTE] on the merits (i.e., offering a better service), [Duke] was able to prevent [NTE] from operating its superior [generating] facility.”

Dive Insight:

In the last decade or so, the Department of Justice and private plaintiffs have been reluctant to use antitrust laws to challenge utilities, but that could change based on Sauer’s brief, according to Joshua Macey, a Yale Law School associate professor.

“At the very least, this suggests that the Trump Solicitor General’s Office thinks that antitrust should be a viable tool in electricity markets, and it may indicate that the administration is concerned with anticompetitive conduct,” Macey said in an interview Thursday.

The solicitor general’s stance in the brief makes it less likely the Supreme Court will take up Duke’s appeal, according to Macey.

The action at the Supreme Court centers on a long-running dispute between Duke’s vertically-integrated North Carolina subsidiary and NTE that led to anticompetitive claims by the power producer against the utility company.

Duke Energy Carolinas in November 2017 entered into a large generator interconnection agreement with NTE Carolinas II, which planned to build a combined-cycle gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, N.C.

Two years later, Duke Energy Carolinas sued NTE for breach of contract, alleging that the independent power producer failed to make payments required under the interconnection agreement. In June 2022, a district court dismissed NTE’s claims that Duke Energy Carolinas engaged in illegal, anticompetitive behavior.

However, the Fourth Circuit appeals court reversed the district court’s decision, finding that Duke took various steps that in combination could be considered anticompetitive, according to Sauer.

“When a monopolist engages in a coordinated campaign to squelch competition, no circuit holds that each discrete aspect of the defendant’s conduct must be analyzed in isolation,” Sauer said. “Instead, courts uniformly agree, consistent with this Court’s precedent, that a holistic analysis is appropriate in circumstances like these.”

In its petition asking the Supreme Court to review the appeals court’s decision, Duke said each action it took in relation to the planned NTE power plant was legal.

The appeals court embraced a “monopoly broth” theory that a set of legal actions can be deemed anticompetitive, according to Duke.

“If an antitrust plaintiff pleads a series of independently lawful acts, each of which does not violate this Court’s precedents, those acts cannot together add up to some nebulous antitrust violation,” Duke said in its petition.

NTE’s plans to build its power plant hinged on landing an offtake agreement with the city of Fayetteville, N.C., according to court documents. Duke undercut that option by restructuring Fayetteville’s supply contract with the utility — which had produced $100 million in annual revenue for Duke — to give it a short-term discount and lump-sum payment, Sauer said.

Duke also agreed to quadruple the price it paid for excess power from a Fayetteville power plant — a price increase worth $283 million, according to Sauer.

In total, Duke gave Fayetteville a $325 million incentive, which it intended to recoup through future price increases on Fayetteville and other customers, he said.

At the same time, Duke sought to “hobble and discredit” NTE, in part by sending two notices of default on NTE’s interconnection agreement and falsely claiming that NTE failed to pay its invoices, Sauer said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/8gYmeq4gKkxP2qNRbWaARkqCDyGBoWjHqnxCVeO_Sag/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Bc2hldmlsbGVfQ29tYmluZWRfQ3ljbGVfU3RhdGlvbl9FeHRlcmlvcl8xX2RxSk92V1ouanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-04 13:06:01.619812

“Coal fired power plants nearly destroyed the Adirondack Park’s forests, lakes and ponds with acid rain,” said Adirondack Council Clean Air Specialist and Director of Communications John F. Sheehan. “Things are starting to get better here after 30 years of pollution reductions. We don’t want to undo this win and once again lose trees and fish.”

“The 2024 soot standards were 25% better at protecting public health than the old standard, which now goes back into effect,” Sheehan said. “Rolling back National Ambient Air Quality Standards undermines public health and safety and will have lasting economic impacts for the country. The nation saves $20 in public health costs for every dollar spent cutting air pollution such as soot, ozone and sulfur dioxide.”

The executive order issued on Nov. 21 proclaimed that steel makers would be exempt from Biden-era standards that were designed to prevent future pollution increases at all coal-fired smokestacks. All of the steel plants exempted were already meeting the new standards.

The EPA filed a motion in the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, saying it doesn’t intend to enforce the updated national soot standards. In 2024, the EPA reduced the allowable levels of soot 2.5 microns and larger from 12 micrograms per liter to 9. Several states and industries sued the EPA to overturn the rule. Instead, the EPA said it would stop enforcing it.

Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit.

The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities.

“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?”

The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs.

Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.

The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.

In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas.

The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January.

Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document.

The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”

Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.

“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.

The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks.

“They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is. It’s not here.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/12/43.-LNG-tanker-Cameron-Parish-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:06:16.768059

In previous PERTE funding rounds, Spain has already disbursed over €3 billion, attracting numerous major projects.","Spain is restructuring its EV incentives around three pillars and redefining responsibilities in the process. Central to this shift is the ‘Plan Auto+’ programme, which will allocate €400 million in direct subsidies to consumers in 2026, aimed at reducing car prices. These grants will be managed by the central government, unlike the Moves III incentive scheme, which expires at the end of 2025 and was administered by the autonomous regions. ‘Plan Auto+’ will replace the Moves programme at the turn of the year.

The new 2030 plan also includes a programme called ‘Moves Corredores’, with a budget of €300 million dedicated to installing charging stations. An additional €580 million will be allocated in 2026 to the existing PERTE eMobility incentive programme, which supports projects in electric vehicle and battery production. The latter is classified as industrial subsidies.

‘Cars built here, affordable for Spaniards”

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has emphasised that the ‘España Auto 2030’ plan is the result of a public-private partnership, supporting both supply and demand. It introduces ‘significantly more business-friendly regulations for the sector,’ accompanied by incentives to boost production and sales. During the roadmap’s presentation, Sánchez stated: “We are here today so that Spain can produce electric cars that are as competitive as our capabilities allow—and affordable for Spaniards.” He added: “The electrification of the automobile is here to stay. The goal is for everyone to benefit.”

Spain’s automotive industry contributes nearly 10% to the country’s GDP and supports almost two million direct and indirect jobs. This makes Spain the second-largest car manufacturer in Europe. However, in terms of electrification, the country has been relatively slow, as highlighted by the portal Forocoches Electricos: “Although the Moves III programme has enabled the purchase of 170,000 electric cars, with numbers set to double again in 2025, the starting point remains low. Two major obstacles persist: the limited number of charging stations and cumbersome bureaucracy, which hinders expansion.”

Previous incentive scheme had structural weaknesses

The Spanish government launched Moves III in 2021 and topped up by €400 million in December 2022, bringing its total budget to €1.2 billion. With further top-ups in 2024 (€1.55 billion) and 2025 (€400 million), the funds allocated to Moves III have grown to €1.735 billion over the years. However, the programme suffered from structural weaknesses, with some applicants waiting up to two years to receive their incentives. Disbursement was handled by the autonomous regions. The government had intended to reform the system last year but was delayed due to the country’s devastating floods.

The time for reform is finally here: Sánchez views the overhaul as a plan of national significance, aimed at ensuring ‘Spain has done its homework by the end of the decade.’ The measures are the result of closer collaboration and dialogue with the private sector. However, not all details have been finalised. For instance, it remains unclear whether the purchase grants will be paid directly at the dealership or through a central authority. No information has been provided about the amount of the grants either. Additionally, as Forocoches Electricos points out: “It is also unclear what will happen to the thousands of car owners who purchased vehicles under MOVES III but have yet to receive their funds.” These details will be clarified once the final guidelines are published.

Sánchez firmly commits to e-mobility

Madrid has made it clear that the cost of electric vehicles must decrease to make the transition to e-mobility truly attractive in Spain. “We want to produce electric cars in Spain that are affordable for our country’s middle and working classes—and ensure these groups are not excluded from the Green Deal,” Sánchez explained. Currently, purchasing an electric car represents a significant financial burden for many families. The government must thus act transparently and decisively to support this process. The Prime Minister reiterated: “Spain will not waver in its commitment to electric mobility.”

Economic interests also play a major role: Spain is the production hub for Volkswagen Group’s upcoming family of electric compact cars. Sánchez sees this as a significant opportunity for both industry and consumers: “Next year, we will see a range of electric models priced under €25,000. This is the path to the future, and the Spanish government aims to walk it together with industry.”

Proven distribution system after the floods

In 2026, the Auto+ plan will provide the aforementioned €400 million in direct purchase subsidies for electric vehicles. This annual budget aligns with previous Moves funding levels. However, by centralising programme administration, the government aims to ensure a faster and more uniform process. The goal is to ‘ensure that payments reach families when they need them,’ according to officials. The model is based on the ‘Reinicia Auto+’ plan, introduced to mitigate the impacts of the flood disaster, which, according to the government, helped ‘95% of applications from Valencia residents’ to be processed within a year of the tragedy.

The second pillar of Spain’s 2030 roadmap focuses on infrastructure. In 2026, a new programme called ‘Moves Corredores’ will launch with a budget of €300 million. It remains unclear whether this sum is intended solely for 2026 or beyond, as the duration of the programme has not been specified. The initiative will fund chargers in so-called ‘shadow zones’—road sections where necessary charging stations are still lacking, as the government has stated. Additionally, Madrid plans to ‘drastically reduce’ the licences and permits required for installing charging stations and will establish a centralised website for charging infrastructure. To date, the government has supported the expansion of charging infrastructure in Spain with a total of €600 million through various programmes (Moves III, Moves Fleets, and Moves Singulares).

Over half a billion euros in industry support

The third component of the government’s plan is another funding round under the PERTE programme—an industrial aid scheme aimed at boosting innovation and competitiveness in the e-mobility and battery sectors. An additional €580 million will be made available for 2026. “The focus is now on becoming a leader in battery manufacturing and recycling, and transforming the entire value chain: from design to large assembly plants, including SMEs that ensure component supply,” Sánchez told the industry. In previous PERTE funding rounds, Spain has already disbursed over €3 billion, attracting numerous major projects.

When Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her directive for the New York Power Authority to develop a new, zero-emission advanced nuclear facility in Upstate New York, she issued a challenge worthy of this moment: Build the next generation of clean, reliable power right here at home.

Now, the question is: Where should it be built? The answer is clear: Oswego.

For decades, Oswego County has been the heart of New York’s nuclear energy industry. On the shores of Lake Ontario, the FitzPatrick and Nine Mile Point plants have quietly powered millions of homes with carbon-free energy. These aren’t just facilities — they are pillars of our community. They have supported families for generations, sustained small businesses and regional economic development, as well as created pathways to good-paying, union jobs.

At the center of that success is Constellation Energy, one of the nation’s leading nuclear operators. Constellation runs both Oswego plants and has set the standard for safety, innovation and reliability. Their commitment to union labor ensures that these jobs stay local, skilled and secure. When people talk about the best of American energy leadership, they’re often describing what’s already happening right here in Central New York.

That’s why this community is uniquely ready to host New York’s first advanced nuclear project. The infrastructure is in place. The transmission capacity exists. The workforce is trained, and just as importantly, the public understands and supports nuclear energy because they’ve lived with it safely for generations. There is no better example of how collaboration between industry, labor and community can deliver real results.

Advanced nuclear technology is essential to meeting New York’s ambitious clean energy goals. Wind and solar are critical, but to keep our grid stable and our economy growing, we also need zero-emission power that’s available around the clock. That’s what advanced nuclear provides and it’s what Oswego already does best.

Building this facility here would bring thousands of union construction jobs and hundreds of permanent, family-sustaining positions. It would expand opportunities for local schools, colleges and training programs, and it would strengthen the regional economy for decades to come. Just as importantly, it would reaffirm something Oswego has always known: that clean energy and good jobs go hand in hand.

This moment is about more than power generation — it’s about leadership. It’s about showing that Oswego can continue to lead the nation in clean energy innovation. With Constellation’s proven expertise, our unions’ unmatched skill, and the deep community pride that defines this region, Oswego isn’t just ready for the next era of nuclear energy — it’s built for it.

Gov. Hochul has made a call for the first new nuclear power in a generation, producing at least one gigawatt of clean energy to enhance grid reliability and meet state climate goals. Oswego is ready to answer that call and power New York’s next great energy chapter.",https://www.nysenate.gov/themes/custom/nysenate_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-04 15:01:51.397066

Viet Nam is a remarkable development success story. Economic reforms since the launch of Đổi Mới in 1986, coupled with favorable global trends, helped transform Viet Nam from one of the world’s poorest countries to a dynamic middle-income economy in a single generation. The transformation over the past four decades has brought tangible improvements in people’s lives, lifting millions out of poverty, expanding access to health care and education, and connecting nearly all households to essential infrastructure.

Infant mortality fell from 32.6 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 12.1 in 2023, and life expectancy rose from 70.5 years in 1990 to 74.5 years in 2023. Access to health care expanded, with 93 percent of the population covered by national health insurance in 2023.

Viet Nam achieved universal primary education in the early 2000s. In 2024, net enrollment reached 95 percent for lower-secondary and 80 percent for upper-secondary school. Viet Nam’s learning-adjusted years of schooling average 10.2 years—the second highest in ASEAN—and its human capital index is the highest among lower-middle-income countries.

By 2019, nearly all households in Viet Nam had electricity, up from just 14 percent in 1993. Rural access to clean water rose from 17 percent to 51 percent over the same period. Investments continue in sanitation, transport, and digital connectivity.

By 2045, Viet Nam aspires to become a high-income country while achieving inclusive and green growth. At the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27), held in 2022, it pledged to cut methane emissions by 30 percent and halt deforestation by 2030 and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Looking ahead, Viet Nam faces rising challenges, including an aging population, global trade shifts, rapid automation, and climate risks. Strengthening institutions and improving policy implementation—especially in climate resilience, social protection, and digital transformation—will be key to sustaining progress and achieving the country’s long-term goals.

Vice President & General Manager of 300mm fab in Singapore, GlobalFoundries

Every semiconductor chip begins its life in a fab. While chips are essential for powering today’s digital age and enabling advancements in AI, their production consumes significant amounts of energy and generates greenhouse gases (GHG) as a by-product.

As we work toward our Journey to Zero Carbon goals, GF remains committed to environmentally responsible manufacturing and operations, continually taking action to reduce and manage our greenhouse gas emissions.

With a mix of innovation, smart engineering and bold improvements, our teams seek to decarbonize semiconductor manufacturing to further reduce GF’s carbon footprint and deliver on our sustainability commitments to our customers.

We are currently scaling-up the full deployment of a central abatement system at our 300-mm fabrication plant in Singapore. Targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2026, this initiative is expected to significantly reduce emissions, enhance resource efficiency and optimize manufacturing processes.

Rethinking abatement

Unlike conventional point-of-use abatement systems that collect and treat exhaust gases from each wafer fabrication tool, multiple tools are connected to a single centralized abatement system that treats exhaust gases in bulk through a multi-stage process.

Here’s how it works:

First, exhaust gases pass through a pre-scrubber where water and an electrostatic precipitator remove acid gases and particles.

The gases are then heated and treated in a catalytic unit which breaks down fluorinated greenhouse gases into water-soluble by-products.

Finally, the by-products go through a post-scrubber for cleaning before being safely vented and the resulting wastewater is sent for further treatment.

Watch the video which illustrates how the system works.

Smarter, cleaner and greener

We achieved encouraging results from a successful pilot of the system, which together with other existing initiatives, has contributed to a substantial reduction in GF Singapore’s emissions.

Moreover, the central abatement system also uses 20% less space and has lower electricity consumption than if conventional point-of-use systems had been employed. It also enhances manufacturing efficiency by minimizing tool downtime and freeing up valuable fab space for production and support operations.

As we prepare to unlock the full potential of the system at the World Economic Forum Global Lighthouse Network-designated fab, our 200 mm and 300 mm facilities in Singapore are driving impactful initiatives aligned with GF’s decarbonization roadmap.

These include replacing traditional chamber-cleaning processes with cleaner, more efficient methods – achieving a 97% reduction in carbon emissions from the upgraded processes at the 200 mm fab. We use electric heat pumps instead of fossil-fuel combustion boilers in our manufacturing operations.

Looking ahead, GF Singapore plans to leverage renewable energy from Singapore’s first hydrogen-ready, energy-efficient power plant when it becomes operational.

Shaping what’s essential sustainably

Our goal is clear: to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We are accelerating our global GHG-reduction goals, aiming for a 42% cut from 2021 levels by 2030, in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Across GF’s operations in the U.S., Germany and Singapore, we continue to pursue energy-efficiency improvements, alternative chemistries, new green technologies and lower-carbon power sources as part of our ONEGF roadmap.

Decarbonizing a fab isn’t easy. But with innovation, collaboration and the commitment of our people, we’re proving that our essential chips can power a connected world sustainably.

We will vigorously fight this action in court to ensure that the public receives the full — and timely — benefit of the methane rule.""","Washington, DC - Health, environment, and community groups have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the Trump EPA’s rushed and unlawful final rule to delay protections against methane pollution from the oil and gas industry.

The rule would delay implementation of many of the requirements in the 2024 U.S. EPA methane standards – which keep dangerous pollution out of our air and reduce wasted energy from oil and gas leaks, venting and flaring – in spite of widespread community opposition, deep concerns about risks to human health, and a pending lawsuit challenging an Interim Final rule announced by the Trump administration earlier this year that contained identical extensions for many of the same deadlines.

Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a climate pollutant that is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. It is responsible for almost 30% of the global warming that we have experienced so far, and it is helping drive climate change and its worsening floods, wildfires, heatwaves and other severe weather events that are harming people across the country.

The 2024 standards reduce methane pollution through commonsense steps like requiring leak detection and repairs. Those steps also reduce the emissions of other dangerous pollutants, including smog and soot-forming volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants that cause cancer. And, because methane is the primary ingredient of natural gas, failure to address venting, flaring, and leaks led to about $3.5 billion worth of wasted natural gas – 16 million metric tons of methane – in 2023 alone. Both large and independent producers have gone on record in support of federal methane regulation, and major oil and gas producing states including Colorado, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and New Mexico have already been implementing the standards.

In July, Administrator Zeldin announced that he would use the Interim Final Rule process to delay requirements for companies to comply with the methane standards for as long as 18 months – even though the standards had already been in place for more than a year, and even though EPA’s own fact sheet noted the delay would lead to more pollution: “The EPA estimates that the following emissions reductions will not occur from 2028-2038 as a result of the interim final rule: 3.8 million tons of methane, 960,000 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and 36,000 tons of toxic air pollutant.” EPA also offered no opportunity for public input until after the Interim Final Rule delay took effect, in violation of the law.

Thirteen health, environment and community groups – Environmental Defense Fund, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Council, Clean Air Task Force, Dakota Resource Council, Earthjustice, Earthworks, Environmental Law & Policy Center, Food & Water Watch, Fort Berthold Protectors of Water and Earth Rights (Fort Berthold POWER), GreenLatinos, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) and Sierra Club – filed a lawsuit challenging that Interim Final rule. That lawsuit is still pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

Then a week ago, late in the afternoon on the day before Thanksgiving, EPA announced its Final Rule, which also delays implementation of the methane protections by 18 months.

Yesterday, the same day the Final Rule was published in the Federal Register, the same groups filed another lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit challenging it.

Quotes from Petitioners

“In 2023 oil and gas companies wasted enough natural gas to cover all heating and cooking needs at 19 million homes. That’s the equivalent of every home in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The 2024 methane standards are already working to prevent that pointless waste of American energy – while reducing pollution, protecting people’s health, and lowering risks from weather disasters fueled by climate change. Americans deserve cleaner air and less energy waste, but the Trump EPA’s Final Rule rushes us in the opposite direction. We will vigorously oppose this unlawful action.– Rosalie Winn, Senior Director and Lead Counsel of Methane and Clean Air Policy, Environmental Defense Fund

""This illegal delay of the Methane Rule ignores not only the law but the best interests of the People. Methane emission reductions benefit the environment, public health, and even oil and gas industry's profits. Which makes EPA's decision more than arbitrary and capricious, but just plain absurd."" – Lauren E. Otero, Esq., Clean Air Council

""Now is not the time to slow down efforts to reduce pollution. We have long known that quickly and significantly reducing methane emissions is key to avoiding the worst effects of climate change, and we have the tools at our disposal to do so now – all while reducing air pollution that harms communities living and working near oil and gas facilities. Despite the significant increases in methane, VOCs, and other pollutants – and the timelines EPA determined were the best approach last year – the administration has decided to side with polluters at the expense of public health and the climate.” — Mary Sasso, attorney, Clean Air Task Force

“Methane is a climate killer and a public health menace. We’re taking the Trump administration to court because delaying efforts to rein in this super pollutant is unlawful, irresponsible and will harm both people and the planet.” – Jason Rylander, Legal Director, Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute

""The Trump Administration continues to prioritize corporate polluters' bottom lines over peoples' health. This unlawful action cannot stand."" – Alexandra Schluntz, Senior Attorney, Earthjustice

“Instead of protecting the people harmed by oil and gas pollution, the Trump EPA is once again choosing to protect polluters. Delaying methane safeguards means more toxic air, more climate-driven disasters, and more avoidable harm to families living near drilling. Communities deserve timely protections not another giveaway to the oil and gas industry."" – Lauren Pagel, Policy Director, Earthworks

“The Trump EPA’s final methane emissions rule backslides to inaction on wasted energy and toxic emissions that the oil and gas industry has the tools to control. Communities across the Midwest — particularly those near drilling and processing sites in states like Michigan and North Dakota — will face unnecessary and continued exposure to harmful air pollutants and increased health risks. EPA’s new rule is unlawful and needlessly prioritizes oil and gas interests at the expense of the health, well-being, and quality of life of our communities.” – Wendy Bloom, Senior Attorney, Environmental Law & Policy Center

“Delaying methane rules means more contaminated air, more serious health problems, and deeper harm for working class communities on the frontlines of oil and gas pollution. Protecting people requires enforcement, not delay.”- Meisei Gonzalez, Climate Justice & Clean Air Advocate, GreenLatinos

“By catering to a few rogue actors in the industry and suspending these rules, EPA is blatantly violating the law. If this is allowed to stand, the climate crisis will worsen and communities across the country will be choked in more smog.” – Meredith Hankins, federal climate legal director, NRDC

""EPA's methane rule is a critical safeguard that protects our families and communities from both unclean air and the devastating impacts of climate change. By delaying its implementation over a year and a half after it was finalized, Administrator Lee Zeldin is selling out our families and communities while giving yet another handout to the oil and gas industry. We will vigorously fight this action in court to ensure that the public receives the full — and timely — benefit of the methane rule."" – Andres Restrepo, Sierra Club Senior Attorney

Tennessee's Rise as a Nuclear Energy Leader

Anyone who took a civics class in junior high or high school heard of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), very likely in the context of the Great Depression and the New Deal. The availability of affordable power created through federal action and TVA-owned generation unquestionably expedited electrification of the Tennessee Valley and improved the standard of living for residents. It also spurred industrial development in the region, which not only benefited residents and communities through economic growth but also furthered wider American interests, as manufacturers in increasing numbers began to produce materials for the country's defense needs.

Repurposing civilian industrial capacity to meet the demands of national security may be the most dramatic manifestation of public-private partnership in Tennessee. The most famous of these industrial efforts, and the most consequential, resulted in the selection of Oak Ridge as a facility to produce material for the Manhattan Project. The presence of TVA power figured prominently in the selection of the site for the Manhattan Project – as did the presence of Tennessee Senator Kenneth McKellar on the Senate Appropriations Committee who, when reportedly asked to help mask the $2 billion project appropriation, famously replied to President Roosevelt, ""Where in Tennessee do you want me to hide it?"" The Manhattan Project was a massive effort, in money, material, and personnel, spanning multiple locations in the United States and abroad, and its success resulted from the collaboration of government, academia, and private industry.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is today the largest of the national laboratories, supporting research across multiple disciplines, and continues to be a magnet for public and private investment and innovation, especially in the nuclear field. Private industry has recently announced plans for nuclear fuel cycle facilities, microreactor construction, and the construction and operation of demonstration reactors.

How Government Action Influenced Tennessee's Nuclear Landscape

Senator Howard H. Baker used his position as a member of the Senate, serving on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as in his capacity as minority and majority leader of the Senate, to promote nuclear energy programs. He was instrumental in the development of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, whose site is currently planned for use in efforts by TVA to promote small modular reactors. Senator Baker modeled how Tennessee government leaders could promote nuclear energy with private partners.

Unsurprisingly, Tennessee's state government has emerged as a leader in new nuclear. Governor Lee ordered the creation of the Tennessee Nuclear Energy Advisory Council in May 2023, with members drawn from government, academia, and private industry, the Council's purpose being to make policy recommendations to the state to grow the nuclear industry in Tennessee. The Council's final report included recommendations to support specific projects, such as TVA's Clinch River project, to promote capital investment and nuclear supply chain development in the state, and to develop a nuclear workforce in connection with state higher education. Because of the state's leadership, the region's nuclear heritage, and advocacy of groups, innovative nuclear companies are striving to create a presence in the Oak Ridge area. Private companies such as Radiant Industries, BWXT Enrichment Operations, Oklo, and Kairos Power have planned investments in excess of $2 billion.

At the Federal level, the Trump administration has taken aggressive steps to accelerate new nuclear development, issuing multiple executive orders to achieve that end. The private developmental activities blossoming in Tennessee will put industry in close physical proximity to TVA and Department of Energy sites and promote closer cooperation between those federal agencies, tasked by the administration with furthering its nuclear policy objectives, and the private companies, backed by private financial investment, which can make those objectives a reality. As if to demonstrate this principle, the Department of Energy recently announced that Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in conjunction with Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), would deploy two new supercomputers to promote AI-driven research.

Looking Ahead: Tennessee's Blueprint for America's Energy Future

Since 2023, the Tennessee legislature has appropriated $70 million for the Tennessee Nuclear Fund. The Fund, administered by the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD), is designed to promote nuclear development and manufacturing in the state through grants and other forms of assistance. As of December 2025, the fund has awarded more than $35 million to nuclear-related projects, from state workforce development programs and infrastructure improvements to private companies seeking to establish or expand their presence in Tennessee.

It is no accident that most of these projects are in the greater Knoxville/Oak Ridge area. These companies have already recognized the value of being in close physical proximity to ORNL and to TVA. Some are working directly with the Department of Energy, the TVA, or both. Kairos Power, for example, is constructing a demonstration reactor on Department of Energy land in Oak Ridge and recently announced a power purchase agreement with TVA to power data centers in the region. And TVA, the Department of Energy, and the State of Tennessee are actively seeking other arrangements with private industry to further develop the nuclear energy ecosystem in the state.

Information for Companies Interested in Nuclear Energy Programs in Tennessee

The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development maintains the Nuclear Energy Fund grants and other incentives for companies seeking to locate or expand activities in the state.

The Tennessee Valley Authority has several additional resources, including a slate of available properties and targeted incentive programs, available for businesses.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory recently established a new grant program, the Innovation and Research for Industry Success (IRIS) program, to facilitate research and long-term investment.

Although these agencies' economic development resources are accessible on a rolling basis, some resources are subject to availability, and companies contemplating Tennessee growth should engage with these agencies early on in their planning.

In 1953, President Eisenhower delivered his ""Atoms for Peace"" speech to the United Nations General Assembly, pledging the United States would ""devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life."" With the combined efforts of government and private action, Tennessee is poised to help the country do just that. Tennessee's long history of cooperation between public and private institutions established Tennessee as a leader in nuclear energy development, serving as a lighthouse for other states aspiring to address this nation's energy needs.",https://www.bakerdonelson.com/images/_wbmanaged/screenshot2025-12-03162902_wbc_socialimage_165886.png,N,,2025-12-04 14:01:54.602229

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

For decades, noxious, cancer-causing gases poured from some of the nation’s largest industrial polluters, seeping invisibly from cracks in antiquated pipes or billowing out of smokestacks in plumes that choked the communities nearby.

And for decades, the Environmental Protection Agency tracked those emissions not by monitoring the air but by relying on a kind of honor system. Companies were allowed to estimate their chemical pollution using methods that even the EPA conceded were often unreliable.

In 2023, the EPA received irrefutable proof that these estimates were highly flawed. The agency had required 20 industrial facilities to temporarily install air monitors around their perimeters — known as fence-line monitoring — to see how bad the pollution actually was.

The results, compiled now for the first time by ProPublica, were shocking.

In virtually every case, the actual emissions were higher — often much higher — than the estimates, ProPublica found. At one steel industry plant near Pittsburgh, a potent carcinogen was found at levels more than 30 times higher than estimated. In Louisiana, a chemical facility recorded levels of another toxic chemical that were 156 times higher.

Despite industry opposition, the EPA took action last year. More than 130 industrial facilities would have to install permanent air monitors, starting as soon as this year. Communities surrounding some of the country’s most notorious polluters would finally get a glimpse of what they were breathing. The monitors would act as a warning system: If pollution levels were to exceed new standards set by the EPA, the facility would have to find the source of the leaks and fix them. In fact, among the 20 plants that were forced to conduct temporary monitoring, half would have violated these standards, ProPublica found.

Then, shortly after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, his administration announced it was putting a halt to the effort. Not only was Trump’s EPA going to reconsider the new requirements — the first step in rolling them back — but companies in the meantime could apply for two-year exemptions allowing them to evade the rules altogether.

In a matter of weeks, regulations that took years to enact had been sidestepped in favor of keeping the status quo.

The implications are far-reaching. More than 5 million people face an increased risk of developing cancer because they live near the type of plants that would have been subject to the new emission rules, according to the EPA. That number is almost certainly an undercount because it’s based on the companies’ flawed estimates of their emissions.

The White House referred ProPublica to the EPA, which responded to a detailed summary of our findings with an email from its press office acknowledging a “discrepancy” between the self-reported emissions and air monitoring data. “However, we have not determined the cause of the discrepancy. We will explore this as part of the reconsideration” of the rules, the email said.

For environmentalists and some of the millions living near these polluters, Trump’s reversals have been a gut punch.

“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Haley Lewis, senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group founded by a former EPA enforcement official. If the EPA chooses to abandon fence-line monitoring, then it’s leaving “meaningful, affordable and achievable” emissions cuts on the table, Lewis said. The only reason to do that is “they don’t want their true emissions to be known.”

‘The more we learned, the more afraid we were’

Coal piles up like black sand dunes outside Clairton Coke Works just south of Pittsburgh. The largest coke-making facility in the Western Hemisphere, its ovens have been operating since 1916. Heat from the 2,000-degree ovens bake raw coal into coke, a carbon-rich material essential to converting iron ore and limestone into steel.

Benzene, an invisible gas linked to blood cancers and anemia, streams out of the plant alongside specks of particulate matter and stinking sulfur compounds. Other chemicals escape from tiny openings, seams and oven doors that don’t close tightly.

The hilly terrain of the Monongahela River valley forms the perfect trap for air pollution. During temperature inversions, when cold air gets stuck beneath a layer of warm air, residents walk around in a cloud of stagnant pollution.

Miriam Maletta, who runs a hair salon in Clairton, wonders if the prosperity U.S. Steel brought to town was worth the health toll. Despite its decline, the iconic company continues to employ more than 3,000 workers in the region and remains a source of local pride.

Maletta’s brother James worked as a driver for U.S. Steel in the 1970s, she recalled; when he blew his nose after work, his snot was black with soot. Their father died from gastric cancer in 2009 after more than 20 years of working for the coke plant. Maletta, 62, was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2016 and is now in remission, she said. Some limited data suggests a link between air pollution and the two cancers, though it’s virtually impossible to prove that exposure to chemicals caused a specific person’s illness.

Her mother has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is more commonly associated with smoking but is also linked to air pollution. Maletta said her mother never smoked.

In the last seven years, local records show, the county health department has levied fines against U.S. Steel of more than $10 million for allegedly violating federal, state and county air pollution regulations. The company often appeals the cases, settling them for smaller amounts. The dangers of the plant were underscored for residents when the coke facility caught fire in 2018, choking the valley with toxic gases. Emergency room visits for asthma spiked.

Long after the company fixed the equipment that caused the fire, Cindy Meckel, 66, said she struggled to climb the stairs while bringing in the groceries at her home more than a mile from the plant. Her husband David, 77, would nearly pass out swinging a sledgehammer. Their eyes burned after a 30-minute walk with their rottweiler, Nixon.

After Cindy was diagnosed with anemia, she wondered if benzene emissions had played a role. The iron supplements she took as treatment wreaked havoc on her stomach. “The more we knew, the more we learned, the more afraid we were,” Cindy said.

She and David provided depositions to support a lawsuit that two environmental groups filed against U.S. Steel in 2019. The lawsuit said local residents had experienced headaches, fatigue and difficulty breathing, symptoms they believe were caused by excess emissions of dangerous pollutants released after the fire. U.S. Steel disputed the accusations in court filings, saying it “lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief” about the cause of the alleged health effects. The company eventually settled the lawsuit; U.S. Steel agreed to pay nearly $20 million to upgrade the facility and another $5 million for local clean air programs.

The Meckels and Maletta joined a grassroots organization called Valley Clean Air Now, which advocated for the region’s cluster of industrial towns, including Clairton. They distributed indoor air filters and urged a crackdown on U.S. Steel at public meetings.

A critical question remained: How much pollution was pouring from the Clairton Coke Works?

Industrial companies are required to report their emissions to the EPA, but it’s not an easy task. Facility staff can take direct measurements of pollutants by sticking a scientific instrument inside a smokestack for several hours, for example. But a sprawling plant like Clairton’s has miles of pipelines and up to thousands of components like valves and fittings that could leak toxic gases. Trying to measure every potential leak would be enormously difficult.

So the EPA allows facilities to provide estimates using numbers called emission factors. Each emission factor estimates the leaks produced by a specific industrial process, such as the amount of benzene expected to be released from a “light-oil storage tank” at a coke manufacturing plant.

The EPA began compiling emission factors decades ago to help determine large-scale air pollution trends. As individual facilities started using them to estimate their emissions, the potential for errors grew. Emission factors are often based on a limited number of measurements taken in the field or in the lab. They assume that the same process always leaks at roughly the same rate, even though some are highly variable. It would be like insisting that every bundt cake should take an hour to bake, though baking times vary depending on the ingredients and the oven temperature.

Over the years, numerous studies and reports from government watchdogs, including the EPA’s Office of Inspector General, have criticized the use of emission factors and recommended changes. The EPA itself has recognized since at least 1990 that emission factors are problematic. Records show that it considers many of the coke oven emission factors “poor” or “below average” in terms of accuracy.

The EPA takes a facility’s estimated emissions and plugs the numbers into air modeling software to calculate the level of toxic chemicals leaking into the surrounding community. The software models how plumes of chemicals from different parts of a plant disperse across the property, given wind patterns and other factors.

In 2023, as the EPA weighed stricter regulations for coke plants, the agency took the Clairton benzene estimates and put them into the modeling program. The results appeared reassuring: They predicted that the maximum benzene level near the fence line was higher than what’s typically found in outdoor air but represented a low cancer risk and was well under the concentration that regulators recommend to avoid other health problems.

But when the EPA required Clairton to install temporary air monitors at its perimeter, there was a stark difference.

‘Oh good, it’s working’

Fence-line monitoring has proven a powerful tool in reducing pollution.

A decade ago under President Barack Obama, the EPA tightened requirements for oil refineries, insisting facilities install benzene monitoring equipment around their perimeters and curtail emissions when levels exceed a certain standard. Monitors revealed that refineries had often been releasing more benzene than they had estimated in reports to the government. One refinery in New Mexico measured annual average benzene that was more than 100 times the level the EPA model had predicted based on its prior reports.

Soon, benzene levels near refineries began to plummet. The amount around the New Mexico refinery fell dramatically in four years; by 2022, it complied with EPA’s refinery benzene standard.

After President Joe Biden took office, the EPA proposed similar air monitors for other industrial facilities. The Clairton facility was one of five coke plants required to set up fence-line monitors for six months. All five showed higher levels of benzene than the EPA had calculated using the facilities’ estimates.

The Clairton monitors showed that the actual benzene levels at its fence line were 37 times higher than estimated.

U.S. Steel vehemently opposed the EPA’s proposal to require permanent fence-line monitors for coke plants, arguing that the benzene standard was too stringent. Five Democratic senators, including both from Pennsylvania, told the EPA last year that the new requirements would cost too much and “pose a threat to our steel industry’s global economic competitiveness while yielding minimal environmental benefits.”

The EPA estimates that fence-line monitoring would cost coke plants about $107,000 per year. (U.S. Steel had $1.4 billion in cash at the end of 2024, financial records show.) The true costs, however, would be far greater because the company would likely have to invest heavily to patch up innumerable leaks identified with the help of the monitors.

ProPublica provided U.S. Steel with a detailed summary of our findings. “U. S. Steel is committed to working with the EPA and supports regulations that are well-grounded in law; and are based on sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts. Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps,” Andrew Fulton, a company spokesperson, said in an email. The “EPA remains open to revising the 2024 rule and we look forward to joining industry partners in continuing discussions with the agency.”

In addition to the five coke manufacturers, the EPA required temporary fence-line monitors at 11 large chemical plants and four iron and steel mills. The pattern was the same.

The monitoring at the 20 facilities yielded 37 sets of fence-line data that could be compared against the results derived from their self-reported emissions. In all but one of those cases, or 97% of the time, the monitoring revealed the facilities had underestimated their emissions.

That included a Dow Chemical facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana, where levels of vinyl chloride, a dangerous carcinogen, were in reality 156 times higher than the EPA calculated based on the plant’s estimates. Concentrations of ethylene dichloride, another carcinogen, around the facility were a whopping 1,033 times higher.

Ten of the plants were leaking dangerous chemicals at higher volumes than the EPA’s new rules would have allowed. Around one Indorama chemical manufacturing plant in Port Neches, Texas, monitors showed that concentrations of ethylene oxide, a potent carcinogen, would be seven times the standard set by the EPA. And for a Formosa plastics plant in Point Comfort, Texas, ethylene dichloride levels exceeded the EPA standard and were actually 69 times higher than had been expected based on its self-reported estimates.

“Dow will continue working closely with regulatory authorities to protect the safety of our employees and surrounding communities,” Glynna Mayers, a spokesperson for Dow, which also owns Union Carbide, said in an email. “We remain committed to operating reliably and advancing efforts to reduce emissions below their already safe levels.”

Indorama didn’t respond to a request for comment. A Formosa spokesperson said the company conducts air monitoring in the neighborhood near the facility and shares the results with Texas regulators. Formosa has also taken steps to reduce emissions of ethylene dichloride over the last decade, the spokesperson said. Companies that owned the other facilities did not respond to requests for comment.

Experts say the industrial plants most likely to underestimate their emissions are the ones with extensive networks of pipelines, valves, compressors, pumps and storage tanks. It’s nearly impossible to project emissions from so many dispersed sources, said Cary Secrest, a former EPA employee who spent 20 years inspecting industrial plants and now works at a company that measures pollution.

“I don’t think that companies are deliberately trying to underestimate emissions,” Secrest said. “I just think that it’s impossible without actual measurements.”

While there’s no comprehensive list of these types of facilities, chemical manufacturers and coke plants are vulnerable to pervasive leaks — especially if they’re badly maintained, he said. Instead of allowing polluters to rely on emission factors that are little better than a “fantasy,” he said, the agency should require more direct monitoring — even if those techniques are more expensive.

David Meckel spoke up at a public hearing in 2023 and told EPA officials that Clairton Coke Works had ruined his health. He could no longer cut his grass without resting to catch his breath, he said. “I stagger around like a fish out of water.”

The EPA’s final coke plants rule, released in May 2024 under Biden, required the facilities to conduct fence-line monitoring and keep their annual average benzene emissions below a certain level. Because benzene is often leaking alongside other pollutants, curbing benzene would also reduce overall emissions, the EPA explained.

For the Meckels, it felt like a victory. “It did sort of make you feel energized,” Cindy said, as if they could finally breathe and say, “‘Oh good, it’s working.’”

‘It’s hurting the people”

In addition to promising a new era of accountability for coke manufacturers, two new rules adopted by the EPA last year would have required more than 120 larger chemical plants, as well as a handful of steel and iron mills, to install air monitors and limit their emissions.

The communities at highest risk, like those in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, would have benefited the most. The Dow Chemical plant that underestimated its emissions is part of a cluster of industrial facilities near the city of Plaquemine, Louisiana. The combined emissions from local polluters create a lifetime cancer risk of 100 in a million for rural residents nearby, according to the latest EPA risk map from 2020. That figure, which means that 100 people out of a million would be expected to develop cancer after a lifetime of exposure, is at the very limit of what the EPA considers acceptable — though many public health experts say that threshold is too lenient. That risk number is also likely an underestimate, since it was calculated from self-reported emissions data.

About 90,000 people living near larger chemical plants face an unacceptable risk of developing cancer, the EPA said. The agency estimated that the new limits on chemicals would have cut that number to 3,000 residents — a drop of 97%.

In March, on what the Trump administration touted as the “the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in the history of the United States,” the EPA announced it would reconsider or roll back 31 environmental regulations and programs, including the three with fence-line monitoring requirements. That marked the start of a lengthy process that could erase or water down the rules.

Meanwhile, the president has so far given two-year exemptions from the regulations to some 50 chemical plants, including the Louisiana Dow facility and the Indorama and Formosa facilities in Texas. (Environmentalists recently sued the administration over these exemptions. The EPA press office said the agency doesn’t comment on current or pending litigation; the White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.)

Mayers, the Dow spokesperson, said the extensions for complying with the rule “are appropriate and necessary to address technical challenges and maintain the safe, efficient operation of our facilities.”

U.S. Steel applied for an exemption for its Clairton plant; Fulton, the company spokesperson, said a decision on the application is pending. In its application, which ProPublica obtained via a public records request, the company said the fence-line monitoring requirement was too stringent. The application stated that finding and fixing the root cause of excess leaks would be costly and complex given the “many miles of piping and thousands of valves and flanges at a coke facility.”

The loss of the promised monitoring has left some in its neighboring communities disillusioned. One resident wondered what was the point of talking to reporters and regulators if nothing was going to change.

Another local, Qiyam Ansari, who is also executive director of Valley Clean Air Now, said he and other residents have to look for solutions outside the federal government. The organization is working with public health researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to conduct a local health survey in hopes that the results might inspire stricter local regulations.

The work is deeply personal to the 29-year-old Ansari. He nearly died from an asthma attack as a teenager after his family moved close to a local U.S. Steel mill. He still lives nearby; every room in his house has an air purifier. Even his cat Kiki has asthma, he said, and she didn’t appreciate him shoving a feline inhaler over her face.

The environment was on his mind when Ansari voted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last November. A lot of his neighbors voted for Trump, whose first administration rolled back many air protections.

Among them were the Meckels. Cindy said she was worried about inflation and illegal immigration. She and David are now bitterly disappointed by Trump’s environmental policies.

“It’s hurting the people. He’s supposed to be for the people,” David said. “That’s wrong, he’s being stupid!”

This spring, the Meckels moved one county north. Cindy said the final straw was when Nixon died at age 5. He was their third dog in eight years to die after a cancer diagnosis. His death, she said, reinforced how vulnerable their own health is.

They’re not giving up, Cindy said. “We’re escaping with our lives because we gave it everything we could do and it didn’t matter.”",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1125_steelplant_1600.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-04 11:10:06.509357

About ERM Sustainability is our business.","New research from GlobeScan and the ERM Sustainability Institute shows that climate change remains the most urgent global sustainability priority for 2025 according to sustainability professionals across the world, while concern for other critical issues such as biodiversity, diversity, and water scarcity has declined slightly. The findings also reveal a growing emphasis on renewable energy, low-carbon development, and cross-sector collaboration.

The survey of 391 expert stakeholders from business, civil society, government and academia across 57 countries, took place between 26 August and 21 October, 2025. The survey ranked the top sustainability issues, captured most important sustainability developments, and explored views of leadership in the NGO and corporate sectors.

Top sustainability issues, developments and priorities

Climate change remains the top concern (cited as urgent by 94 percent of respondents), while urgency around issues such as biodiversity, deforestation, diversity, water scarcity, and labor conditions in supply chains has weakened.

Legislation continues to be viewed as the most impactful driver of sustainability progress, though its perceived importance has declined significantly compared to 2024 (cited by 18 percent of experts in 2025 vs. 33 percent in 2024).

Emerging priorities include renewable energy and low-carbon development, biodiversity initiatives, and global/multi-stakeholder collaboration.

Expert views on corporate and NGO sustainability leadership remain steady

Patagonia retains its position as the most recognized corporate sustainability leader (cited by 36 percent of experts), with IKEA, Unilever, and Natura &Co following. Meanwhile, companies such as Schneider Electric, Microsoft, Interface, and Ørsted gain recognition in specific regions.

WWF remains by far the most recognized NGO for sustainability leadership (cited by 44 percent of respondents), followed by Greenpeace (cited by 15 percent), World Resources Institute (cited by 12 percent) and The Nature Conservancy (cited by 10 percent).

Integrating sustainability into business strategy is viewed as key to sustainability leadership

Making sustainability a core business driver is seen as the top attribute of corporate sustainability leaders (cited by 26 percent of respondents).

Demonstrating evidence of impact and actions and focusing on supply chains are also consistent drivers of recognized leadership.

Chris Coulter, CEO at GlobeScan said: “This year’s survey highlights both progress and persistent challenges. Climate change remains the defining issue, but we also see stakeholders pointing to companies and NGOs that are focused on driving more innovation and collaboration in the sustainability agenda.”

Mark Lee, Global Director of Thought Leadership at ERM, said: “Our survey findings reflect the strong belief across sectors and regions that sustainability must be embedded in business strategy and drive commercial results. These are the key factors that define sustainability leadership today, and the companies that adopt this approach will be well-positioned to benefit from enhanced resilience and value creation opportunities.”

A clear mandate for action

The 2025 Leaders Survey results set a clear mandate for organizations to act decisively. Leadership organizations in all sectors are encouraged to focus on sustainability issues that deliver measurable impact and financial value, secure clean and reliable energy, and meet rising regulatory and stakeholder expectations, even as budgets tighten. Success will depend on falling costs for renewable and low-carbon technologies, accelerating operational and value chain decarbonization, and embracing digital solutions.

At the same time, the research findings reveal both progress and stagnation, underscoring that sustained innovation and cross-sector collaboration will be essential to maintain momentum and drive meaningful change in a rapidly evolving sustainability landscape.

Notes to editors

The GlobeScan / ERM Sustainability Institute Leaders Survey is an annual study that highlights the most urgent priorities in the current global sustainable development agenda.

The 2025 survey examines private sector and civil society sustainability leadership in addition to monitoring priority issues over time and tracking notable shifts in their perceived importance. This year's survey was conducted between August and October 2025 and reflects input from almost 400 sustainability experts across nearly 60 countries.

UNC-CH Media Hub Student Correspondent

On a warm day in the spring, when you look at a bright flower and see a bee dancing around on the inside of the plant, that creature is likely just making a stop on a long journey before it returns to its home — its hive. But odds are, that hive might not be the structure in a tree you are thinking of. It very well might just be the result of someone’s hard work right in their backyard.

Apiculture — the technical term for beekeeping — is a major industry across the state of North Carolina. Many counties — over 80 out of the 100 in North Carolina — and the state as a whole, have their own beekeeping associations.

The North Carolina State Beekeeping Association has over 4,000 active members across the state, making it the largest organized association for beekeepers in the country. And North Carolina, in general, has somewhere close to 15,000 beekeepers — whether it be a person growing a new hobby, an individual understanding the science behind the craft or someone attempting to make a living out of the process — according to North Carolina State University.

Because of the multitude of motivations behind beekeeping, NCSU even has an extensive apiculture program to further the understanding of honey bee biology and to improve bee management.

Jennifer Keller, research specialist and apiculture technician at NCSU, said there are still a lot of mysteries surrounding beekeeping — like why some colonies excel in their lifespan more than others — that scientists are still trying to understand in their research. However, Keller and her colleagues see the clear necessity of honey bees in our world.

“Honey bees, as well as other native bees, are very important for pollinating to produce good crops, and even some of the crops that are not dependent on bees will have an added benefit from the pollination of bees,” she said. “If there are no honey bees around, they may still produce a crop, but with honey bees, they’ll produce more of that same crop, so that’s better for farmers. Without bees, things wouldn’t be as good — there’s some crops that are dependent on bees that just would not be able to happen as much.”

The importance of honey bees, as well as the niche interest of the craft, is part of why thousands of individuals across the state participate in beekeeping, whether as a hobby or a commercial business.

Beekeeping as a hobby

Lisa Vogel has always had a piece of bees in her life.

When she was a child growing up in the mountains of North Carolina, she remembers her dad — a self-proclaimed honey aficionado — bringing in different kinds of honey for her to try, from sour wood to whipped, all the result of a bee’s hard work.

Then, 10 years ago, out of pure curiosity, she visited the home of a friend who was a beekeeper to see her process.

“I was hooked immediately,” Vogel said. “It was like, I feel like I did this in another life or something. I mean, it was crazy. You know, when you find a hobby that you just instantly love? It was that feeling.”

Now, a decade later, Vogel cares for nine hives on the property of her home in Orange County, North Carolina. And whether she is harvesting the honey-filled frames from her hives or protecting her bees from the common risk of varroa mites, she has several tricks she has learned over the years.

Bee risk and tricks

Though a beekeeper should not constantly interfere with their hive, when the bees are at risk, the keeper might have to step in. One of the main risks facing bees right now is the presence of varroa mites, an external parasitic mite that attacks and feeds on honey bees.

While each beekeeper has a different method to protect their hive from this parasite, Vogel said that she checks for the issue once every five weeks during the warm months — which is often one of her only reasons for going into the hive at all.

After doing an inspection, if she finds a significant number of mites, Vogel will treat her hive with a mite medication or an alcohol wash. She said she learned this trick from a North Carolina beekeeper and apiary inspector, Lewis Cauble.

In addition to keeping her hive safe, Vogel has a trick for ensuring the queen bee is alive by looking for eggs on frames. Because while the whole hive is important, the queen has her title for a reason.

“If the queen dies, then the hive dies, possibly — especially if they don’t have any eggs to raise a new queen,” Vogel said. “If they don’t have a queen, they don’t have eggs, and they’re doomed.”

And if that were to occur, one would have to purchase a new queen from a beekeeping shop — like Bailey Bee Supply in Hillsborough — to maintain the integrity of a hive and reduce the risk of losing more bees. Thus, the maintenance of a hive is critical. Having the knowledge to do so is, too, which is why Justin Maness created his Durham-based company, Buddha Bee Apiary.

Maness’s business is built around the idea of him and his employees, like Claudia Roller, managing beehives in clients’ yards and educating individuals on proper practices.

“We just focus on the education and the experience of people getting the opportunity to come out and be in hives with us and see what it’s all about,” Roller said.

Roller studied chemistry at Goucher College in Maryland, and when she first started working for Maness, she had never even seen a hive in her life. But she was intrigued by the scientific aspect of apiculture, and over the past several years, she has become a beekeeper herself, inspecting hives and making sure the pollinators are cared for. She is now even interested in going to school to get a master’s degree in apiculture from somewhere like NCSU to further her knowledge and the research of beekeeping.

Buddha Bee does not sell any honey from their business, but rather focuses on that education aspect and growing the beekeeping industry, as a whole.

“We only harvest honey if the hive is able to handle us taking some,” Roller said. “And then we give it right back to the people who are hosting a hive. So if you have a hive in your backyard, you’re getting your honey right from your backyard.”

Honey production

But while Buddha Bee does not profit from its production, the sticky, sweet golden substance is a major aspect of beekeeping, and keepers like Vogel do share their hive’s product.

“I sell it at different places around Orange County,” she said. “This year I’ll be selling it mostly to friends, and I do a Holiday Market where I sell it as well.”

However, this venture is not about making money for Vogel; in fact, she said she does not make much of a profit at all, especially since she does not extract her own honey — which is a different process entirely.

Extraction is the process of separating honey from beeswax combs to harvest it for use. When Vogel needs this done, she takes her frames to an extractor in Mebane, North Carolina, before she bottles the product.

Vogel said she does not do extraction, not only because she does not have the equipment for it, but because, with her age, the process is too heavy a task for her. For Phil Crump, though, extraction is just another step in his beekeeping process as a whole.

Bees and the economy

Crump has been beekeeping for almost 50 years and, according to Vogel, is a salesman extraordinaire. He primarily sells honey at events through Plant Delights Nursery, a small business in Wake County, North Carolina, and begins the honey process from step one.

From suiting up in protective covering to having hands-on time with the buzzing creatures to harvesting the golden frames, Crump does it all. Then, when he finally reaches the extraction element, Crump has a honed-down method.

“You’re going to take your knife, and it saws, kind of, and you can see how I’m just taking those cappings off,” Crump said as he started the process. “And then I’m just going to go down, and I like to not damage the comb any more than necessary. Some people just get in there and they’ll start digging it. There’s another method that you can use that uses a hot knife and it melts the wax off. But I just think this is the least destructive method, and that’s what I like to do, is not to damage this any more than necessary, so that the bees can repair it or utilize it.”

The harvesting and extraction process allows Crump to produce a profit from selling products at events.

He said that he typically sells a bottle of honey for around $30, and while that might seem like a steep price, with the effort and time that has been put in, at the end of the day, that outcome makes sense and people will buy it.

“I can market my honey in a location where people are already coming to spend money,” Crump said. “They’re already anticipating buying something. This is a nursery that sells rare and unusual plants, so they’re not inexpensive plants. They’re not going to Lowe’s [Hardware]. So that’s a unique component. I can’t make money at the farmer’s market because people from Eastern North Carolina come and they’re selling their honey so cheap I can’t even compete.”

Crump said that the honey production business is hard, but what makes it harder is when these individuals sell their honey for a lower price than what other keepers see fit. This practice hurts people like Crump who try to support themselves through their sales. This way of selling and overharvesting can also create poor beekeeping practices.

Overharvesting occurs when beekeepers remove too much honey from a hive. This leads to colony collapse by depleting a hive’s food stores, forcing beekeepers to rely on supplemental feeding, which can add stress and is not a sustainable practice for the colony’s long-term health — which though is not especially common, it is something Crump tries to avoid entirely.

The community

But Crump said that beyond just the honey harvesting and business of beekeeping, the people make it what it is.

“My interest is honey production, but I’d say at least half of what interests me about beekeeping is the fellowship,” he said. “[I] really enjoy the people. It’s a great group of people. They’re real.”

Vogel said that many of the practices she has learned have been through personal research or from the greater beekeeping community, in general. It is this community that truly defines beekeeping in North Carolina.

And it is that community that has also grown Eva Walker’s interest in the craft, despite being a standout among her peers.

Walker is a senior at Durham Academy Upper School and has been a beekeeper for almost four years. She has a hive at her home in Durham that she maintains with her father, as well as one that she set up at her high school that she uses to help educate other students about beekeeping.

While she is not necessarily in the same age group as many other beekeepers in North Carolina, Walker has still formed various connections. She said that the community is so tight-knit across the state that everyone seems to know each other or is able to bond over this niche hobby.

“Being young, I’m sort of at an advantage, because people want to hear [about it],” she said. “There’s questions of like, ‘Wow, you’re so young, how’d you get into this?’”

So while the motivation behind beekeeping varies for each person — whether for education, a fun hobby, a profession or anything else — the root of the enjoyment of the craft lies in the community and the opportunity to protect, preserve and promote the lives of the creatures that keep nature so bright.",https://thelocalreporter.press/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-local-reporter-logo-round-3-option-1-3-e1566310206658-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-04 12:01:40.660501

This electrified road is a futuristic win for EV drivers

It’s a new age dilemma: having to plan your journey around charging up your electric car – but now it seems that there could be a solution.

In Detroit, the genius invention of an electrified road has got people charged up, and it’s safe to say it could save drivers precious time.

In 2023, the road opened, which consisted of a ‘quarter-mile segment of 14th Street’, facilitated by Electreon.

The road is able to charge cars by using inductive coils that are able to charge the cars as they drive on, wirelessly.

The clever electrified road was the first of its kind to be installed in North America, with stationary charging points also included in the grand plans.

It was Sweden built the first permanent electrified road in the world in 2018 with the eRoadArlanda project near Stockholm.

But, how does wireless charging actually work?

Well, firstly, it connects the energy from the coils when an EV turns onto the electrified road.

Next, the Michigan Department of Transportation and other traffic centers collect accurate real-time information

Finally, the car in question receives the charge energy wirelessly, from the coils to the battery, allowing the car to charge up on the go.

As the saying goes: ‘nothing good comes easy’ – especially with EVs

Even though the electrified road does add charge to EVs, there is a catch with usage and eligibility.

Reportedly, only electric vehicles fitted with the right receivers that are on their base can use it, according to the BBC.

But technology is ever evolving.

“Developing electrified roadways may be the catalyst to accelerate interest and acceptance of EVs for all consumers.

“This collaboration supports a more sustainable future with fewer emissions,” Michigan Department of Transportation Director Bradley C. Wieferich said.

So, this really could be the next big EV trend. Keep an eye out for wireless charging roads near you.

The family of a Colombian fisherman killed in a U.S. military boat strike has filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, claiming his death was murder. Alejandro Carranza Medina was killed on September 15th when the US military struck his boat in the Caribbean. U.S. strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have killed more than 80 people on boats that Washington claims were carrying drugs from Venezuela, though they haven't provided evidence. Family members and victims' governments say some of those killed were fishermen, and rights groups say the strikes are illegal even if the targets were drug traffickers.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated the entire Oak Ridge Reservation an EPA Superfund site in 1989 under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

The Oak Ridge Reservation cannot be deleted from the National Priorities List of the most serious hazardous waste sites in the United States until the EPA declares that the U.S. Department of Energy has completed appropriate cleanup actions and achieved cleanup goals with respect to radioactive and toxic chemical materials. A Superfund site can be delisted if a remedial investigation shows that the contamination poses no significant risk to human health or the environment.

The cleanup of contaminated sites on the reservation managed by DOE may not be complete until the 2050s and yet most of the managed reservation’s 33,069 acres are undisturbed or clean now, said Erik Olds, who has served as manager of the Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management since June 2025. (Editor's note: This story on Olds' talk was written months prior to the Dec. 3 announcement that 16,377 acres on the Oak Ridge Reservation don't require cleanup and can be reused.)

He noted that he is now talking to EPA about removing hundreds of acres of clean Oak Ridge Reservation land managed by DOE from its National Priorities List. The reservation also includes more than 25,000 acres that are privately owned.

Also in 1989, DOE formed the Office of Environmental Management (EM) to lead the cleanup of contaminated DOE research and production sites nationwide. On the Oak Ridge Reservation those sites were primarily the K-25 Site (three gaseous diffusion plants for producing enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants – K-25, K-29 and K-33), the Y-12 National Security Complex (where highly enriched uranium is stored and where old buildings are contaminated with uranium and mercury) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which has radioactive and chemical hazards.

In a recent talk to an Oak Ridge Institute for Continued Learning class at the new William J. Wilcox K-25 Interpretive Center in Oak Ridge, Olds called the total cleanup of the K-25 Site “monumental and incredible.” He spoke after Ray Smith, Oak Ridge city historian, presented a brief history of the gaseous diffusion plants that enriched uranium for 40 years at the K-25 Site.

The cleanup operations completed at the K-25 site included deactivating, decommissioning and demolishing buildings, as well as removing contaminated soil and remediating polluted groundwater. Deactivation, which is underway at ORNL and Y-12, means removing contaminated piping, process equipment and other nuclear and chemical hazards from each building before demolishing it, isolating slightly contaminated construction materials onsite and transporting highly contaminated material for disposal as far away as Nevada, Texas and Utah.

Olds said Oak Ridge was the first site in the world to remove a former uranium enrichment complex. Under contract to OREM, United Cleanup Oak Ridge (UCOR) removed by 2020 some 500 contaminated structures from the K-25 site, which had a footprint of about 225 football fields.

Olds called Oak Ridge a “trailblazer” in preparing for reuse by companies previously decontaminated land.

“Oak Ridge launched DOE’s first reindustrialization program in 1996 with support and input from the community,” he said. “The purpose was to help offset the loss of jobs caused by the shutdown of the enrichment plants on the K-25 Site in 1987.”

In 1997, the area embracing the K-25 Site and the two industrial parks, Horizon Center and Heritage Center, were renamed the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP). DOE established a unique partnership with the Community Reuse Organization of East Tennessee (CROET) to make land and buildings available to the private sector.

Transferring many acres of land for other uses

Thanks to the final cleanup of the K-25 Site in 2024, including soil cleanup and major field work, the OREM vision for ETTP is to foster not only economic development, but also conservation and historic preservation.

“We have transferred 1,850 acres for economic development and hundreds more are slated for transfer over the next two years,” Olds said. “ETTP is home to 25 private businesses, and that number will continue to grow as the cleaned-up land is transferred.” He noted that nuclear companies interested in building uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel production plants and small modular reactors are buying ETTP land.

“Cleanup progress has transformed the area from a liability into a community asset that is attracting billions of dollars in new investments, primarily by nuclear companies. ETTP will be surrounded by 3,500 acres of natural areas with trails and greenways that EM will transfer for conservation, enabling residents and visitors to enjoy the beauty of East Tennessee.”

The Wilcox Interpretive Center where Olds spoke and the nearby K-25 Atomic History Center are examples of use of the former K-25 Site for historic preservation.

“I’d say over the next year EM is probably going to transfer about 4,600 acres,” he added, noting that land transfer is not easy and that EM must work very closely with EPA and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to transfer any piece of land.

“We have to prove we’ve cleaned that land up to a level where it can be safely transferred and used later on for an industrial reuse,” he remarked.

Because the Oak Ridge Reservation has so much land that is clean, Olds hopes to convince EPA that it should not be considered part of a Superfund site and should be delisted because it poses no significant risk to human health or the environment.

Nevertheless, Oak Ridge is listed as one of the 15 DOE sites that remains “an active cleanup operation,” Olds said. Since the EM program started in 1989, DOE has cleaned up 92 of the 107 sites across the country that had initially been designated as contaminated.

Cleanup of ORNL, Y-12 under way

Olds, who has worked in EM activities in Nevada, Washington state, South Carolina and Washington, D.C., is now overseeing the environmental cleanup, decontamination and decommissioning activities at ORNL and Y-12. These campuses now are the most contaminated areas of the reservation.

UCOR is working under OREM’s leadership to remove contaminated equipment from buildings, dispose of it, demolish the decontaminated buildings and clean up the land and waterways, which represent about 50% of the land DOE manages on the reservation. Olds said the cleanup job now under way at these two sites is complicated and might take almost three decades.

“For a small site, Oak Ridge is by far the most complex site I’ve ever worked at,” Olds said. He noted that three distinct DOE offices are involved in funding work at ORNL and Y-12: EM at both; the DOE Office of Science at ORNL, and the National Nuclear Security Administration at Y-12 (NNSA is the weapons part of DOE). The three DOE programs are “working together to the benefit of not only DOE’s scientific research and production missions but also its cleanup mission, which actually helps the other missions,” he added.

Olds said that ORNL and Y-12 need land for new buildings to carry out new missions and to replace out-of-date facilities that are, in some cases, 60 to 80 years old.

“So, we’re cleaning up a lot of land, clearing out old infrastructure, and removing hazards so modern labs and other facilities can be built” for science and defense missions, he said. Unlike the case at K-25, he added, “We won’t provide any of that land to the community for redevelopment, but we will give the clean land back to DOE programs.”

He noted that the EM cleanup work at ORNL and Y-12 protects the workforce and the public because it prevents the toxic material, including uranium and transuranium elements, from being dispersed and released to the air.

Olds said that equipment and soil that are highly contaminated are transported to the federal disposal facility at the Nevada Test Site or other facilities in Texas and Utah.

“Other material that’s really not contaminated with either chemicals or radiological materials we dispose of here on site because it is basically construction waste,” he said.

Olds was asked about the fate of mercury-contaminated equipment in Y-12 buildings, where in the 1950s and 1960s mercury was used to enable the separation of lithium isotopes. The purpose was to provide the federal government with lithium-6 to help create a more explosive hydrogen bomb.

Olds said that wall material and equipment contaminated with mercury is sent off-site but other building materials not tainted with mercury are disposed of onsite. He noted that tearing down these buildings might set some mercury free.

“Once you start mobilizing mercury, it’s good to have a way to capture it,” Olds said. He added that the recently completed Mercury Treatment Plant will trap mercury and keep it from entering East Fork Poplar Creek.

Olds said when it’s time to demolish a building, continuous air monitors are placed in an array around the building to determine whether contaminant levels rise when demolition begins. If so, UCOR workers will add a stabilizing chemical called a fixative, spray more water on the building, or “stop demolition until the levels come down enough,” he added. “The whole idea is to keep from putting more pollutants in the air.”

DOE’s environmental management, or cleanup, mission is a massive, significant and long-term financial liability for the U.S. government, Olds said. But at an estimated cost of $450 billion, it is less of a burden to the federal government than are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the national debt.

“We’re removing a legacy of the past that is also a liability,” Olds concluded. “We are cleaning up the environment not only for the people here today but also for future generations.”","https://www.oakridger.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/03/NOAK/87585153007-oak-ridge-reservation-with-sites-copy.jpg?crop=1768,994,x0,y0&width=1768&height=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-04 11:10:10.057097

The achievement marks a major step forward in OU’s ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.

“Sustainability is one of the core values that guides our university,” said President Pescovitz. “This project demonstrates how Oakland University can lead by example — investing in clean energy solutions that reduce our carbon footprint and inspire future generations to build a more sustainable world. By blending historic preservation with cutting-edge clean energy solutions, Oakland University is showing what’s possible

when tradition meets progress.”

A Landmark Renewable Energy Project

The transformation of Sunset Terrace was made possible through the installation of a 100-kilowatt photovoltaic (PV) solar system, designed and engineered by Michigan Solar Solutions (MSS). The ground-mounted solar array generates approximately 112,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year — enough to supply 100% of the home’s annual energy needs, including heating and cooling through high-efficiency electric heat pumps.

During the summer months, when solar production exceeds the home’s energy consumption, surplus electricity is exported back to the grid through an electric smart meter operated by DTE Energy.

“This is an important milestone for Oakland University,” said Rafi Bayrakdarian, director of engineering and energy for OU Facilities Management. “The Sunset Terrace solar project demonstrates how renewable energy investments can deliver both environmental and financial benefits. The clean energy generated will offset approximately 80 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year — equivalent to removing 20 gasoline-powered vehicles from the road or planting more than 1,200 tree seedlings that grow for a decade.”

Smart Investment, Real Savings

The financial feasibility of the project was strengthened through the Elective Pay option in the Section 48E Energy Investment Tax Credit, part of the federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This program allows tax-exempt institutions like Oakland University to benefit directly from federal clean energy incentives. Through this initiative, Oakland University is expected to receive an estimated $95,000 credit to support the project.

After the credit, the project’s total cost will be $220,000. The project is expected to generate approximately $16,000 in annual energy savings, resulting in a payback period of less than 14 years.

Honoring History While Building a Sustainable Future

Sunset Terrace, completed in 1953, was originally built as the retirement home of Oakland University’s founders and benefactors, Alfred and Matilda Wilson. Designed by architect William Kapp of Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls, the 11,400-square-foot residence exemplifies a prairie-style design inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. With its curvilinear architecture, extensive glasswork, and integration with the surrounding Meadow Brook Estate, Sunset Terrace has long served as a symbol of elegance and hospitality.

Over the decades, the home has hosted notable university leaders, artists, and guests — from the university’s first chancellor, D.B. “Woody” Varner, to world-renowned pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy. Now, with the addition of state-of-the-art solar technology, Sunset Terrace’s legacy continues in a new way — as a beacon of innovation and sustainability.

A Model for Campus Sustainability

The Sunset Terrace solar installation joins a growing list of green initiatives at Oakland University, including energy-efficient building upgrades, campus recycling programs, and sustainability-focused research and coursework. OU’s Facilities Management team continues to explore additional renewable energy projects across campus, helping the university reduce its environmental impact while promoting a culture of sustainability.

“Our goal is to make every project — big or small — contribute to a cleaner, more efficient campus,” Bayrakdarian said. “Sunset Terrace is just one more example of how we’re turning our sustainability goals into tangible results. By harnessing renewable energy at Sunset Terrace, we’re demonstrating Oakland University’s commitment to innovation, environmental stewardship, and a greener future for our campus community.""",https://www.oakland.edu/media/Oakland/template-assets/Header-Footer/Images/og-logo-blk.png,N,,2025-12-04 11:10:25.306477

Arizonans rank the cost of living as the top issue the state government should address, with around 1 in 4 specifically worried about electricity costs.

The survey, conducted with the support of Lincoln Room Strategies and 270 Strategies, comes on the heels of Governor Hobbs’ announcement of the Arizona Energy Promise Task Force, which will focus on lowering energy costs, reducing regulatory burdens and identifying solutions for addressing energy demand across the state.

“Arizonans are feeling strained by rising costs and clearly want more affordable clean power as our state’s electricity needs continue to grow,” said Kevin Moran, Associate Vice President for Regional Affairs at EDF and Member of Governor Hobbs’ new Energy Promise Task Force. “Solar and wind energy offer the fastest and most affordable ways to bring more electricity supply to the grid – and they use less water than fossil fuel projects. Clean energy also creates income opportunities for landowners who lease their land to projects, and it can generate new tax revenue in communities for schools, roads and emergency services.”

The survey of 1,525 respondents was fielded October 30-November 5 and found that Arizonans want fewer restrictions on solar and wind, including bans or limitations on where these projects can be built:

The majority of Arizonans believe that state policies that restrict renewable energy discourage economic growth and end up costing Arizonans more in the long run.

A strong majority (76%), across Democrats, Republicans and Independents, agree that landowners should be able to lease some of their land to solar and wind projects for income, without lawmakers getting in the way.

“The findings underline that Governor Hobbs is rightly focused on unleashing Arizona’s energy potential,” said Moran. “State leaders should find ways to cut red tape around clean energy projects – rather than adding more – to keep electricity costs down and reliably power our homes and growing economy well into the future.”

In August, three Arizona utilities broke records for peak electricity demand – recording the highest-ever electricity usage – amid extreme heat. Arizona utilities estimate significant electricity needs over the next 15 years, largely due to the construction of data centers, with some utilities projecting a 40% increase in peak demand.

Arizona Public Service is asking state regulators to approve a 14% rate increase – about $20 per month – to pay for rising demand. Tucson Electric Power is also seeking a 14% increase, which it says would add about $16 per month.

Governor Katie Hobbs signed Executive Order 2025-13 Removing Barriers to Delivering Affordable Energy for Arizona in September, which established the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce. The Taskforce will create plans to facilitate large-scale economic growth while identifying potential ways to prevent significant increases in Arizonans’ energy costs, expand Arizona’s clean energy economy and use state lands for energy infrastructure.

Meanwhile, building up enough gas and nuclear plants to power data centers may prove too slow and expensive.
With federal subsidies for wind and solar plants ending by 2028, some won’t pencil economically.
Officials could trip up other projects as well, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.
When Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill gutted green energy subsidies, Wood Mackenzie lowered its projection for renewable power plants, but only by 8%.","The Trump administration is moving to fast-track the construction of power-hungry data centers as a matter of national security. At the same time, it’s adding roadblocks for new solar and wind farms.

But the two policies could be at odds: Hindering renewable energy projects risks slowing the AI boom - and could exacerbate rising electricity prices, a slew of data suggests.

“It’s an all-hands-on-deck moment right now to get the power to supply this,” said Robert Whaley, director of North American power at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy. “In the next 10 years, there’s really nothing to replace renewables.”

The AI explosion - and its energy demands - is happening much faster than the pace at which utilities typically plan and build large power plants. In response, tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have taken extreme measures to keep up, cobbling together data centers in tents and signing contracts for their own power plants.

Renewable energy so far remains the fastest and cheapest option to add power to the grid. Nearly 80% of the planned power plant capacity in the pipeline is tied to renewable sources, according to filings with federal regulators and grid operators compiled by Cleanview.co, an energy data company.

The number of applications for natural gas and nuclear facilities, the options President Donald Trump is embracing to power the AI surge, is much smaller, making up about 14% of planned capacity.

The dynamic creates a potential political challenge for Trump, whose goal of using the AI boom as an engine for the American economy risks blowback at the ballot box if voters blame the data centers he's championed for higher power bills.

AI’s voracious need for electricity is likely to keep renewables growing, but every thwarted green energy project means fewer electrons added to the grid to ease the supply crunch, analysts say.

That’s not to say natural gas, the most viable and cheapest of the president’s preferred energy sources, won’t play a role in powering AI: Unlike solar and wind, which are intermittent, gas can provide the large, around-the-clock power supply data centers require. Meta, for example, is relying on the fuel to power its hulking four million-square-foot data center complex in northeastern Louisiana.

And the glut of green power applications can be traced to subsidies afforded through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump administration officials argue meddled in the market and discouraged investment in gas plants.

“President Trump is expanding base load power from reliable energy sources like natural gas, coal and nuclear to support growing electricity demand from AI and data centers,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson. “Intermittent and unreliable energy sources like offshore wind that were propped up by the Green New Scam simply cannot generate the sustained power needed to make the United States the global leader in cutting-edge technologies like AI and quantum computing.”

But the cost to build solar and wind farms plummeted in the years before those incentives were scrapped. Meanwhile, building up enough gas and nuclear plants to power data centers may prove too slow and expensive. Gas turbines, critical equipment to turn natural gas into electricity, are in short supply, and even though Trump is moving to accelerate permitting of the next generation of small-modular nuclear reactors, the next wave of those aren't expected to be built until the end of the decade at the earliest.

A growing mismatch

In the US, power consumption from data centers is expected to nearly triple by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The surge, along with rising demands from manufacturing and electrification, is akin to the US having to power up to 190 million new homes by 2040, according to the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.

Coal probably won’t move the needle much. At this point, power from a new coal plant would cost at least $71 per megawatt-hour of capacity, compared with around $38 for solar or wind, according to Lazard Inc. And they take far longer to build.

Meanwhile, the amount of energy that can be squeezed out of incumbent coal plants - either through increased utilization or delayed retirement - is modest, according to BloombergNEF.

Even after recent policy shifts, including a $625 million grant program to subsidize coal, Wood Mackenzie expects US megawatts from the fuel to decline every year going forward.

Natural gas is more cost competitive at the moment and quicker than coal to build. Gas is tied to 13% of capacity from planned power plants, which are proposed to come online over the next 10 years or so, according to Cleanview.co data. However, that lever can’t be pulled much farther, at least in the short term. Some 70% of the world’s gas turbines come from just three companies; their inventory is largely spoken for over the next decade and they’ve shown little appetite to add capacity.

Nuclear, which Trump is promoting by speeding up regulatory approvals and committing at least $80 billion to develop reactors, is making a comeback, albeit a tiny one.

At this point, battery storage systems, solar arrays and wind farms are faster and cheaper to build per kilowatt of capacity than anything else, according to Lazard.

Most solar, batteries and wind farms don’t require lengthy air-quality permits, and thus take less than five years to complete. Some are built within a year-and-a-half, according to BloombergNEF. The timeline for deploying natural gas plants is three-and-half to five years on average, and will likely grow longer due to supply chain backlogs, it said. Lead times for utility-scale gas-fired plants have stretched by 35%, or more than a year, since 2023, its analysis shows.

It follows that more than nine out 10 power plants in the pipeline - roughly 5,700 facilities - are tied to renewables, according to Cleanview.co.

Cleanview founder and CEO Michael Thomas notes many of those plans were drawn up during Biden’s presidency and ultimately won’t make it to completion. With federal subsidies for wind and solar plants ending by 2028, some won’t pencil economically. Others are placeholders for utilities that will decide later which fuel source to go with.

For example, the largest planned solar complex in North America - a collection of projects called Esmeralda Seven - had its environmental permit review cancelled by the US Interior Department in October. Developers will need to apply for individual approval from an administration that isn’t in favor of big solar projects on federal land.

Officials could trip up other projects as well, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. It estimates that new solar and energy storage projects, which make up more than half of new power plant proposals, haven’t been fully permitted and are at risk.

Still, applications are a measure of intent and the feasibility of various options. Despite the rhetoric from the White House, a lot of renewable projects are likely to get the green light because AI developers are moving so quickly, Thomas said. Indeed, delays for new solar plants are in decline, according to federal data.

“There’s a lot of theater around this - what the Trump administration says and then what it does,” he added. “Things are still getting permitted and built. And people are just trying to fly under the radar.”

The head of one of the biggest renewable energy developers in the US told investors on Nov. 5 that the data center industry still wants clean energy to power its operations.

“Look, that's what can get built in this window,"" said Andres Gluski, CEO of AES Corp. ""There can be talk about nuclear or other technologies; those take years to build. So what is going to meet the majority of the demand? Well, this year it's probably going to be 90% renewables and batteries, and it very likely will be next year as well.""

The big tech companies are signing power contracts with natural gas to get round-the-clock power, but say they are still committed to their clean energy goals. As some hyperscalers sign deals to pipe in natural gas directly into their facilities, they are buying contracts for clean power projects that will result in more renewable energy hitting the grid, according to BloombergNEF analyst Nayel Brihi. In the first half of 2025, Meta, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google contracted for 9.6 gigawatts of clean energy, or the equivalent of 7.2 million homes, to be delivered to the US over the coming years.

Ultimately, the mismatch between the speed at which companies are building data centers and that at which electricity generation is coming online bodes well for renewable energy. When Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill gutted green energy subsidies, Wood Mackenzie lowered its projection for renewable power plants, but only by 8%. By 2034, the company expects US utilities to add another 666 gigawatts of power from solar, storage and wind, compared with just 126 gigawatts of gas-fired electricity.

Whaley, at Wood Mackenzie, doesn’t expect Trump to stop publicly opposing renewable energy. However, away from the microphones, in the thorny weeds of energy policy, he figures conservative policymakers may quietly tolerate a deeper shade of green. Indeed, this year through September, renewable sources comprised 89% of new electrical generating capacity, according to the Energy Information Administration.

“MAGA has to be MAGA; they have to keep the base fired up,” Whaley said. “But privately, I think there will be concessions, because they don’t want to lose the AI race to China.”

2Based on internal Ford data on BlueCruise engagement in the United States between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2024.","Hitting the open road for the holiday season is a trend that continues to grow with more folks opting to travel by car to avoid the hassles of flying.

Last year, AAA projected nearly 90% of holiday travelers would drive to their destination over the year-end holiday period from Saturday, Dec. 21 to Wednesday, Jan. 1.

Increasingly, people are using the weekend before the holidays to get to their destination, whether it’s to go on vacation or over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house.

This was evident in our BlueCruise data from the last two years.1 The Saturday ahead of the week of Dec. 25 (2024) and ahead of Thanksgiving week (2023) were the days with the most miles logged out of the entire year.

Last year, the day with the most miles and hours driven by Ford and Lincoln customers was Saturday, Dec. 21, when 610,000 hands-free highway miles were logged.1 That added up to 8,600 hours spent using BlueCruise that day alone.2

That’s an increase of over 50% from 2023’s peak, which was 400,000 hands-free miles driven on Saturday, Nov. 18, heading into Thanksgiving week.3

This data tells us customers are using the weekend to get to their destination so they can enjoy the full holiday week, and they’re traveling further distances to one destination, perhaps to maximize time with family and friends. For these folks, BlueCruise is providing enhanced comfort on long holiday hauls, helping them arrive refreshed and ready for the festivities.

To give us a glimpse into what we can expect this year, around 84% of Ford owners are planning to use BlueCruise to take a road trip over the holiday season. Of those people who have made their plans already, nearly 30% are planning to head out on Saturday, Dec. 20, according to a voluntary survey of a group of owners with BlueCruise-equipped vehicles.4

Many are traveling across the country, some for annual family gatherings and some to enjoy some quiet time in the mountains. Here are a few tales we’re hearing directly from customers.

Texas to Kansas (95% hands-free highway driving with BlueCruise)

Mike P. is traveling with his wife and yellow lab Patrick to their family’s annual Christmas spectacular, which brings together over 50 people.

“We travel to Kansas every year for the holidays, but this year we are excited to go in our new 2025 Expedition Max Ultimate and use BlueCruise to help make the 7-hour road trip easier,” he said.

Over the week, they’ll enjoy BBQ, a football game, and their annual white elephant gift exchange.

Florida to North Carolina (90%+ hands-free highway driving with BlueCruise)

Ronnie C. is a seasoned road-tripper taking advantage of the holiday break to head north with his family for some time in the mountains and snow.

“We love going on road trips, especially with the F-150 Lightning!” he said. The family takes advantage of the available Wi-Fi® hotspot so the kids can use their tablets to stay entertained on the 8+ hour drive.

“Just recently, we used BlueCruise on a trip to North Carolina to go camping, and it definitely helped relieve some of the stress during the stop-and-go traffic we had to deal with on the highway, so I am looking forward to using it again,” he said. “When we got to our camp site, we also used Pro Power Onboard to power space heaters to keep us warm, cook, and even let the kids enjoy some Xbox.”.

Virginia to Ohio (70%+ hands-free highway driving with BlueCruise)

Cecilio B. just bought a 2025 F-150 Lightning and is headed to Ohio with his wife and son for their annual trip to the family’s farm.

“We just did a quick road trip to Washington, D.C. with BlueCruise and loved it,"" he said. ""I am looking forward to using BlueCruise for the first time on our annual holiday trip since it takes around 9 hours to get there, then enjoying good food and music during the week, since I am a retired chef and my son is a music major.""

The growing demand for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) further suggests this trend isn’t going to slow down. In 2025, hands-free highway driving capability was the most wanted feature for 43% of new vehicle intenders, up 20% since 2024, according to an AutoPacific study.

With over 1 million BlueCruise-equipped vehicles on the road, we anticipate even more folks will opt to use it during the upcoming holidays.

Before we close out the year, check out the hands-free highway driving trends we saw in 2024 across the U.S. from Ford and Lincoln owners. I’m even more excited to see what this year’s data is going to tell us.

The most recent data shows that Britain has the highest industrial energy prices out of any International Energy Agency member country, with prices 46% higher than the IEA median.
For example, when used alongside a heat pump, solar thermal provides the ‘preheat’ for the heat pump.
Manufacturers do not need to wait for grid upgrades or electricity prices to fall to decarbonise.
Heat is the sleeping giant of the energy transition that gives manufacturers more on-site control and financial certainty.","It’s a tough time to be a manufacturer. Whether it’s Trump’s tariffs, supply chain issues raising costs or falling demand, the recent UK Purchasing Manager’s Index reflects the struggles that our manufacturing industry is facing. With this in mind, it’s hardly surprising that more manufacturers are looking to renewable energy to help lower costs and enhance decarbonisation in manufacturing. They’re quite right to think this way.

Natural gas prices are forecast to increase in 2025 and 2026, and the lack of progress in ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine means that the price volatility of the past four years will not cease.

The only way for manufacturers to increase their resilience to price rises is to switch to renewables. The main driver of this so far has been electrification, and the pace of its growth has been staggering. In the first half of this year, the UK produced a record 9.91 TWh through solar power, while gas fell to just 21% of electricity in June.

This will continue to drive net zero, especially for domestic usage, but for manufacturers, the situation is a little bit more complicated.

First, the power system is congested, with long connection queues and uncertain timelines. Queues and constraints are now a business risk. If your plant needs a bigger connection, you could be waiting years, and paying for the privilege.

Second, this congestion isn’t going anywhere, as demand for electricity is set to soar. The National Grid estimates it will rise by 50% by 2035, driven by the adoption of AI, EVs and electric heating systems like heat pumps.

Third, electricity prices for manufacturers are skyrocketing. The most recent data shows that Britain has the highest industrial energy prices out of any International Energy Agency member country, with prices 46% higher than the IEA median.

This is not to say that we shouldn’t continue to invest in clean power. We should – it’s delivered numerous benefits so far, and these will only get bigger.

But the current plans by the National Grid to upgrade its network across the country is set to cost up to £35bn from 2026 to 2031.

What is currently missing is a strategic focus on heat decarbonisation.

In British industry, heat makes up around 70% of total energy demand. Across the whole economy, heat accounts for 37% of the UK’s carbon emissions (17% from space heating and 14% from industrial heat). While electrification has been in focus so far, heat really is the sleeping giant of the transition.

Decarbonising heat quickly and at scale has proven to be very hard for the commercial and industrial sector. For decades they experienced a heavy reliance on natural gas and switching to a technology mix often comes with high capital costs.

In the case of electrification they are faced with the known energy infrastructure constraints, and this dilemma has only been enhanced in the past by uncertainty around policy and regulatory issues.

However, businesses can generate heat directly at the point of use with ‘grid-edge’ renewable heat technologies. These are customer-side solutions that deliver energy without the need to pull power from the grid.

Solar thermal is a good example. Rather than traditional solar PV panels, which generate electricity, solar thermal collectors convert sunlight into heat, which can be stored in hot water tanks for easy usage for industrial processes, domestic hot water as well as space heating.

This has numerous benefits. First, there is significantly less red tape involved with their installation, because they don’t need to join the queue to connect to the grid. In theory, there’s nothing to stop commercial & industrial companies installing solar thermal on their roofs to start decarbonising their heat demand tomorrow.

Second, they are complementary to the existing electrification push, as they make existing electrification efforts more efficient. A large-scale deployment of solar thermal would free up the grid significantly and ensure that precious green electricity is used in the most efficient and responsible way for example to charge EVs and meet the almost unsatisfiable demand of AI data centres.

One key strength of this technology is that it is compatible with a range of other heating technologies and makes these more efficient. For example, when used alongside a heat pump, solar thermal provides the ‘preheat’ for the heat pump. This means it improves the Coefficient of Performance of it, as the heat pump only needs to top up the pre heat to get to the target temperature, which translates to less pressures on the electricity grid.

Finally, these technologies also provide cheaper and more predictable costs. Rather than relying on volatile gas or electricity prices, there are numerous finance vehicles for grid-edge heat technology, such as heat-as-a-Service agreements, that lock in the operational costs of heat for 10 years or longer. This frees up capital which can be invested into other areas of the business.

Electrification will still be the main way of achieving net zero, but it’s becoming clear that it can’t do it alone. Manufacturers do not need to wait for grid upgrades or electricity prices to fall to decarbonise.

Heat is the sleeping giant of the energy transition that gives manufacturers more on-site control and financial certainty. The technologies are proven, the contracts exist, and the payoff is cost, carbon and competitiveness – there’s no need to wait anymore.",http://themanufacturer-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/03150531/TM-Blog-Header-Featured-Image-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:46.931290

Converting momentum into measurable methane reductions Brazil’s new collaboration with CATF and Carbon Mapper demonstrates real momentum toward tackling waste methane.","At COP30, the Government of Brazil announced the launch of a process to develop a first-of-its-kind national initiative to detect and mitigate methane emissions from the country’s waste sector, in collaboration with Clean Air Task Force (CATF), Carbon Mapper, and local partners. The effort will use emerging satellite and remote sensing technologies to identify high-emitting landfill and dumpsite locations and put actionable data into the hands of operators and municipal authorities.

This announcement marks a major step in Brazil’s methane leadership. It also highlights a broader opportunity. The waste sector represents one of the most cost-effective and politically actionable levers for near-term climate progress. As Brazil moves from commitment to implementation, new analysis from CATF and Instituto PNRS offers a detailed view of where policy reform, investment, and capacity building can drive further mitigation.

The waste sector has outsized climate impact and immediate mitigation potential

Methane is responsible for roughly 25 percent of Brazil’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and the waste sector contributes about 15 percent of national methane emissions, driven largely by the decomposition of organic waste in landfills and open dumps.

In 2023, Brazil generated 78 million tons of municipal solid waste, nearly half of which consisted of organic material. Yet only 36 percent of the population has access to separate collection services, and around 26 percent of collected waste continues to be sent to inadequate disposal sites. Approximately 9 percent of waste generated is not collected at all and is burned or dumped illegally.

These conditions make waste methane one of the country’s most concentrated and addressable climate challenges.

New CATF analysis identifies strategic gaps and high-impact opportunities

The Brazilian Waste Sector Methane Analysis, examines national waste generation, emissions, policy frameworks, and institutional capacity, identifying where the biggest opportunities for reduction lie. Key findings include:

Significant infrastructure gaps remain. Brazil still has roughly 2,000 inadequate disposal sites in operation and large regional disparities in access to separate collection and treatment capacity.

Limited enforcement and technical capacity hinder implementation of existing federal mandates, including the National Solid Waste Policy’s requirement to close open dumps.

Data and financial gaps restrict the ability of municipalities to plan and deploy composting, anaerobic digestion, and landfill methane capture.

Near-term mitigation technologies are established and scalable, including landfill gas capture, biocovers, improved landfill operations, and expanded organic waste treatment.

Examples across Brazil show the potential for progress. Brazil’s early experience with landfill gas recovery has already contributed to its first recorded year-over-year decline in solid-waste methane emissions. With strategic investment and implementation support, these reductions can accelerate.

A critical moment for policy reform and targeted investment

Brazil already has a strong policy foundation for waste and methane management, including the National Solid Waste Policy, PLANARES, and the Zero Dumpsites Program. But the report finds that enforcement, financing, and capacity remain uneven, particularly at the municipal level.

The development of the satellite-based initiative announced at COP30 is an important step toward building that capacity-and demonstrating that such a program is possible at the national level-but broader structural reforms will be needed to deliver sustained emissions reductions.

The report recommends several priority actions to strengthen Brazil’s broader waste methane mitigation efforts, including:

Updating and enforcing landfill regulations, including new rules for landfill operations, methane use, and waste segregation at the source

Expanding organic waste diversion and treatment, including composting, mechanical–biological treatment, and anaerobic digestion, supported through targeted policies, public awareness campaigns, and incentives for waste reduction and recycling

Supporting methane capture and energy recovery at sanitary landfills, including the adoption of biocovers and mandatory methane recovery systems where viable

Providing training and technical support for municipal authorities and waste professionals to strengthen operational practices and improve implementation of methane mitigation strategies

Improving data systems, including standardized protocols for methane measurement and systems to monitor emissions across disposal sites

Strengthening financing mechanisms, such as waste-fee systems and public–private partnerships, to help municipalities cover ongoing operational costs and invest in new infrastructure

These steps would help Brazil advance its stated climate targets, improve public health, and strengthen waste services across regions.

WasteMAP provides a foundation for long-term implementation support

The Brazilian assessment is part of a broader series of Waste Sector Methane Analysis reports for Ecuador, Mexico, and Colombia, produced as part of CATF and RMI’s Waste Methane Assessment Platform (WasteMAP). WasteMAP is an open platform that brings together waste methane emissions data with decision-support tools, supported by direct engagement with national and subnational governments, waste sector officials, and other key decision makers. The aim is to build capacity, improve data systems, and help governments accelerate methane mitigation in the waste sector.

Converting momentum into measurable methane reductions

Brazil’s new collaboration with CATF and Carbon Mapper demonstrates real momentum toward tackling waste methane. The Waste Sector Methane Analysis shows, however, that further progress will hinge on empowering municipalities, which are responsible for implementing waste policies, improving collection systems, closing dumpsites, and expanding treatment capacity. With targeted investment and continued national support, Brazil can turn better detection into measurable methane reductions and a stronger, more modern waste systems.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03133426/cop30-brazil-wastemethane.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 14:01:30.461964

The Curtailing Litigation Excess and Abuse Reform Act of 2025, H.R. 6352 / S. 3305, also known as the CLEAR Act, would eliminate excessive litigation against energy projects while maintaining stringent environmental standards.

U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R-OH) sponsored H.R. 6352 while U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) led the identical S. 3305 in his chamber.

“Activist groups have long weaponized our legal system to attack promising energy projects, filing lawsuit after lawsuit to grind progress to a halt. The CLEAR Act puts an end to this serial litigation,” Balderson said. “To unleash American energy, lower costs, and strengthen our energy security, we must restore predictability and common sense to our permitting system.”

If enacted, the CLEAR Act would prevent activist groups from filing serial lawsuits to block projects they oppose ideologically, while still preserving legitimate avenues for oversight and enforcement.

The bill also would ensure that once a court has ruled on an energy project, opponents can’t drag it back into court repeatedly, according to a bill summary provided by the lawmakers.

Additionally, the measure would enable critical energy infrastructure to be built faster by limiting costly delays, helping to create certainty for investors and communities, the summary says.

Exceptions also would be maintained for certain lawsuits after a project is running, and lawmakers said the bill would support energy independence, grid reliability, and access to critical minerals needed for modern technology.

The ecological impact of climate change is no longer a distant warning, but an urgent, real-world challenge—one that calls for solutions that combine technological strength with a sense of responsibility.

Cross-sector Collaboration: Tongwei + WWF

In China’s ongoing push to achieve its dual-carbon goals through renewable energy, Tongwei has positioned itself as a company committed to both solar PV technology and ecological responsibility. The company recently entered into a strategic partnership with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), becoming:

the first private Chinese enterprise to join WWF’s Arctic conservation program, and the first PV manufacturer to enter a long-term climate and energy cooperation with WWF. This sets a new benchmark for the industry.

This groundbreaking collaboration is not only a key step in Tongwei’s global strategy to address ecological challenges, but also an important example of China’s green forces participating in international environmental governance. By integrating WWF’s ecological research expertise with Tongwei’s PV industrial capabilities, the partnership aims to explore replicable models for synergistic development between renewable energy and ecological protection.

Responsibility in Action: World-class PV Manufacturing Strength

Tongwei’s commitment to ecological protection stems from more than 40 years of deep and smart industrial expertise. On the manufacturing side, Tongwei's Meishan Cell Factory No. 4—recognized as the world’s first “Lighthouse Factory” in the PV cell sector—has established a full-process “one cell, one code” traceability system. With AI and big-data applications, the plant achieves lower lifecycle energy consumption and higher operational efficiency, providing verifiable, high-quality assurance for high-performance modules.

On the product side, Tongwei’s TNC 2.0 modules deliver outstanding performance under extreme conditions, with outdoor yields significantly higher than industry averages. The next-generation TNC 3.0 modules further achieve breakthroughs in conversion efficiency, system performance, and lifetime value—emerging as powerful “energy tools” for ecological conservation.

At the cooperation launch event, Liu Shuqi, Chairwoman and CEO of Tongwei Co., stated that advancing the deep integration of green energy and ecological protection is not only a long-term undertaking, but also a solemn commitment to the future.

From full lifecycle carbon-footprint certification to ongoing smart manufacturing innovation, Tongwei is transforming its green manufacturing strength into tangible environmental action.

Technical Validation: From the Plateau to the Arctic

Supported by robust manufacturing capabilities, Tongwei has already tested its products in extreme conditions on the Tibetan Plateau—and is now extending these efforts to the Arctic.

At altitudes over 4,500 meters, Tongwei’s off-grid PV systems have brought clean power to the “Roof of the World.” Since 2018, the company has continuously donated off-grid systems to the “Qinghai–Xizang Green Post Stations.” The TNC (TOPCon) series, with its high cold resistance and excellent reliability, supplies uninterrupted 24-hour electricity to stations such as the Sonam Dargry Protection Station in Hoh Xil and monitoring points in Sanjiangyuan, addressing the persistent issue of inadequate power supply in harsh environments.

Now, this experience is being extended to the Arctic. Tongwei’s partnership with WWF focuses on enhancing the resilience of Arctic ecosystems, jointly conducting environmental monitoring and supporting long-term research on multi-year sea ice distribution and trends. The collaboration also explores mechanisms for harmonious coexistence between humans and the Arctic ecosystem, and promotes sustainable involvement of local communities in conservation efforts.

To ensure effective implementation, the project will advance in phases: enhancing public awareness and engagement on climate issues through multi-channel communication, and leveraging Tongwei’s strong PV industrial capabilities to encourage broader stakeholder participation in systemic climate-change solutions and build societal consensus on biodiversity protection.

Regular evaluations will be conducted to develop reproducible and scalable models, expanding the project’s influence and attracting more cross-sector stakeholders to join in protecting the Arctic ecosystem and supporting global biodiversity.

Value Leadership: Injecting Momentum into Global Ecological Governance

The Tongwei–WWF partnership is not merely a collaboration between a corporation and a global NGO—it is a demonstration of China’s PV industry contributing to global ecological governance.

For the industry, Tongwei’s Lighthouse Factory standards and advanced TNC module technologies have created a unique pathway of “technology reserves – scientific collaboration – ecological protection.” By participating deeply in Arctic scientific research, Tongwei sets an example of how PV enterprises can assume ecological responsibilities.

For the world, Tongwei—representing China’s renewable-energy leadership—is offering an actionable “Chinese approach” to international environmental cooperation through its combination of technological support and global engagement.

More importantly, Tongwei is putting into practice the concept that “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.” As the world confronts the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, Tongwei is lowering the cost of green energy through technological innovation and working with partners worldwide to advance practical and effective conservation actions.",https://www.energytrend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/通威×WWF：用光伏力量为北极续冰.png,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:53.024514

‘A make-or-break moment’

According to the letter, which was penned to Stéphane Séjourné, Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, and Jessika Roswall, Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience, and a Competitive Circular Economy, the European battery industry is experiencing a ‘true make-or-break moment’, which will require ‘strong policies’ to ensure investment certainty.

In the meantime, blocked negotiations only serve to divide both EU member states and the industry.

‘The key objective of the battery carbon footprint should be to capitalise on the increasingly clean EU grid in order to improve the competitive position of EU battery manufacturing as a whole.’

Low-emission grid

Noting that the EU’s electricity grid is at least a fifth greener than that of China, the groups argue that the carbon footprint rules should take advantage of the emissions profile of the grid, with a methodology based on the EU-wide grid average likely to strengthen the position of domestic manufacturers.

National grid averages, however, would ‘distort the internal market’, while power purchase agreements would weaken the comparative advantage of the EU over other regions, they state.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe.

Researchers use different methods to calculate the total cost of ownership, making this a challenging metric to agree on. (Car and Driver published an overview this summer of the factors to watch.)

But there is little debate that the costs of EVs will continue to decrease, even with cuts to subsidies.

Automakers, who think in decade-plus time horizons, can see the way things are going. Each company is making strategic choices about how much to maintain gasoline and hybrid vehicle lineups, even as they know electric drivetrains will dominate the long-term future.

“We think this transition is inevitable, and the automakers that can [best navigate] this transition are the ones that are likely to win the race,” Slowik said. “They stand to win big, both at home, in terms of their domestic manufacturing volumes, and their sales shares relative to other automakers, but then also abroad.”

ICCT is a useful resource for understanding this moment. For starters, check out a Nov. 17 blog post that offers data-backed commentary on U.S. policy.

Any attempt to make predictions carries risk. If you’d asked me a year ago, I would not have guessed that Trump would be able to pass a repeal of the EV tax credits.

The credits largely benefited U.S.-based companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, helping them gain a competitive edge over models assembled in other countries that were not eligible.

It didn’t make sense to remove the tax credits—and do so with such suddenness—except for the odd political reality of this year and the way the debate in Congress was dominated by fiscal hardliners.

But the push and pull of adding or subtracting subsidies will ultimately matter less than larger factors, such as the long-term decline in battery costs and the increase in battery efficiency.

In the meantime, the rough sales numbers are going to continue. Let’s reconvene next year at this time and we’ll have a better sense of what the recovery looks like.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

Farewell NREL. Hello NLR? Longtime readers of this newsletter know that I often rely on data and expertise from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Now I’m going to need to get used to calling it the National Laboratory of the Rockies, following a name change instituted by the Trump administration that I wrote about for ICN. If the name change turns out to be indicative of a shift in mission for this institution, that’s bad news for the United States and the world, according to the people I interviewed.

Low-Income Families in Illinois Are Going Electric for Free: Hundreds of families have benefited from an Illinois program that pays for home electrification, as Kari Lydersen reports for Canary Media. The initiative is part of a 2021 state energy law, and it’s run by electricity utilities. While the program is small in scale, it gives a sense of what will be needed to allow for a shift away from fossil fuels for the current housing stock.

Murdoch-Owned News Outlets Wrongly Blamed Renewable Energy for New Jersey Rate Hikes: The watchdog organization Media Matters analyzed how news outlets owned by Rupert Murdoch went to great lengths to blame renewable energy for high electricity prices in New Jersey ahead of that state’s gubernatorial election. This scapegoating of renewables overlooks several larger factors, including rising electricity demand from data centers, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN.

China Leads on Renewables and EVs: We’ve gotten used to the idea that China has become the world leader in renewable energy and electric vehicles, but the scale of that lead is so large that it’s shocking to see. Data from McKinsey shows China’s growth in market share, including 63 percent of the world’s EV sales, as Amy Harder reports for Axios.

With the GOP holding majorities in both chambers of Congress, Democratic opposition is unlikely to affect the plans from the Transportation Department’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Still, Democrats will try to make their voices heard on the matter.

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), long a champion of the major automakers that call her state home, said the rollback threatens certainty for the industry.

“I think the automobile industry needs certainty. I think they’re tired of being a pingpong ball between administrations. The American industry needs stability,” she told POLITICO’s E&E News.

“All the stakeholders need to be at the table, and we need to not make cars more expensive for people to run. So let’s give stability to the auto industry and not help the oil industry.”

Numerous auto executives, including from Ford Motor and Stellantis, joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce the proposal, including from Ford Motor and Stellantis.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, called the move one of Trump’s “regulatory gifts to his corrupt fossil fuel megadonors.”

“Trump is, yet again, choosing his billionaire buddies over the American people,” he said in a statement. “Thanks to his relentless attacks on cleaner vehicles, thousands of auto workers have lost their jobs, America has lagged back in international competition, and we’ll all be saddled with more pollution, higher costs, and worse vehicles.”

Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, similarly argued Trump is raising costs for drivers.

“The June 2024 [Corporate Average Fuel Economy] standards lowered costs for Americans at the pump, made our air cleaner and more breathable, and reduced pollution to combat climate change,” said Pallone.

Today’s announcement once again shows the Trump Administration is more concerned with lining the pockets of their polluter friends than providing relief to hardworking Americans.”

A number of Republicans attended the White House announement, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who sponsored a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to reduce automaker penalties for violating efficiency rules to $0.

“This is a victory today for consumers. This is a victory for affordability,” Cruz said. “Under Joe Biden and the Democrats, they put mandate after mandate after mandate on cars and trucks and they drove the prices up thousands and thousands of dollars.”

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, agreed.

“By making [cars] more affordable, making them more choice-driven by what families want and need, today is a great day for the American family,” she said.

“Democrats have used many different avenues, from blue state legislation to regulations at the EPA and Department of Transportation, to repeatedly attempt to force a transition to EVs that many Americans don’t want to buy,” Capito said in a statement after the White House event, adding that the standards “placed unnecessary burdens and higher prices on consumers.”

Trump invited to the event a number of lawmakers who currently own auto dealerships or used to, such as Reps. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Roger Williams (R-Texas), and Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio).

The latest call of the EU Innovation Fund has awarded four wind energy manufacturing projects. This is good news for Europe’s energy competitiveness and security. But the Innovation Fund is not yet giving enough support to direct electrification of industrial processes – a key pillar of the Clean Industrial Deal. A new call might change this now.

The European Commission has announced the results of its latest Innovation Fund call. 61 net-zero technology projects will receive funding. Four of them are wind manufacturing projects. They are spread across Europe with one project located in France, Denmark, Sweden and Spain, respectively.

WindEurope member BW Ideol will produce concrete floating foundations in Fos-sur-Mer, France. Two start-ups – Modvion and Voodin – will produce wind turbines more sustainably, using wooden towers and wooden rotor blades.

This is good news. The Commission continues to back wind manufacturing and secure Europe’s technological edge. The Innovation Fund must remain a tool to scale up wind manufacturing. Not only by upgrading existing facilities, but also by supporting new sites for clean technologies.

More support for electrification needed

Direct electrification of industrial processes is vital to decarbonise Europe’s industry. It is a core element of the Clean Industrial Deal. Europe is not doing enough to electrify its economy. Electrification rates have been flatlining at below 25%.

But the Innovation Fund’s general calls do not work well for electrification projects. These projects attract far less Innovation Fund support than technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen. In the last call, electrification projects got less than 3% of the available funding. This needs to change. Direct electrification is the cheapest and most efficient way to decarbonise Europe.

The Commission has now launched the Industrial Heat Auction, a new pilot mechanism with a €1bn budget for its pilot auction. It specifically targets the electrification of industrial process heat. The pilot Auction will be an important test case for the upcoming Industrial Decarbonisation Bank (IDB), expected in 2026, future funding model. The IDB is an EU financing instrument set to mobilise €100 billion for industrial decarbonisation through tools like carbon contracts and blended finance. If the pilot auction for industrial heat works, it can set the model for the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank next year. The Bank must focus on electrification.

Next calls open

The first Industrial Heat Auction and the 2025 general Innovation Fund calls – including clean tech manufacturing – are now open. Deadline for the auction is 19 February 2026. The deadline for applications for the general calls is 23 April 2026.

On 13 January 2026, WindEurope will host a members-only webinar on the general call.

Background:

The EU Innovation Fund supports innovative low-carbon technologies to help Europe reach climate neutrality by 2050. It has a €40bn budget for 2020-2030, funded with the revenues from the EU’s Emission Trading System (ETS). Since 2020, 14 wind energy projects have received at least €475m from the Fund.",https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/wind-turbines-workers-hanging-yellow-vest-16-9.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 12:01:07.556113

Currently, LONGi possesses leading technologies in PV and hydrogen energy – with its HIBC cell efficiency reaching 27.81% and its ALK electrolyser capacity ranking first globally. This expansion into energy storage signifies the further enhancement of LONGi’s strategic layout, fully forming a closed-loop across the entire “Solar-Storage-Hydrogen” value chain.

Breaking new ground with “ultimate safety”: reshaping the logic of competition in energy storage

Energy storage is a crucial piece in the renewable energy system, and the industry is shifting from policy-driven to market-driven growth. Dennis She pointed out, “The current development stage of the energy storage industry is very similar to the early days of solar — confidence-driven rapid growth, but also bringing disorderly competition. The future dimension of competition in energy storage has evolved from ‘having the technology’ to ‘value reliability.'” He emphasised: ”Safety, reliability, and stability are the yardsticks for measuring energy storage solutions, and are also the cornerstone for winning the long-term trust of the market and customers.”

To uphold the value proposition of “Ultimate Safety”, LONGi has chosen to engage in deep collaboration with PotisEdge, an expert in energy storage safety. Adhering to a three-pillar technical architecture of “intrinsic safety, active defence, and intelligent early warning,” and through its fully self-developed “5S” energy storage system with unique BMS and iCCS designs, PotisEdge has maintained a safety record of “zero thermal runaway” incidents across more than 12GWh of cumulative energy storage and power battery systems over the past decade. This will provide solid technical support for LONGi’s energy storage solutions.

Establishing the first Solar-Storage Technology Innovation Centre in Europe

To accelerate Europe’s energy transition, LONGi officially announced the establishment of its first Solar-Storage Technology Innovation Centre (Centre of Excellence, CoE) in Europe. This centre will integrate core functions including project consulting, technical training, O&M support, and spare parts services, dedicated to providing European customers with rapid-response, full-lifecycle, localised professional services, comprehensively ensuring the safety, reliability, and long-term returns of integrated solar-storage assets.

Choosing London for this global strategy launch underscores LONGi’s high regard for the European market. “Europe’s urgent need for energy transition and its mature market mechanisms provide an ideal platform for practising integrated ‘Solar-Storage-Hydrogen’ solutions,” She said during the launch. The LONGi Energy Storage Solution will be deployed first in key markets such as the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain, helping utilities and power companies build smarter and more efficient clean energy systems. In the future, LONGi will continue to explore viable pathways for the global zero-carbon transition through its “Solar-Storage-Hydrogen” integration strategy, working hand-in-hand with all parties towards a sustainable future powered by renewable energy.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_PR-photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:58.228543

With an installed capacity of 913 MW, it will become by far the largest offshore wind farm in Ørsted’s German portfolio. Borkum Riffgrund 3 shows the breadth of the European offshore wind supply chain as the project has been constructed using wind turbines and foundations from Germany and Denmark, cables from Germany and France, and installation vessels from the Netherlands and Belgium.

The renewable electricity from Borkum Riffgrund 3, which has now started to flow into the German grid, will, through several long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs), help industry and technology customers decarbonise their business. The offshore wind farm is expected to be fully commissioned in Q1 2026.

Patrick Harnett, Chief Construction Officer at Ørsted, said:

“Offshore wind will play a key role in securing European energy independence and manufacturing jobs. Borkum Riffgrund 3 is a prime example of both. The project has been constructed by European companies, creating local manufacturing jobs. And, once completed, it will produce the same amount of electricity that a large city uses every year, supporting European industry with a significant amount of green energy through CPPAs. At Ørsted, we’re proud to deliver the first electrons to the grid, and we look forward to having Borkum Riffgrund 3 fully up and running.”

Jordi Francesch, Managing Director Renewable Energy Investments at Nuveen Infrastructure, said:

“The generation of the first power at Borkum Riffgrund 3 is both a significant landmark for German offshore wind and our commitment to accelerating the EU energy transition. Our partnership with Ørsted will deliver 913 MW of clean energy to German households and European corporates making this project a new benchmark for decarbonisation while also supporting long-term energy security for Germany and the EU.”

Felix Gschnell, Programme Director for Borkum Riffgrund 3, at Ørsted adds:

“With first power produced at Borkum Riffgrund 3, we’re taking a major step towards completion of this large-scale project. Our team and suppliers did a tremendous job getting us to this point, and I’m very grateful for their firm dedication and continuous motivation since we took the final investment decision. We’re now focused on commissioning all remaining wind turbines – so we can start full commercial operation in Q1 2026, thereby contributing a significant amount of additional electricity from offshore wind to the German grid.”

Borkum Riffgrund 3 is located about 72 km off the coast in the German North Sea and covers an area of approx. 75 km². A total of 83 wind turbines, each with a rated capacity of 11 MW, have been installed at the offshore wind farm. Furthermore, Borkum Riffgrund 3 is the first offshore wind farm to be built by Ørsted in Germany without an offshore substation (OSS). The new connection concept provides a direct connection between the wind turbines via a 66 kV connection to the DolWin epsilon offshore converter platform, installed and operated by the German transmission system operator, TenneT.

Powering decarbonisation efforts for corporate offtakers

Borkum Riffgrund 3 is supported by several long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPA), which Ørsted has signed with industrial and technology customers. Offtake agreements totalling 786 MW have been entered into with Amazon (350 MW), BASF (186 MW), Covestro (100 MW), Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft/REWE Group (100 MW), and Google (50 MW). The contracts range from 10 to 25 years in duration. The agreements create long-term price security for the project developer and for the customers.

Ørsted's strong offshore wind generation portfolio in Germany

Earlier this year, Ørsted and Nuveen Infrastructure’s other jointly owned offshore wind farm, Gode Wind 3, was fully commissioned, producing enough renewable energy to power the equivalent of 250,000 homes in Germany. The project is located close to Ørsted’s existing wind farms: Borkum Riffgrund 1 and 2 and Gode Wind 1 and 2. With these recent additions, Ørsted's installed offshore wind power capacity in Germany increases to around 2.5 GW in early 2026 – or the equivalent of 2.5 million homes powered. Ørsted is the market leader in Germany, operating over 20 % of the country’s total offshore wind capacity. Operation and maintenance for all Ørsted’s German offshore wind farms is carried out from Norden-Norddeich and Emden in East Frisia.

The Grand Coulee Dam holds a mind-boggling 11,975,521 cubic yards of concrete. This makes it three times larger in terms of concrete used than the renowned Hoover Dam. The monumental dam spans 5,223 feet in length and ranges from 450-500 feet in width at the foundation and 30 feet in width at the crest. This marvel of engineering took shape in various phases from 1933 through 1975.

There are four different power plants in the dam, with 33 generators altogether working in synchronization to create power on such a vast scale. The Left Power Plant and the Right Power Plant consist of nine generators measuring 125 megawatts each in capacity, and the Third Power Plant consists of six generators with capacities from 600-805 megawatts in size.

Grand Coulee Dam’s average yearly power production is 21 billion kWh, with power distributed to Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.

Enormous penstocks carry massive water volumes to generation units

The biggest penstocks in the Third Power Plant are 40 feet in diameter and can handle 35,000 cubic feet of water per second. The gigantic water pipes are more than twice the average annual flow rate of the Colorado River. This indicates the tremendous mass of water that needs to be processed in the system in order to produce abundant, clean electricity.

Total generating capacity reaches 6,809 megawatts, producing 21 billion kWh

The combined electricity-generating capacity of the dam stands at 6,809 megawatts. This results in the average annual generation of 21 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year. This generation capacity makes Grand Coulee Dam one of the biggest in the world and generates 35 percent of the entire power requirements of the Pacific Northwest region.

The power distribution does not end there but extends beyond the boundaries of America. Canada gets substantial electricity through the Columbia River Treaty. The power distribution system operates in Canada in conjunction with other power-generating stations through the Columbia River system. The project belongs to and operates in conjunction with other power-generating projects under the federal system in Canada.

Distribution network

Serves 11 states, including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and California

Provides enough electricity for two cities the size of Seattle

Operates as a baseload renewable energy source

Multiple purposes beyond power generation create comprehensive benefits

Although hydroelectric power accounts for only 79.7 percent of the Grand Coulee Dam’s power use, this project also has significant irrigation and flood control functions that benefit the overall regional economy. The Columbia Basin Project irrigates 720,000 acres of land via 330 miles of main distribution canals and 2,000 miles of lateral channels in the region.

The flood control capacity of the dam protects significant population centers such as Portland in the state of Oregon and Vancouver in the state of Washington through various strategic storage projects under this system. The other benefits that reinforce the economy include irrigated agriculture, power production from water, flood damage prevention, and water recreation.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/premium_photo-1713375115181-edb9c7e7b379.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:10:29.168818

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that the new Trump proposed standards, which will exclude electric vehicles, will achieve an average fuel economy of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, effectively returning to what was in place during Trump’s first term.
The standards revision comes nearly a year after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered the NHTSA to immediately start rulemaking around rescinding or replacing what are called the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars, SUVs and heavy-duty pickups and vans.
The Biden fuel economy standards set forth by the NHTSA reported the rule would save Americans more than $23 billion in fuel costs while also reducing pollution.
“The cure for pollution and high gas costs is strong fuel economy standards, not killing them as a favor to the president’s Big Oil, Big Auto and OPEC golf buddies,” Becker said.","The Trump administration unveiled a significant rollback of the Biden administration’s national fuel economy standards on Wednesday to make it easier for automakers to build and sell gas-powered cars.

The termination would undo standards put in place by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 that now require carmakers to average 50.4 miles per gallon across their passenger cars and light trucks by the 2031 model year.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that the new Trump proposed standards, which will exclude electric vehicles, will achieve an average fuel economy of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, effectively returning to what was in place during Trump’s first term.

The repeal of the Biden-era standards, which will trigger a lengthy rulemaking process, is intended to reduce production costs for American automakers and curb costs for new car customers, President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office. He was joined by executives from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, who thanked him for proposing the repeal.

“It was ridiculous, very expensive, it put tremendous upward pressure on car prices,” Trump said Wednesday. “Today we’re taking one more step to kill the green new scam.”

But opponents of the measure say repealing fuel economy standards will raise costs for drivers and slash progress made in reducing dangerous air pollution that causes tens of thousands of premature deaths annually across the country, research shows. It’s expected that consumer advocates and transportation experts will present oral and written testimony to oppose any cuts to current standards during the proposed rulemaking’s public comment period.

Gina McCarthy, a former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator and White House national climate advisor, said rolling back these standards not only creates more pollution but will enable China to overtake the U.S. auto industry in the global car market through dominance in electric vehicle manufacturing.

“If there’s one thing you can count on, it’s that this administration will never act in the best interest of our health or the environment,” McCarthy stated on Wednesday. “The rest of the world will continue to innovate and create cleaner cars that people want to buy and drive, while we’re forced to sit in our clunkers, paying more for gas and pumping out more tailpipe emissions.”

But major U.S. automakers are grateful for the rollback. Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the company appreciated the administration’s realignment with “real world market conditions” as part of the administration’s wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry. Ford CEO Jim Farley said repealing the standards was the right move for a lot of reasons.

“Today is a victory for common sense and affordability,” Farley said. “We were number two last year in EV sales, we were number three in hybrids and we’re the leading brand for combustion. We believe that people should be able to make a choice.”

The rollback will allow Ford to invest in more affordable vehicles in the U.S., Farley said.

The standards revision comes nearly a year after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered the NHTSA to immediately start rulemaking around rescinding or replacing what are called the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars, SUVs and heavy-duty pickups and vans. Federal law mandates improved gas mileage for American vehicles.

In June, the NHTSA said the prior administration wrongly considered electric vehicles when establishing future mileage requirements. Duffy said that federal law considers only combustion engines in establishing fuel standards, and that by including electric vehicles and hybrid cars, the Biden administration created a standard that combustion engine cars could not attain and required the carmakers to trade for carbon credits.

“These rules are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and [former transportation secretary Pete] Buttigieg want them to build,” Duffy said.

The proposed standards would also eliminate the CAFE credit trading program starting in model year 2028, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. The agency said the credit system allowed companies with large EV lineups to generate and sell excess credits, effectively subsidizing EV manufacturers while increasing compliance costs for companies producing gas-powered vehicles.

EVs’ market share in the U.S. is expected to remain at 8 percent through 2026, the same as it was in 2024, according to a recent forecast from AutoPacific, a research firm. It’s a decrease from the firm’s estimate last year, when it predicted that the market share for EVs would reach 11 percent in 2025 and 15 percent in 2026.

The Biden fuel economy standards set forth by the NHTSA reported the rule would save Americans more than $23 billion in fuel costs while also reducing pollution.

Jason Schwartz, the legal director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, said rescinding these standards will not only cost consumers at the pump, but weaken the nation’s vulnerability to gas price shocks. “NHTSA’s proposed repeal will further pinch the wallets of consumers who are already stretched thin,” Schwartz said in a statement.

The move to dismantle these requirements is the latest in a broader effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden climate and environmental regulations and undo policies Trump said has resulted in an “EV mandate.”

Trump has also called for eliminating subsidies and other measures boosting electric vehicles, stripped federal tax credits from EV purchasers and sought to revoke California’s long-standing ability to set its own emission limits.

The administration has also proposed repealing the 2009 endangerment finding, which would rescind all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines. The endangerment finding is a formal declaration by the EPA, later affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. The finding allows for greenhouse gases to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the country’s primary federal law to control air pollution.

If the endangerment finding is ultimately repealed, it would be the largest deregulatory action in American history, according to the EPA.

Congress first established the CAFE standards in 1975 largely in response to the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, when the average vehicle got about 13 miles to the gallon. These standards are often credited for reducing American reliance on imported oil and driving investments into domestic manufacturing of more efficient vehicle models.

Strong auto standards are the most effective way to cut pollution and oil use, said Dan Becker, the director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. The U.S. is the world’s biggest consumer of oil—consuming 20 percent of the world’s petroleum.

“The cure for pollution and high gas costs is strong fuel economy standards, not killing them as a favor to the president’s Big Oil, Big Auto and OPEC golf buddies,” Becker said. “Trump’s action will feed America’s destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2249775210-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:36.649578

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s longterm strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, costeffective power to our customers.
Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement.
Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience.
“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” May said.","Entergy Louisiana broke ground in Richland Parish to mark the start of construction on a pair of new combined-cycle combustion turbine generation facilities recently approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

The Franklin Farms Power Station represents a significant investment in modern energy infrastructure designed to strengthen reliability, power economic expansion in north Louisiana, and deliver significant economic benefits -- including billions in capital investment, thousands of construction and technology jobs, and lasting value for local communities and Entergy customers statewide.

The project underscores Entergy Louisiana’s commitment to delivering modern, efficient and dependable energy solutions for the state’s communities, industries and digital future. Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 megawatts of highly efficient natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are part of a new expedited interconnection study process to ensure Louisiana can meet the speed to market needed in a powerfirst world.

“This project reinforces what we are seeing across Louisiana: when we modernize our energy infrastructure, we unlock growth for every region of our state,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Under Governor Landry’s leadership, we are strengthening reliability, powering innovation and creating the conditions for long-term economic opportunity. Entergy’s investment demonstrates the value of partnership and the competitive advantage Louisiana brings to a power-first economy.”

The new CCCT facilities will feature modern, highly efficient technology that uses less fuel to produce more power, resulting in lower emissions and improved system reliability. This next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s longterm strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, costeffective power to our customers. By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future,” Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May said. “I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project.”

Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell called the ground breaking, “truly a bright day for northeast Louisiana.”

“I am glad to help play a small part in this economic opportunity,” Campbell said.

Meta’s new, state-ofthe- art data center is one of the largest investments in the region’s history and is expected to support over 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs (once completed) and long-term economic opportunities to the state. These new generation facilities will play a critical role in supporting this development, but also ensuring all of Entergy’s customers have access to reliable, resilient, and sustainable power.

Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement. By aligning energy infrastructure with digital growth, the partnership strengthens Louisiana’s position as a hub for datadriven industries while promoting cleaner, more efficient energy use.

Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10 percent and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta’s contributions toward Entergy’s system costs -- including storm recovery -- are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, helping keep bills lower across Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers. In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide.

Beyond powering Louisiana’s economic growth, these projects will deliver lasting benefits to local communities through job creation, increased tax revenues, and enhanced system reliability. Construction and long-term operation of the new facilities will generate significant economic activity in Richland Parish and surrounding areas, while improved grid performance will reduce outages and support future business expansion.

“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” May said. “Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana’s energy future -- one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.”

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.",https://st2.4media.com/a93/data/wysiwig/favicon-16x16.png,N,,2025-12-04 12:02:04.360051

Looking ahead, the challenges confronting the U.S. energy sector are intensifying.
These factors are expected to add 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of new natural gas demand by 2030.
They’re commonsense changes that benefit all forms of energy — natural gas, nuclear, renewables (i.e., wind, solar), and transmission alike.
Wind and solar projects face the same kinds of delays as oil and natural gas infrastructure do.","Imagine opening your power bill and seeing it going down instead of up. Imagine filling up your truck for less, heating your home without worry, and knowing your job at the factory is secure because America is building again.

Picture an America that leads the world in AI, advanced manufacturing, and military strength — powered by the country’s own abundant energy. Imagine America building power plants faster than China. This is the future that Americans want and deserve, and the single greatest obstacle standing in the way is a broken permitting system that keeps shovels idle instead of breaking ground.

Project delays have real consequences for the American people. When a proposed pipeline or transmission line gets trapped in endless reviews, families pay more at the pump and the meter because projects that otherwise meet every safety and environmental standard languish in agency review for years. Factory jobs vanish or move overseas, data centers fuel China’s tech boom instead of the United States’ and the country’s national security is undermined.

The contrast with global competitors is stark: in 2024 alone, China added 429 GW of electricity capacity — nearly nine times the U.S. total of 48.6 GW — building faster and at continental scale while America remains constrained by process. There is an alarming mismatch between soaring demand and stalled infrastructure. U.S. natural gas demand surged 56 percent from 2010 to 2022, yet pipeline capacity grew only 27 percent and storage just 12 percent over that period, driving prices higher and risking reliability.

Looking ahead, the challenges confronting the U.S. energy sector are intensifying. As highlighted in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC) recently released 2024-2025 Winter Reliability Assessment, multiple regions across the United States face elevated risks of energy shortfalls. This growing vulnerability underscores the urgency of the situation, with electricity demand in 2026 projected to increase 5 percent from 2024 — driven by the rapid expansion of AI data centers, a resurgence in domestic manufacturing, and ongoing residential development.

These factors are expected to add 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of new natural gas demand by 2030. Presently, power generation accounts for more than 42 percent of total U.S. natural gas consumption, and the resulting infrastructure constraints to end markets are contributing to price volatility and reliability concerns. Without accelerated infrastructure development, households and businesses will continue to face escalating costs and risks associated with these permitting bottlenecks.

Permitting reform is about your wallet, your job, your kids’ future, and the United States remaining number one. It’s how America wins the AI and technology race, powers reindustrialization, lowers energy bills, fuels the factories and supercomputers that will drive innovation and secure the nation’s defense, and show the world America is in charge of its own destiny.

Significant steps have already been taken to reinvigorate the energy industry. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is taking steps to move energy infrastructure forward, with its recent move to consider streamlining certain LNG approvals being the latest example.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical shocks, U.S. LNG exports became Europe’s top supplier as Russia’s gas share fell from 40 percent in 2021 to 18 percent in 2024. The U.S. could do more, but permitting delays are making it harder. Meaningful reform across all agencies is the next decisive step.

That’s the why. And recently, the National Petroleum Council (NPC) delivered the how.

“Bottleneck to Breakthrough: A Permitting Blueprint to Build,” the report requested by Secretary Chris Wright, is an actionable blueprint to fix the permitting system — grounded in our practical real-world experience.

The recommendations lay out immediate, common-sense reforms that cut red tape without cutting corners on safety or the environment.

Refocus NEPA on direct project-related effects, not speculative impacts. Curb activist lawsuits from holding approved projects hostage for years. Keep extraneous issues like climate change outside of state water quality reviews and enforce the one-year review period in federal law. Modernize FERC proceedings to green-light essential expansions quickly and enforce 90-day final decisions and create a reimagined pathway for linear infrastructure: if a qualified project meets clear standards upfront, it moves — full speed ahead, with continuous monitoring instead of redundant case-by-case reviews.

These ideas shouldn’t be political. They’re commonsense changes that benefit all forms of energy — natural gas, nuclear, renewables (i.e., wind, solar), and transmission alike. Wind and solar projects face the same kinds of delays as oil and natural gas infrastructure do. Streamlined permitting will accelerate deployment of every energy source.

Making government work better in response to rising demand should unite red states and blue, rural families and urban factories — because every form of energy needs to be built. Far from lowering standards, faster permitting accelerates genuine environmental progress by enabling cleaner, more efficient infrastructure to come online sooner, replacing aging assets with state-of-the-art systems.

The roadmap is clear. By acting decisively — building on the momentum already underway — we can lower utility bills, power American reindustrialization, win the AI and technology race against China and deliver abundant, affordable energy for generations to come. The choice is simple: keep paying more while adversaries surge ahead, or fix permitting and unleash the greatest energy comeback in history.

Now is the time to unleash American energy. Let’s build.

Cooperative federalism has been a cornerstone of Clean Water Act implementation and the agency’s proposed WOTUS rule at last fulfills that commitment to real, shared federal and state responsibility, the EPA said.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a proposed rule revising the regulatory definition of “waters of the U.S.” intended to resolve the regulatory uncertainty regarding the scope of federal jurisdiction.

The agencies are soliciting comments on the proposed rule, which are due 45 days from the proposed rule’s publication in the Federal Register.

The proposal, released Nov. 17, aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court’s Sackett vs. EPA decision that limits Clean Water Act protections to wetlands with a continuous surface connection to navigable waters.

The agencies developed this proposed WOTUS rule using input from multiple sources, including a pre-proposal recommendations docket, information from nine public listening sessions and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Key proposed revisions include:

• Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent.

• Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow.

• Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year.

• Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources.

• Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems; adding a new exclusion for groundwater.

• Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

• In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

“When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“We applaud EPA and the Corps’ efforts to bring our nation’s job creators one step closer to relief from years of federal government overreach by offering a clear, durable ‘Waters of the U.S.’ rule. WAC strongly endorses the agencies’ commitment to respect the legal boundaries articulated by the Supreme Court and to restore the balance Congress intended more than 50 years ago when it enacted the Clean Water Act,” said the Waters Advocacy Coalition in a statement.

“The Waters Advocacy Coalition represents America’s job creators who deliver the services families rely on every day, from producing energy, building homes and infrastructure to growing food. These industries need regulations they can understand. We look forward to more closely analyzing the proposal and offering comments to ensure that this rule protects America’s waterways while offering certainty to landowners throughout the country.”

“Clean water is a top priority for farmers and ranchers. We depend on it. We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines. We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity. We look forward to providing comments to EPA to ensure farmers can continue to safeguard the environment while growing the food America’s families rely on.”

“The agency’s proposed definition of WOTUS would fully implement the court’s direction by focusing on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water — such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes — and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies,” said the EPA in a news release.

“It will accelerate economic prosperity by revising, for example, exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems and by adding an exclusion for groundwater. The proposal also takes into account seasonal and geographic variability by including waters that flow uninterrupted throughout the wetter months in the proposed definition of ‘relatively permanent’ waters, based on pre-proposal feedback.”

This proposal recognizes that states and tribes know their local land and water resources best, the EPA said. The proposed definition of WOTUS protects water quality by affirming federal protections where appropriate and supporting the role of states and tribes as primary regulators managing their own land and water resources.

Cooperative federalism has been a cornerstone of Clean Water Act implementation and the agency’s proposed WOTUS rule at last fulfills that commitment to real, shared federal and state responsibility, the EPA said.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/Ij32dgxU6MdH-T9Eja92QkUYsR4=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/KVD5RX7JQZDVFK56LD55AONSLU.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:10:20.493309

The facility supports Scout’s upcoming Traveler and Terra models and expands the brand’s sourcing network ahead of 2027 production.

A new joint venture between global suppliers Sodecia and Aapico will invest $120 million in a 400,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Orangeburg, South Carolina, to produce ladder frames for Scout Motors.

State officials announced the project on Tuesday, calling it a significant addition to the region’s expanding automotive supply chain. Construction is expected to finish in 2027, and the plant is projected to create up to 392 jobs.

The facility will support Scout Motors’ production center in Blythewood, located about 60 miles north of Orangeburg. Scout plans to begin preproduction builds in 2026 and start full output in late 2027. The new Orangeburg plant will play a central role in that launch by supplying ladder frames for the upcoming Scout Traveler SUV and Terra pickup. Both vehicles are being engineered on a body-on-frame platform explicitly designed for the revived brand.

Local officials say the joint venture strengthens the county’s position as an automotive manufacturing hub. Leaders expect the project to attract additional suppliers as Scout Motors expands its operations and more companies invest across the Midlands. The long-term economic ripple effect is likely to extend beyond the nearly 400 direct jobs created at the new facility.

Sodecia, headquartered in Portugal, and Aapico, based in Thailand, first announced the joint venture in May. Industry analysts note that the partnership allows both companies to share financial risk as new EV and extended-range platforms enter the market without federal incentives. Scout’s decision to use a ladder frame structure aligns with its heritage-inspired product strategy, positioning the vehicles directly in competition with established off-road models.

The new supplier is the latest addition to Scout’s growing component network. American Axle and Manufacturing will provide front electric drive units and rear e-Beam axles for the Traveler and Terra. Scout will also use a Volkswagen facility in Mexico to build the engine that will serve as the range extender for its extended-range electric system.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12042025-Scout-Motors-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:11:06.348488

When asked by Global Witness why it could not name Equinor during its meeting with, Shell declined to comment.
However, Equinor will contribute its £1.3 billion UK ‘tax shelter’ - or credits that can be used against paying future UK taxes.
Global Witness asked Shell whether it intentionally hid from the government that tax dodging was a primary motivation for the deal.
UK tax law prohibits one company from buying another mainly for its trading losses or ‘loss buying’.","Meeting records, obtained through Freedom of Information request, reveal that the oil and gas giant kept quiet on one of the central motivations for the merger – the potential for a £1.3 billion tax dodge – despite being asked explicitly by DESNZ Secretary of State Ed Miliband about the reasons behind the deal.

Adura, the name of the new joint venture between Shell and Equinor, formally launched this week. Campaigners, however, are calling on HMRC and the Chancellor to investigate the deal over tax implications and whether it violates tax rules around ‘loss-buying’.

Recent North Sea mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity – of which Shell and Equinor’s Adura deal is just one example – were cited by the OBR as one of the main reasons why tax revenue from oil and gas is set to be £2.5 billion lower this year than the fiscal watchdog predicted in March.

Global Witness senior fossil fuel investigator Jonathan Noronha-Gant said:

“These records show Shell kept government in the dark about what it really wanted from its new North Sea oil venture, dodging £1.3 billion in tax to the public purse.

“We now need an urgent investigation into this huge oil giant tax dodge. Taxpayers should rightly question why they pay tax while a dubious deal by two mega-wealthy fossil fuel firms can escape HMRC scrutiny.

“The UK government has the authority and should investigate the deal urgently to prove that it’s not one rule for families and another for big polluters.”

Lauren MacDonald, lead campaigner at Stop Rosebank said:

“The oil and gas industry likes to complain about the amount of tax they have to pay, but the Adura deal shows how good they are at gaming the system to increase their profits.

“The creation of Adura doesn’t just tinker with the amount of tax Shell has to pay, this is serious money – money that could be invested in public services, in helping to bring down everyone’s energy bills, in helping energy workers move into clean energy jobs. Instead, it will go to Shell executives and its shareholders.

“When you hear an oil giant complain about taxes, just remember the £1.3bn tax dodge that Shell is attempting to pull off with Adura.”

Robin Wells, director of Fossil Free London said:

“Last year, Shell paid zero tax on North Sea drilling - but instead received £12.4 million back from the government.

“And for years Shell's executives have rubbed their hands over the enormous tax breaks served up by the UK government. Now, please sirs, Shell and Equinor want some more. Only Fagin and Bill Sikes could create a dodgier joint enterprise.'

Tax savings not disclosed

Meeting records that Global Witness obtained through FOI reveal that Shell held high-level discussions with DESNZ Secretary Miliband and Chancellor Rachel Reeves last year prior to externally communicating the deal.

When Miliband explicitly asked Shell why it was doing the deal, the oil giant omitted any mention of tax benefits. Instead, meeting records show the company cited aging North Sea operations, wanting to effectively “combine skills and expertise”, and that the deal was “more a strategic look at [the company’s] portfolio than anything specific”.

Shell also told Miliband it could not say which other company it was merging with – information Global Witness says may have allowed the government to determine the deal’s tax implications.

When asked by Global Witness why it could not name Equinor during its meeting with, Shell declined to comment.

DESNZ staff also raised concerns about whether the Shell merger would lead to job losses. They were assured that there was an “expectation that jobs not [would not be] impacted”. The company also said its deal was not driven by any polices of the current government.

As a result, meeting records appear to suggest DESNZ agreed to speak positively about the deal and agreed common talking points with Shell.

£1.3 billion tax shelter

Adura, which was first announced in December of last year, will merge Shell and Equinor’s UK offshore drilling operations, with each company owning 50% of the joint venture.

This includes Shell’s licences that produce large volumes of oil and gas. Equinor’s production is small and rapidly decreasing. However, Equinor will contribute its £1.3 billion UK ‘tax shelter’ - or credits that can be used against paying future UK taxes.

Global Witness asked Shell whether it intentionally hid from the government that tax dodging was a primary motivation for the deal. Again, the company provided no comment.

UK tax law prohibits one company from buying another mainly for its trading losses or ‘loss buying’. It is unclear whether these restrictions would apply to Adura. However, In November, Global Witness, Stop Rosebank, Fossil Free London, and Tax Justice UK called on HMRC to investigate whether Adura violates tax prohibitions around loss-buying and to bar them from inheriting these assets if this is the case.

It is the engine of electricity generation, the indispensable feedstock for key manufacturing sectors, the hidden pillar of nearshoring competitiveness, and the practical bridge in Mexico’s path toward a cleaner energy future. Yet it is also, paradoxically, the country’s greatest strategic weakness. Mexico imports more than 70% of its natural gas from the United States, one of the highest levels of energy import dependency anywhere in the world for an economy of Mexico’s size.

This article is not simply a technical analysis of natural gas markets. It is an invitation to reflect on Mexico’s strategic direction and its moment of decision because the next two years will determine much more than supply flows or price signals, they will define the contours of Mexico’s role within North America, the resilience of its industrial development, and the credibility of its energy governance. This is a decisive moment. And it demands clarity, urgency and leadership.

A New Era

Mexico is entering a new era of institutional restructuring. The creation of the National Energy Commission, the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Sector Law, and the repositioning of various regulatory bodies mark an ambitious attempt to recalibrate the country’s energy architecture. The intent is to consolidate planning, standardize regulatory processes, eliminate duplicative mandates, and build a more coherent governance structure capable of responding to 21st-century energy demands.

These reforms signal an acknowledgment of a truth long recognized by industry observers: Mexico’s energy institutions had become burdened by overlapping responsibilities, inconsistent regulatory interpretation, delays in permitting, and insufficient alignment with national development priorities. The new institutional framework aims to rectify these limitations by fostering long-term planning capacity rather than reactive decision-making, regulatory coherence across agencies, certainty for private and public investment, stronger energy security mechanism, and an alignment between industrial policy and energy policy. In theory, this redesign could create the conditions for Mexico to integrate natural gas infrastructure, electricity generation, industrial expansion, and environmental objectives into a unified strategic plan, something the country has lacked for decades. But as with all structural reforms, the true impact depends on execution.

If implemented effectively, this institutional redesign could anchor the next 20 years of Mexico’s energy strategy and support the consolidation of Mexico as a North American energy leader. If implemented poorly, if captured by political fragmentation, administrative delays, or inconsistent interpretation, these reforms could entrench uncertainty, slow infrastructure deployment, and exacerbate Mexico’s existing vulnerabilities. The difference between success and failure will depend on leadership, coordination, and the capacity of institutions to rise above short-term pressures to deliver long-term national outcomes.

For instance, Mexico’s reliance on the United States for natural gas imports is one of the most defining characteristics of its energy landscape. This dependency is both a powerful competitive advantage and a source of acute vulnerability. US shale production is among the most prolific and cost-efficient in the world. The abundant supply exported through pipeline networks into Mexico has enabled low industrial energy costs, competitive electricity generation prices, expansion of manufacturing capacity, replacement of heavy fuels with cleaner natural gas, integration of Mexico into North America’s industrial and energy value chains, and a solid foundation for the nearshoring boom. This dynamic allowed Mexico to maintain one of the most competitive industrial energy cost structures in the world, attracting multinational manufacturers and enabling sectors such as automotive, steel, aerospace and electronics to flourish.

Yet, dependency is a fragile position when the supply originates beyond national borders. The lessons of February 2021’s Winter Storm remain a stark reminder of what can happen when weather, logistics, and political priorities collide. With natural gas imports concentrated primarily through the Waha hub in Texas, Mexico faces several ongoing risks:

Climate-driven supply disruptions Extreme cold snaps can interrupt or reduce cross-border flows.

Pipeline congestion: Growing US LNG exports increase competition for pipeline capacity.

Regulatory exposure: Changes in US environmental or export regulations directly affect Mexico.

Geopolitical volatility: Cross-border disputes or shifts in trade frameworks can influence flows.

Lack of diversification: Reliance on a single basin and single country is inherently risky.

Mexico has made notable progress in expanding natural gas infrastructure, particularly in the northern region. Yet, the country’s pipeline network remains uneven, storage capacity remains minimal, and connectivity gaps threaten to undermine industrial and regional development. The past decade has seen the development of cross-border and domestic pipelines that have substantially increased Mexico’s import capacity and regional interconnectivity. Projects being developed and under development have improved the country’s ability to receive volume and serve regional demand. However, the central and southern regions still lack adequate redundancy and infrastructure. Nearshoring-heavy states such as Queretaro, Guanajuato, and Puebla need expanded capacity to accommodate expected industrial growth.

Infrastructure Potential

So far, Mexico’s lack of natural gas storage is arguably the most dangerous gap in its energy security. Most countries maintain storage equivalent to 40–90 days of demand. Mexico has less than three days. It is no exaggeration to say that Mexico’s future energy security depends on building meaningful storage capacity. As well, many industrial corridors lack the last-mile pipeline connections needed to deliver gas from trunk pipelines to factories. Without last-mile solutions, even regions located near major pipelines cannot fully benefit from existing infrastructure. This gap becomes existential when multinational manufacturers evaluate whether a region can support multi-decade operations.

On the other hand, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is reshaping global gas markets, and Mexico is uniquely positioned to benefit from this transformation. Mexico’s west coast is emerging as one of the most geopolitically valuable corridors in the global LNG landscape. Pacific coast terminals have the potential to provide US-origin gas a faster route to Asian markets, bypass the Panama Canal, establish Mexico as a transpacific energy bridge, attract significant foreign investment, and develop world-class industrial ports and logistics centers. No other country holds this combination of infrastructure potential and geographic advantage.

It is important to start looking at small- and midscale LNG solutions that are becoming essential for remote mining operations, Industrial hubs without pipeline access, food processing, automotive and cement plants, power generation in isolated grids, and heavy-transport-sector fuel-switching. This model democratizes energy access across Mexico, reducing regional inequality and enabling industrial development in previously excluded regions. Incorporating LNG into Mexico’s energy system provides redundancy during pipeline outages, extreme weather, maintenance and peak demand periods.

Monumental Opportunity

The relocation of global supply chains represents the most monumental industrial opportunity for Mexico since the signing of NAFTA. Mexico is now becoming a manufacturing hub for North America, a logistics and supply chain center, a key location for advanced manufacturing, and a nearshore partner for high-value industries. States such as Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Queretaro, Puebla, Aguascalientes, and Guanajuato are experiencing levels of industrial development that strain existing energy infrastructure. Without expanded natural gas capacity, the nearshoring wave could slow, bypass or even relocate to US regions that will offer guaranteed energy availability, redundancy and storage, more predictable regulatory environments, and fully integrated energy infrastructure. That is why Mexico must align its energy planning with its industrial ambitions.

The global energy transition is accelerating, but it cannot progress without natural gas as a stabilizing force. Natural gas will remain essential through 2035 due to diverse factors, including its role in backing up intermittent renewables, lower emissions intensity, operational flexibility, contribution to cost-effective electricity generation, importance in industrial heat processes, compatibility with hydrogen blending, and its technological maturity. Mexico has significant renewable potential, but renewables cannot replace natural gas in the short to medium term without destabilizing the grid or undermining industrial competitiveness. We are at a relevant moment, and I envision these possible scenarios: (1) Mexico accomplishes effective regulatory implementation, expands infrastructure, builds storage, accelerates LNG deployment, and aligns energy strategy with industrial growth. (2) Progress occurs but is slow and uneven. Natural gas continues to fuel competitiveness, but systemic risks remain, and (3) the most pessimistic: regulatory delays, insufficient storage, and infrastructure bottlenecks constrain industrial growth (Mexico loses part of the nearshoring window). The difference between the first and second scenarios is execution, the difference between the second and third is urgency.

In conclusion, Mexico cannot afford passive strategies. It cannot wait another six years to start implementing its national strategies, it cannot afford slow implementation and to underestimate its vulnerabilities.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2023-01/Gasoducto-de-Morelos-Gamaliel-Corral-2-MBN.jpg?h=07e30506&itok=Mvyxg1x-,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:04.003463

Solar for All was created in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act so that low-income, rural, and disadvantaged communities could access clean, affordable, and reliable solar energy.
We need policies that bring reliable, affordable energy to Michiganders without leaving anyone behind.
When programs like Solar for All are disrupted midstream, the real costs fall on families, workers, and small businesses.
We need stable policies that keep energy affordable, create local jobs, and ensure that every Michigan community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more reliable future.","Thousands of Michigan families were preparing to save on their energy bills this year through local Solar for All projects, including affordable housing complexes in Oakland County to rural communities in the Upper Peninsula. Those plans are now on hold after federal officials announced they would cancel the program, even though the funds were already distributed and projects were underway.

The Michigan Attorney General is right to challenge this reversal. At stake isn’t just funding, it’s fairness. The sudden halt means uncertainty for families expecting lower bills and for small businesses counting on steady work. Michigan had received $156 million to bring affordable, reliable energy to 18,000 households across the state and drive investment in the state’s clean energy workforce—all now in limbo.

With so many clean energy tax credits repealed under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” it’s vital to protect programs like Solar for All, which ensure the benefits of the clean energy transition reach people of all income levels.

While solar adopters have grown more diverse, they still tend to be more affluent because rooftop solar is largely limited to individuals who own their own homes. Solar for All was created in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act so that low-income, rural, and disadvantaged communities could access clean, affordable, and reliable solar energy.

In Michigan, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) has already awarded $13.9 million in grants to fund pilot programs for projects like installing solar on homes serving low-income and formerly homeless seniors in Oakland County and building rooftop solar for households with residents who rely on electric medical devices in the Upper Peninsula. All of the projects were designed to deliver at least a 20% reduction in household electricity costs for the participants while supporting local job growth by connecting solar installers and maintenance workers to new opportunities. EGLE Director Philip Roos estimated that the program would have created 700 high-quality jobs across the state.

None of this, unfortunately, is all that surprising. Sudden funding reversals have become a recurring pattern under the second Trump administration, often followed by court challenges and reinstatements. In fact, Solar for All contracts were frozen briefly before a federal judge ordered a reinstatement in April. The same happened with the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was eventually restored after a judge rejected the Department of Transportation’s efforts to cancel the program. In its press release unfreezing NEVI grants, the DOT acknowledged that it couldn’t withhold funding that was already approved by Congress. “We will respect Congress’ will,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Solar for All seems to be following the same trajectory. It, too, was a congressionally approved program with federal funding already appropriated. But unlike previous attempts that stopped funds from going out, the Trump administration is trying to rescind money it has already disbursed. Even if Nessel’s office can get Solar for All funds reinstated, damage from the chaos, uncertainty, and paused work will have already been done.

As electricity bills continue to rise, no one disputes that we need more energy generation to keep up with demand and maintain affordability. But the way we achieve that goal matters. Halting programs that make energy cleaner and more affordable for working families is the wrong approach. Likewise, pulling the rug out from under workers and small businesses that rely on these programs will only lead to volatility in our local economies and undermine job security. We need policies that bring reliable, affordable energy to Michiganders without leaving anyone behind. And that means supporting programs like Solar for All.

Michigan has a rich history of innovation. That includes everything from manufacturing to mobility to energy. But innovation requires consistency. When programs like Solar for All are disrupted midstream, the real costs fall on families, workers, and small businesses. We need stable policies that keep energy affordable, create local jobs, and ensure that every Michigan community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more reliable future.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/825e59_d7a79c5d435c4049a2bbb3c48a439cbbmv2_d_4000_3000_s_4_2-2048x1366-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:00.925957
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-12-04 12:15:29+00:00,News From The States,Utility asks New Mexico for 'zero emission' status for gas-fired power plant,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/utility-asks-new-mexico-zero-emission-status-gas-fired-power-plant,"“It’s profound greenwashing.” Southwestern Public Service Company has requested that all costs associated with two new solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers.
These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25.
Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas.
But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers.","The Southwestern Public Service Company has asked the state of New Mexico to grant exceptions to the state’s Energy Transition Act for two proposed gas-fired power plants, including one exception that would see approximately one-third of the energy produced at one plant qualify as a “zero-carbon resource” like solar panels or wind turbines.

A second exception would exempt both plants from the act’s zero-carbon requirement, “to preserve system reliability and protect customers from unreasonable bill impacts.”

The two proposed plants would be in Texas, with the larger of the two — called Gaines County Power Plant — to be built just across the border from Hobbs, New Mexico. Even though the two wouldn’t be in the state, New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires that all energy sold in the state by investor-owned utilities be from zero-carbon-emission sources by 2045, no matter where it is generated. The act was an early environmental win for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The request is part of a wide-ranging application the Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, has before the Public Regulation Commission of New Mexico for new transmission lines, extended closure dates for existing coal-fired power plants and eight new power facilities — two each of natural gas, solar, wind and battery systems. The $10 billion plan covers the company’s service area in the southeast corner of the state and parts of West Texas.

While most of the proposed plants would generate renewable energy, the two gas plants would generate 51% of the total energy in the application.

“To pretend that natural gas in some way or another is a zero carbon resource is just a bald-faced lie,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, and an energy watchdog. “It’s profound greenwashing.”

Southwestern Public Service Company has requested that all costs associated with two new solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers.

The majority of Southwestern Public Service Company’s coverage area and energy sales are in Texas, but, according to Xcel, much of the projected increase in energy would be used in New Mexico, particularly in the state’s portion of the Permian Basin, the nation’s largest oil field. More than 50% of the company’s energy sales in New Mexico already go to oil and gas companies to power their wells and other infrastructure with grid-based electricity. Oil and gas revenues are also the state’s biggest single source of income.

According to the application, replacing the two proposed gas plants with renewable energy sources would cost New Mexico customers an additional $5.5 billion and raise residential electricity rates by more than 40%.

And the gas plants may be on the way. “We have already signed and executed contracts for the turbines,” Kaley Green, a senior media relations representative for Xcel Energy, said. “We anticipate a 40-year service life for each of the plants.”

In the application the company requests that all costs associated with the two solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers because they will be built to meet New Mexico Energy Transition Act requirements, “not because they were needed for the overall system.” In addition, it asks for a speedy approval of the solar plants to secure renewable energy tax credits that were enhanced under President Joe Biden but had their timeframes dramatically curtailed under President Donald Trump.

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25. The commission plans to reach a decision on the Gaines Plant zero-carbon request by Dec. 10 and a decision on the full application by May 7. Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.

“It is a lot for one filing, but it’s not absurd,” said AnnaLinden Weller, senior policy adviser with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit that fights climate change and its impacts across the western U.S. Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “It’s certainly the biggest one that I’ve seen, but not by a huge amount.”

Southwestern Public Service Company cites several factors for the size and complexity of the application: It wants to close two aging coal-fired plants in Texas; it sees increased demand from oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin, data centers and other industries; and there are new requirements from the power-sharing system in which the new plants would operate, the Southwest Power Pool. Despite its name, the pool runs from southeast New Mexico north to the Canadian border, balancing production loads from utility companies in 14 states along the way.

In August 2024, the pool raised the production reserve requirements of member utilities like Xcel from an annual 15% to 16% in summer and 36% in winter. (A production reserve requirement is extra power production capacity available for unexpected peak loads.) The new winter load requirement was in part a response to the winter storms of 2021 and 2022 that created sudden, massive electrical demands from damaged energy systems across the Southwest Power Pool.

The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

The request to keep the new gas-fired plants beyond 2045, when New Mexico pledged to reach zero carbon emissions, aims for a possible loophole in the law.

“So there’s a weird thing about the Renewable Energy Act. It doesn’t prohibit fossil fuels per se,” Weller said, so long as the utility can convince the Public Regulation Commission that it will be producing zero carbon electricity for New Mexico customers by 2045 while hitting ever smaller targets along the way.

Xcel’s Green said, “We will continue to work towards compliance with the 2045 goals and adjust our grid planning as we proceed, based on technology and other factors.”

If that’s not possible, Weller said the commission has the discretion to give utilities “wiggle room” for the 2045 zero carbon requirement if the utility faces reliability or affordability issues — both of which Southwestern Public Service Company explicitly claimed in its application. No utility has tried for such an exemption before, Weller said.

In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas. That plant would have produced about 11% of the electricity that the proposed Gaines County and Tolk plants would generate together. But, “They didn’t have a plan for how it would be possible for them to comply with the Renewable Energy Act,” Weller said — such as asking for exemptions from the act.

Another loophole in the act allows a utility to claim a fossil fuel plant is a “zero carbon resource” if that plant’s use reduces methane emissions “as a result of electricity production” by a 10-to-1 ratio or better of carbon dioxide to methane emissions. Southwestern Public Service Company hired an outside economist to show how electrifying oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin could offset enough methane emitted by wells and associated facilities to qualify roughly one-third of the electricity from the Gaines County plant as “zero carbon.”

“We’re still thinking about that as a legal question,” Weller said. “A plain reading of the Renewable Energy Act [the underlying law for the Energy Transition Act] says that the generation resource has to be zero carbon, not the effects of the generation resource.”

She added, “Are there climate impacts? Yeah. The question is are they big enough or worthwhile enough given what you’re building.”

Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate warming, but methane is far more potent, producing more than 80 times the warming potential as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

On Nov. 12, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 World Energy Outlook, which concluded that oil and gas demand will not peak before 2050, as previously hoped for — and needed — if the planet is to avoid increasingly frequent climate change catastrophes. The report goes on to say that with the increase in fossil fuel use, “exceeding 1.5°C is now inevitable.” Holding global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels was the stated goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.

“There is some low-hanging fruit that we can get from electrifying the oil field, and ideally the infrastructure would be communicable to some future replacement industries that might help the state head in some different direction,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director.

“But you can’t deny the fact that it basically builds a more permanent infrastructure around oil and gas extraction,” she continued. “There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

In 2023, Chevron touted a 20-megawatt solar field it built in southern New Mexico to power a nearby gas facility and reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. For a while, the facility was a prominent focus of the company’s social media advertising in New Mexico.

But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers. The plant is expected to produce 2.5 gigawatts of electricity, 125 times the amount of the solar field.

When asked about the fossil fuel power plants in the Southwestern Public Service Company application and how they mesh with the Energy Transition Act her administration championed, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s office punted.

Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, wrote, “Nearly half of this proposal is renewable energy. The same law that sets those aggressive renewables targets provides an exception process for utilities to protect system reliability. We’re confident the [Public Regulation Commission] can make the technical determination about whether it’s truly necessary. We’ll let that process move forward.”

If approved, Southwestern Public Service Company will build the Gaines County plant about five miles south-southeast of Hobbs, a town of about 40,000. The prevailing wind patterns would carry much of the exhaust from the new plant right over town.

“It’s not like there’s some bright-line border separating New Mexico and Texas’ pollution,” Feibelman said, and the region already suffers from bad air pollution. The American Lung Association has given both Lea and Eddy counties — the center of New Mexico’s portion of the Permian — failing grades for their ozone levels. The American Lung Association does not have ozone figures for the Texas side of the basin.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/permian_2025-01-scaled-11764782769.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=qAbozNar,N,,2025-12-04 12:01:51.863961

Kiley has trotted out the familiar anti-gerrymandering slogan, “voters should choose their representatives, representatives shouldn’t choose their voters.” More generally, he has called out the partisan opportunism that has spread throughout our system and created a sense of political disempowerment.","There is something surreal about the conflict currently playing out in Indiana, where the president of the United States has turned his tweet-borne fury on a group of Republican state senators. Their offense? Not wanting to change the state’s congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.

In 2024, about 40 percent of Hoosiers voted for a Democrat for both U.S. senator and governor. Given that partisan split, the current U.S. House delegation of seven Republicans and two Democrats might seem more than satisfactory for Republicans. And given that mid-decade redistricting is unusual (not to say unheard of), one might think that continuing to use the map drawn in 2021, after the last census, is entirely unremarkable.

And yet, in our strange moment of gerrymander-mania, the 20 or so Republican state legislators willing to stand up for standing pat are indeed quite extraordinary. Their willingness to resist Donald Trump, who bestrides their party like a colossus, requires not only gumption but also courage; having earned the president’s ire, at least 11 of these state legislators have been the targets of “swatting” or bomb threats. Less menacingly, they are also likely to draw primary challenges.

That one of the leading senators is named “Goode” makes it tempting to see the conflict in Manichaean terms. One may wish to salute these lawmakers for their fortitude—the Washington Post’s editorial page, for example, offered its devoutly centrist “kudos” to them.

But what are they actually standing up for? What are our gerrymandering wars all about?

The president and his Republican antagonists have two very different visions of representation in our political system.

Trump’s position flows straightforwardly from his view of politics as a sorting of people into two camps: those who are with him in taking on the corrupt establishment, and those who are against him. Trump is no political theorist, of course, but he has a consistent plebiscitary instinct in making sense of political conflict. The big question for voters, of course, is who they want to be president; once they have chosen, every ensuing decision is a kind of echo referendum on whether they will affirm their commitment or renege. Trump was quick to condemn Indiana’s “RINO senators” in his way; a decade ago, “Republicans In Name Only” was applied to ideological squishes, but in Trump’s time, it is simply a term of abuse for those Republicans who (on any given day) are unprepared to reaffirm their support for the president.

Trump’s partisan allies may wish to represent aspects of their constituencies that do not figure in this grand struggle, and even today’s with-me-or-against-me politics leave room for action on lesser issues, where the president is not actively engaging. Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa could push through a bill improving IRS-taxpayer communications without the president even bothering to comment; even Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona could move a bill requiring a study of cancer prevalence in the armed services.

But when ideas of local or interest-based representation leave legislators crosswise with the president, the conflict must be worked out quickly. Trump is not always imperious; sometimes he reverts to his deal-making, conciliatory sensibility. On the question of his tariff policies’ effects on U.S. farmers, Trump’s strategy is to use side payments to minimize objections, though it is unclear whether that will be enough to satisfy angry cattle ranchers this time around.

On pure questions of political advantage, though, it is difficult to find any middle ground. Are you for him, or against? If for, the thinking goes, then why not do everything possible (at least what is defensibly within the rules) to maximize our side’s scope for action? If our side is not willing to use its power to implement our mandate, what are we here for?

Such logic has convinced Republican legislators in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina to redraw their congressional districts this year with an eye to maximizing their advantage; Florida may well follow. Democrats in California framed their own redistricting, put to voters in a ballot initiative, as an explicit response to Republicans’ seat grabs; if they’ll do it, then surely we should too.

Framed in these terms, the makeup of the House of Representatives really is important, but only in one sense: whether the president’s party has enough seats to help him “fulfill his mandate” or, instead, whether the opposition party has enough seats to “stop his abuses.” Midterm elections, which tend to favor the party not holding the White House, can be regarded as a benign means of registering Americans’ thermostatic preferences. But, from the president’s point of view, they can alternatively be seen as a way for bad actors to nullify the “real” decision rendered by the American people in the presidential election.

If this seems like a rather thin idea of representation, flattening out nearly all the differences between citizens from different parts of the country, its very simplicity makes it quite potent, especially when the president pursues it with the many carrots and sticks at his disposal. Gov. Mike Braun’s summation of the situation gets right to the point: “If [the Senate is] dragging its feet, and keeping Indiana from doing things that we could, especially with the relationship we have with the administration, who knows what happens with that good relationship. We can’t have a Senate that’s constantly a wet blanket.” In this view (which Braun hardly rushed to embrace), the legislator’s first and foremost duty is to stay onside with the party’s top leader.

What is the contrasting vision driving the opponents of redistricting?

First, many of the objectors are making straightforward tactical and prudential arguments that do not rise to the level of philosophical disagreements. They believe attempts to redistrict will face legal resistance that will render them useless or even counterproductive. (Notably, the Maryland Senate’s top Democrat has opposed redistricting efforts in the Old Line State for this reason, and has been harshly criticized by Democrats for not being more willing to pursue complete dominance in the blue state.) Texas Republicans’ current legal difficulties (now before the U.S. Supreme Court) suggest the merits of such concerns, however they are ultimately resolved. An aggressive Indiana redistricting would probably face a civil rights challenge (which the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus has indicated it would bring).

A more fundamental objection to redistricting, cited by many of the GOP objectors, is simply that Hoosiers do not support redrawing their lines. When the aforementioned state senator, Greg Goode, held a listening session with his constituents, not one stood up to argue for the propriety of the mid-decade redistricting, and only six of 200 who attended noted their support on a sign-in sheet. More generally, opinion polling shows that most Hoosiers are skeptical of the move. Legislators apparently feel obliged to represent the stated opinions of their constituents fairly, even when that conflicts with directives from their party’s leadership. The Indiana Senate’s president pro tempore, Rodric Bray, argues that if they are seen by their constituents as constantly manipulating the rules of the game, they will lack the trust needed to make difficult decisions stick.

Indiana Republicans also profess faith in their ability to add a GOP seat through old-fashioned contestation, without changing any boundaries. Indiana’s 1st Congressional District, centered on the city of Gary in the northwest corner of the state, has sent a Democrat to the House every cycle since 1930, but it is a genuinely competitive district today; Kamala Harris carried it with just 49.4 percent of the vote, and incumbent Rep. Frank J. Mrvan won just 53.4 percent. Republicans say they think a strong effort there could plausibly flip the district in their very red state.

Implicit in this argument is a normative defense of the continuity of representation, and it ought to be made explicit. There is a positive good being served by Indiana’s congressional districts remaining more or less steady, which gives voters a genuine sense of political self-determination. The 1st District has covered the state’s northwest corner for many decades, allowing its residents a sense that their region has a real voice in Washington. The current Mrvan’s father, Frank E. Mrvan Jr., was a state senator for decades. If the residents of Gary see fit to change direction, as they might well do, it should be on account of their own choice, not because the national GOP found a way to tactically outmaneuver Democrats.

On the national stage, the person who has best articulated this position is Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican who is likely to lose his seat after his state’s redistricting and has offered a bill to prohibit mid-decade redistricting. Kiley has trotted out the familiar anti-gerrymandering slogan, “voters should choose their representatives, representatives shouldn’t choose their voters.” More generally, he has called out the partisan opportunism that has spread throughout our system and created a sense of political disempowerment. A situation of “rolling redistricting, where the ground beneath our feet is constantly shifting—and, by the way, creating a huge distraction for the entire country at a time when we have so many more important things to worry about,” ultimately leaves our republic weaker, Kiley convincingly argues.

The vision of representation shared by Kiley and the Indiana objectors is one in which voters and their representatives have a meaningful relationship that goes well beyond partisan affiliation. That vision holds to our founding ideal of self-government in a way that the plebiscitary vision does not, and it still holds real appeal for the American people, even as the us-and-them dynamic dominates media coverage of our political moment and holds sway with our most influential partisan leaders. It will be fascinating to see whether the ideal of local representation can hold its ground—and Indiana’s district boundaries—in the months ahead.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png?x85095&v=69BgboyWbL,N,,2025-12-04 09:58:52.448665

Strong demand for French electric vehicles In a declining French automobile market, EVs are holding up well.

Only the Tesla Model Y is an exception, being the only “premium” car in electric cars top sales.
Maintaining the deadlines while supporting the European electric vehicle sector will help the automobile sector overcome the risks associated with this transition.","With the aim to reduce its CO2 emissions and costly fossil-fuel imports, in 2022 the European Parliament adopted a rule that, from 2035, all new vehicles must be zero-emission, which essentially means that they must be electric. However, this rule is now being questioned, with car manufacturers requesting that it be revised to allow plug-in hybrids or vehicles that run on biofuels, among other changes. Ultimately, if these changes are permitted, this would amount to the continuation of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles being sold after 2035.

To justify their requests, the manufacturers are highlighting the crisis that the automobile sector is facing, with declining sales and some factories shutting down. Added to this are the risks of new competition from China, particularly strong in the electric vehicle (EV) segment, as highlighted in a recent parliamentary report (Senat, 2025).

Yet, on closer inspection, the sector’s crisis is less due to the rise of EVs than to manufacturers’ ill-suited strategy of focusing on larger and more expensive ICE vehicles. In a shrinking automobile market, EVs are holding up better than ICE vehicles, especially small French models. Finally, France is well-positioned to produce more EVs, justifying the significant investments made in the sector, from batteries to EV charging infrastructure.

A crisis inherited from the “premium” strategy

Over 25 years, French vehicle production (specifically passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy trucks, buses and coaches) has dropped from 3.3 million to 1.4 million vehicles, leading to factory closures and many job losses (DGE, 2024). This long-standing crisis, which began well before the rise of EVs, is explained by an automobile market that has increasingly focused on “premium” vehicles—more powerful, heavier, larger, and, above all, more expensive. This is a domain where German brands excel, while French brands, specialising in small vehicles, have failed to establish themselves: between 2001 and 2023, Renault, Citroën and Peugeot lost market share, dropping from 25% to 15% of the EU market (Pardi, 2025). Furthermore, to remain competitive in the low-cost small vehicles market, French automobile groups have offshored a large part of their production: in 2023, French car manufacturers produced 23% of their light vehicles in France compared to 53% in 2005 (Banque de France, 2025).

This strategy accelerated after the Covid crisis. Between 2020 and 2024, vehicle prices in France increased by 24% and sales fell by 22%. According to a detailed analysis of prices by segment, researchers from the Institute Mobility in Transition found that half of the price increase is due to manufacturers’ market power, through upselling and pricing power (IMT, 2025). Beyond excluding much of the middle class from the new-car market, this strategy leads to a 22% drop in sales. This trend has intensified in 2025: based on data available to date, the market is expected to reach 1.71 million registrations by year-end, compared to 1.76 million in 2024 and 1.82 million in 2023.

Strong demand for French electric vehicles

In a declining French automobile market, EVs are holding up well. In 2025, sales of electric cars have already surpassed those of 2024 for the same period. According to data available at the end of September, and factoring in France’s most recent round of its social leasing programme (launched on 30th September),1 electric cars should reach about 20% of the market for new cars in France for the whole of 2025 (see the chart below).

Source: SDES, “New light vehicle engines – CO2 emissions and ecological bonus” – September 2025.

Despite the market downturn, electric cars are holding up well because they are becoming increasingly affordable. Their operating cost is much lower than that of ICE vehicles, but their purchase price has long been the main barrier. Nowadays, however, more affordable models are becoming available, such as the Renault 5 e-Tech or the Citroën ë-C3 launched at the end of 2024, both under €25,000. In addition, subsidies, previously in the form of an ecological bonus and now via an energy savings certificate (a “Certificat d’Economie d’Energie”, CEE) premium, help reduce the extra purchase cost compared to an ICE car.

Above all, affordable small models are successful in France. The latest round of the social leasing programme, with EVs available at between €100 and €200 per month, is in high demand among low-income households. In the rest of the market, small electric cars are also popular: the Renault 5, ë-C3 and Peugeot e-208—three city cars at moderate prices—are three of the four best-selling models. Only the Tesla Model Y is an exception, being the only “premium” car in electric cars top sales.

Measures to support the European automobile industry

Currently, about 75% of the value chain of an EV sold in Europe is also located in Europe. While this is a high share, it is lower than that of an ICE vehicle produced in Europe, at 90%. This difference is mainly due to the battery, which is often made in China, with key components also produced there. As things stand, the transition to EVs would expose car manufacturers in Europe to supply risks. This is why support for the restructuring of the sector is being provided at both the French and the EU level, with subsidies from the French government for the creation of battery gigafactories, or the implementation of the “RESourceEU” plan2 to develop the entire supply chain in Europe, including sourcing rare earths.

Competition from Chinese EVs, often cheaper than European ones, is also presented as an obstacle to the automobile sector becoming 100% electric. However, to limit the impact of this competition, which is considered not to be on a level playing field, measures have been put in place, such as taxes on imports of EVs made in China. The application of these taxes has not only limited imports of Chinese vehicles but also encouraged manufacturers to produce in Europe. Financial incentives for buying or leasing EVs also help, with the environmental score in the French eco-bonus3 or the European Commission super-bonus for vehicles whose battery is made in Europe. Thus, in 2024, imports of EVs fell by a quarter, reducing France’s trade deficit in this market segment (Les Échos, 14th August 2025).

Reversing the 2035 zero-emissions target puts investments and activities at risk

With state support, automobile manufacturers and energy providers have joined forces to organise the production of EVs in France, especially battery manufacturing, by creating gigafactories. Building these large-scale plants required significant investment, some of which was state-subsidised. Developing production capacity provides security of supply for the automobile sector and better cost control, but to succeed against cheaper Chinese batteries, these plants need outlets in the national and European markets.

Downstream, in order to overcome what has often been a barrier to EV adoption, vehicle charging infrastructure providers have made significant investments and increased the number of available charging stations. They now need to see their infrastructure being used in order to make their investments profitable.

The transition to EVs is accelerating, due to their advantages in combating climate change and reducing air pollution, their lower operating cost, and their contribution to energy security. Revising the targets would delay the sector’s transformation and put at risk the investments made in the EV production chain in France. Moreover, revising the rule, and including plug-in hybrids or biofuels vehicles, would not provide any immediate outlet for currently unsold ICE vehicles. Maintaining the deadlines while supporting the European electric vehicle sector will help the automobile sector overcome the risks associated with this transition.",https://www.i4ce.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Maia_a-la-une.png,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:42.243466

As written under the current version of the bill, ratepayers would pay those subsidies in perpetuity.
Nuclear plant cost overruns aren’t unheard of, and they can be significant.
Two nuclear units completed in Georgia in 2023 saw their cost balloon from a projected $14 billion to a realized $31 billion.
Some detractors warned against imposing additional costs on ratepayers before the state studies what types of energy generation best fit its needs.","An unusual coalition that includes business groups, environmental activists, and New Jersey’s ratepayer advocate is urging lawmakers to reject a legislative proposal that would see residents pay for the construction of a new nuclear power plant years before it begins sending energy to the grid.

The bill, introduced last month during the final weeks of the Legislature’s current session, would add a mandatory charge on every ratepayer’s electricity bill to cover 5% of the projected construction costs of a to-be-constructed nuclear plant generating at least 1,100 megawatts of electricity.

The measure’s opponents warn that the bill, sponsored by Sens. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) and John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), would shift risk from the plant’s developers to residents who could ill-afford further rate increases after a steep hike this summer that will be followed by another price spike next June.

“There are going to be people after this bill who aren’t going to be able to afford their electric bill,” Brian Lipman, director of the state’s rate counsel division, which advocates for utility customers before the state’s energy regulators, told the Senate’s energy committee Monday.

The advanced nuclear development charge would add between $22 and $55 to residential ratepayers’ monthly bills, Lipman said, and consumers would likely pay that charge for at least a decade before a nuclear plant actually comes online. Lipman called that framework unprecedented.

The plan would lead some to pay as much as $6,600 over the next decade for a plant that will not have produced any electricity.

As written under the current version of the bill, ratepayers would pay those subsidies in perpetuity.

“I don’t think any of us intend that this credit is something that’s going to be paid by our grandchildren for, say, the 80-year expected life of the facility,” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University.

The committee advanced the bill in a 4-1 vote. Sen. Parker Space (R-Sussex) voted no.

Though New Jersey’s ratepayers fund utilities’ infrastructure investments through their utility bills, utilities are only permitted to recoup the cost of their investments after projects go into service.

Industrial and commercial customers who use large amounts of power and almost exclusively procure their electricity from off-grid third-party suppliers would face far steeper costs, said Steven Goldenberg, counsel for the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition.

“When Brian says that the average residential ratepayer will see the rates increase $55 a month, that is huge,” Goldenberg said. “But when it gets translated to my people, we’re talking five figures every month.”

Board of Public Utilities President Christine Guhl-Sadovy, the only person to speak in favor of the bill during Monday’s committee hearing, argued that private firms need subsidies to secure U.S. Department of Energy loans that could cover as much as 80% of a nuclear project’s costs.

Energy markets could not support private investment in new nuclear plants despite recent and looming price rises, she said, at least not without ratepayer support.

“Even conservative estimates for load growth make a strong case for building new nuclear generation. We have a responsibility at the BPU to ensure reliable and affordable utility service. If the state does not invest in new generation, electricity will continue on the path of being unaffordable,” she said.

Opponents said the risk to ratepayers is too great.

Provisions in the bill would allow developers to seek and obtain, as-of-right, ratepayer dollars to help pay for cost overruns not exceeding 20% of a project’s forecasted costs, and developers are permitted to seek ratepayer funds for larger increases with approval from the Board of Public Utilities.

The state would be hard-pressed to deny requests for larger cost overruns, especially those that come years into a project’s development, Silverman said. Those requests would put regulators in a difficult position: Pay more, or kill a project for which ratepayers have already supported with hundreds of millions — or even billions — of dollars.

Nuclear plant cost overruns aren’t unheard of, and they can be significant. Two nuclear units completed in Georgia in 2023 saw their cost balloon from a projected $14 billion to a realized $31 billion. Some estimates peg the cost as high as $37 billion. The units went online more than six years behind schedule.

The Georgia plants’ construction was the first the country saw in decades. Guhl-Sadovy argued the lessons learned there would prevent similar overruns in New Jersey.

“A lot of mistakes, I think, were made and recognized, and changes have been made,” she said. “We would not anticipate those kinds of cost overruns.”

The bill would not require developers of a project completed on time to fully return the ratepayers’ investment. Though the bill mandates developers return at least some revenue to ratepayers, it would allow the Board of Public Utilities to negotiate how much.

Some detractors warned against imposing additional costs on ratepayers before the state studies what types of energy generation best fit its needs.

Others warned New Jersey wouldn’t see the full benefits of cost reduction from subsidized new generation because that power would be sold on PJM Interconnection’s 13-state grid, spreading its benefit to states outside of New Jersey.

There’s no guarantee that subsidized nuclear plants could even participate in PJM. The U.S. Supreme Court found a 2011 New Jersey program that sought to underwrite the construction of new gas plants by guaranteeing they earn a set amount in energy markets unconstitutionally infringed on federal regulatory authority.

“This bill does almost the same thing,” Lipman said in written testimony provided to the committee.

Others cautioned the bill should not move before Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office.

Energy policy was a major focus of her campaign, and adding $55 in fixed monthly costs could doom her pledge to freeze energy rates once she’s inaugurated on Jan. 20.

“I don’t think that we should be working, moving forward on comprehensive reform or any kind of major investment in new generation in front of Mikie Sherrill taking her seat,” said Dena Mottola Jaborska, associated director of New Jersey Citizen Action. “She did make this a signature issue in her campaign, and I do feel like six weeks is not enough time.”

It’s not clear whether the bill will reach Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk before he leaves office, or if he would sign it if it does.

The bill had no Assembly companion as of Wednesday, and the Senate version did not appear on the agenda for the Senate Budget Committee’s Monday meeting.

Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime sponsor, appeared to suggest the measure could see changes.

“Is this a controversial bill? Yes. Do we have any solutions for the future of New Jersey? Not really. Has the discussion started? Yes, it has,” he said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-92/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/power-plant-scaled-1-1024x6861764849538.jpg?h=e7c891e8&itok=e3qo4Soc,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:17.803930

But high natural gas prices and growing demand for electricity are playing a bigger role in stoking demand for coal.
Last year, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per million British thermal units, while this year they are on track to average $3.50 per MMBtu.
American LNG shipments are expected to increase 25 percent this year, putting upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices.

Coal is enjoying a revival, natural gas generation is down, and renewables are forging ahead despite political headwinds. Some of that is driven by annual idiosyncrasies like weather, which increased electricity demand this year, and President Donald Trump’s dismantling of environmental regulations and the Inflation Reduction Act.

But most of the market’s upheaval is due to wider economic trends that burst into full view this year — namely, the growth in U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas and rising electricity demand from data centers.

“I feel like we’re at the edge of the storm,” said Ric O’Connell, the executive director of the consulting firm GridLab. “The storm is the load growth that is showing up in the next couple of years. The IRA is going away, and gas prices are potentially going to spike. The next couple of years could be messy.”

The trends mark a fundamental shift from the previous decade, which was defined by stagnant power demand, low natural gas prices, coal plant retirements and a wave of renewable installations.

Firing up coal

Coal generation was up 13 percent through the end of September compared with the same time last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Part of the increase is due to a cold winter and hot summer, said Andy Blumenfeld, an analyst who tracks coal markets at the consulting company McCloskey by OPIS.

But high natural gas prices and growing demand for electricity are playing a bigger role in stoking demand for coal. Last year, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per million British thermal units, while this year they are on track to average $3.50 per MMBtu. Next year, gas prices are expected to increase to an average $4 per MMBtu, according to EIA.

When utilities see gas prices like that, they tend to fire up coal.

Coal has enjoyed mini-revivals before, most recently in 2022. What makes this year different is that coal’s rebound is playing out at a time when the U.S. is shipping more gas abroad while demand for power grows at home.

American LNG shipments are expected to increase 25 percent this year, putting upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices.

“LNG is tying us more to global markets that pay more than we do for gas,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin. “That has to put more upward pressure on gas.”

Power-hungry AI

At the same time, technology companies and data center developers are hoovering up all the megawatts they can find.

Analysts predict the artificial intelligence boom will need 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, drastically driving up U.S. energy demand. Electricity demand nationwide was up 2 percent through the first nine months of the year, according to EIA data.

All that is a recipe for generating electricity from coal plants that once sat idle. In 2023 and 2024, coal plants ran at 42 percent of their capacity. This year, they are running at almost half capacity.

Growing electricity demand has been “good news” for coal plant operators, Blumenfeld said.

“Coal is low-hanging fruit,” he said, noting it is easy for utilities to fire up existing plants.

Even so, there are limits to how much coal can grow. In the fuel’s heyday, coal plants typically operated around 60 percent of their capacity, Blumenfeld said. That gives coal plants some more room to grow production. But hitting those numbers will be hard for coal plants given large seasonal jumps in renewable production, he said.

Indeed, wind and solar generated 646 terawatt-hours of electricity in the U.S. through September, eclipsing the 561 TWh produced by coal. Gas, meanwhile, was down 4 percent to almost 1,384 TWh.

The strong renewable numbers stem in large part from another strong year for solar installations. But GridLab’s O’Connell expects those numbers to fall starting in 2027 because of Trump’s moves to end clean energy tax credits and make it more difficult to build wind and solar projects.

O’Connell’s chief concern is that the U.S. will find itself in a position where it is more exposed to global fluctuations in gas prices at the same time power demand is rising and renewable installations slow.

“Those are going to be felt in five years when projects that should have come online don’t come online,” he said. “This is perfect storm. We took away support for clean energy when we needed it most and we needed to get it online quickly.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/17/6b/f3a429104614a4a6461595f012a9/election-2024-war-on-coal-42153.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 07:59:07.311870

Regulatory pressures from programs such as ReFuelEU and the International Maritime Organization are pushing carriers toward lower-carbon alternatives, but high costs remain a key barrier. Management believes the merger creates a pathway to reduce the effective cost of low-carbon fuels by pairing fuel production with environmental-asset generation.

A Louisiana-Anchored Platform Targeting Cost-Competitive, Carbon-Negative SAF

Southern’s planned Louisiana facility will be the first major project within the combined platform, using waste biomass and integrated carbon capture to produce green methanol and carbon-negative SAF with one of the lowest lifecycle carbon intensities on the market.

The company expects to leverage federal incentives in the near term but is designing the system to achieve long-term cost competitiveness independent of subsidies, supported by co-products generated throughout the process.

Executives emphasized Louisiana’s strategic advantages, including feedstock availability, logistics infrastructure, and an experienced industrial workforce. The State of Louisiana has been an early partner in the project, with both companies signaling continued collaboration as development progresses.

Storage market twists and turns Though the storage industry pioneers somehow nailed the 35-gigawatt goal, market growth defied their expectations in several important ways.
California, Texas, and Arizona alone hold roughly 80% of all U.S. battery storage capacity.
In 2017 the storage industry was intently focused on getting batteries installed, not so much on where they came from.
“By the end of next year, we anticipate reaching the milestone of producing as many domestic energy storage battery cells as we need for demand,” Roberts said.","In 2017, the early leaders in energy storage made an audacious bet: 35 gigawatts of the new grid technology would be installed in the United States by 2025.

That goal sounded improbable even to some who believed that storage was on a growth trajectory. A smattering of independent developers and utilities had managed to install just 500 megawatts of batteries nationwide, equivalent to one good-size gas-fired power plant. Building 35 gigawatts would entail a 70-fold growth in just eight years.

The number didn’t come out of thin air, though. The Energy Storage Association worked with Navigant Research to model scenarios based on a range of assumptions, recalled Praveen Kathpal, then chair of the ESA board of directors. The association decided to run with the most aggressive of the defensible scenarios in its November 2017 report.

In 2021, ESA agreed to merge with the American Clean Power Association and ceased to exist. But, somehow, its boast proved not self-aggrandizing but prophetic.

The U.S. crossed the threshold of 35 gigawatts of battery installations this July and then passed 40 gigawatts in the third quarter, according to data from the American Clean Power Association. The group of vendors, developers, and installers who just eight years ago stood at the margins of the power industry is now second only to solar developers in gigawatts built per year. Storage capacity outnumbers gas power in the queues for future grid additions by a factor of 6.5, according to data compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Storage has become the dominant form of new power addition,” Kathpal said. ​“I think it’s fair to say that batteries are how America does capacity.”

Getting from basically no grid batteries to 35 gigawatts

Back in 2017, I was covering the young storage industry for an outlet called Greentech Media, a beat that was complicated by how little was happening. There was much to write about the ​“enormous potential” of energy storage to make the grid more reliable and affordable, but it required caveats like ​“if states change their grid regulations to allow this new technology to compete fairly on its merits, yada yada yada.”

Those batteries that did get built in 2017 look tiny by today’s standards. The locally owned utility cooperative in Kauai built a trailblazing 13-megawatt/52-megawatt-hour battery, the first such utility-scale system designed to sit alongside a solar power plant. And 2017 saw the tail end of the Aliso Canyon procurement, a foundational trial for the storage industry in which developers built a series of batteries in Southern California in just a handful of months to shore up the grid after a record-busting gas leak — adding up to about 100 megawatts.

“You saw green shoots of a lot of where the industry has gone,” said Kathpal.

California passed a law creating a storage mandate in 2010, then found a pressing need for the technology to neutralize the threat of summertime power shortages. Kauai’s small island grid quickly hit a saturation point with daytime solar, so the utility wanted a battery to shift that clean power into the nighttime. These installations weren’t research projects; they were solving real grid problems. But they were few and far in between.

Kathpal recalled one moment that encapsulated the storage industry’s early lean era. At the time, he was developing storage projects for the independent power producer AES. One night around midnight, he parked a rented Camry off a dirt road and pointed a flashlight through a sheet of rain. It was his last stop on a trip to evaluate potential lease sites for grid storage ahead of a utility procurement — looking at available space, proximity to the grid, and stormwater characteristics. But once the utility saw the bids, it decided not to install any batteries after all.

“The storage market is built not only from Navigant reports but also from moments like that,” he said. ​“We had to lose a lot of projects before we started winning.”

Now that same utility is putting out a call for storage near its substations — exactly the kind of setting Kathpal had toured in the rain all those years ago.

Indeed, many of the projects connected to the grid this year started with developers anticipating future grid needs and putting money on the line for storage back around the time ESA was formulating its big goal, said Aaron Zubaty, CEO of early storage developer Eolian.

“Eolian began developing projects around major metro areas in the western U.S. starting in 2016 and putting the queue positions in that then became operational in 2025,” Zubaty said. The 200-megawatt Seaside battery site at a substation in Portland, Oregon, is one example.

Storage market twists and turns

Though the storage industry pioneers somehow nailed the 35-gigawatt goal, market growth defied their expectations in several important ways.

ESA had expected more of a steady ramp to the 35 gigawatts, said Kelly Speakes-Backman, who served as its chief executive officer from 2017 to 2021. But the storage market ran into plenty of false starts, such as when states passed mandates to install batteries but never enforced them, and when federal regulators ordered wholesale markets to incorporate storage but regional implementation dragged on for years.

“Once it hit, it really hit,” Speakes-Backman said.

The regional breakdown of storage growth didn’t play out as ESA expected, either. The analysis anticipated that the Northeast would install more than 10 gigawatts, nearly as much as the Southwest (including California and Hawaii); after all, it noted, New England states had passed ​“aggressive greenhouse gas reduction policies.”

In fact, the Northeast has done exceedingly little to build large-scale storage. (Zubaty told me that ​“largely dysfunctional power markets combined with utilities that have excessive regulatory capture” thwarted many good battery projects there.)

But other regions surpassed ESA’s expectations. California, Texas, and Arizona alone hold roughly 80% of all U.S. battery storage capacity. This lopsided concentration of storage could be seen as a weakness of the industry. Noah Roberts, executive director of the recently formed Energy Storage Coalition, which advocates for storage in federal arenas, said the pattern reflects how storage has sprung up in spots that suffer acute grid stress.

“Where energy storage has been deployed to date, it is and has been concentrated in areas that have had the greatest reliability need,” he said. ​“That is Texas and California, where in the early 2020s there were blackouts or brownouts that were quite significant.”

Now, Roberts said, other regions can look at California and Texas for empirical data on how the storage influx has helped reliability while lowering grid costs, for instance by avoiding power scarcity during heat waves and pushing down peak prices. ​“We’re really seeing the broadening of the geographic footprint of energy storage deployment,” he said, to regions like the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, which are grappling with unanticipated load growth.

Indeed, the ESA did not foresee the artificial intelligence boom sending power demand through the roof. Instead, its report predicted, ​“Electrified transportation will likely provide the largest source of new system load.” Now the storage industry has emerged as the biggest player in constructing firm, on-demand power plants, at the exact time that rapid power construction has become the key limiting factor in the AI arms race.

The storage market outdid expectations in one other major way. In 2017 the storage industry was intently focused on getting batteries installed, not so much on where they came from. Since then, bipartisan sentiment has shifted from unfettered global trade to a distinct preference for American manufacturing. The U.S. has made batteries for electric vehicles for years now, but the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries favored for grid storage have come almost exclusively from China. Now manufacturers are opening domestic cell production for grid storage, just in time for new rules that constrain federal tax credits for battery projects with too much material from China.

LG Energy Solution opened a factory to produce battery cells for grid storage in Michigan this summer that is capable of producing up to 16.5 gigawatt-hours at full capacity; the company expects to raise that capacity to 40 gigawatt-hours by the end of 2026. ​“All of our projects integrated before 2022 combined are smaller than some of our newer individual projects,” noted Tristan Doherty, chief product officer of LG Energy Solution subsidiary Vertech, which focuses on grid batteries.

Tesla is opening domestic LFP battery fabrication in 2026. Fluence announced the first shipment of its ​“domestically manufactured energy storage system” in September. Newcomers with novel chemistries for longer-duration storage are joining the fray, such as Form Energy and Eos Energy, both of which operate factories outside Pittsburgh.

“By the end of next year, we anticipate reaching the milestone of producing as many domestic energy storage battery cells as we need for demand,” Roberts said. ​“That is a pretty miraculous story that not many industries have the ability to say they’re able to accomplish.”

The storage industry was vindicated in stretching its aspirations beyond what many thought was possible. Those early adopters knew their technology was valuable, but even they didn’t guess how it would connect with the generational forces reshaping the U.S. economy, from AI to the onshoring of industry.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Grid-batteries_GettyImages-2198226931.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=238e5b63f4e87e18c321ae231d2ec684,N,,2025-12-04 07:58:50.980878

Turkey has imported 5.2 million tons of LNG so far this year, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF.","Turkey is exploring investments in US oil and gas fields as it accelerates a sweeping overhaul of its energy portfolio that’s so far been built around American LNG.

Turkish Petroleum Corp. is in talks with Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and other US majors to take positions in upstream assets, as part of Turkey’s plan to expand from its growing exposure to liquefied natural gas, the country’s Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said Wednesday on the sidelines of the World LNG summit in Istanbul. Announcements might come as early as next month, he said.

The plan adds a new layer to Turkey’s expanding relationship with the US, which has become a major source of long-term gas supply to Ankara. While Turkey is looking to secure access to fuels that are key to power the energy-hungry $1.4 trillion economy and diversify sources away from Russia and Azerbaijan, it’s also a way for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to boost influence and build economic relationships.

The country has done LNG deals with companies including Mercuria Energy Group and Woodside Energy Group Ltd. for LNG supply, mainly from plants in the US. This week, it agreed 10-year contracts with Eni SpA and Germany’s SEFE.

Turkey has signed 150 billion cubic meters of long-term LNG agreements since late 2024, with much of the supply starting between 2027 and 2030. Bayraktar said US LNG has become “more competitive” than pipeline gas from Russia and Iran.

Turkey has imported 5.2 million tons of LNG so far this year, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF. That compares with 3.98 million tons for all of 2024. Additional supply also gives Turkish companies the option to boost gas trading to maximize profits.

Bayraktar said the country expects to take about 1,500 LNG cargoes over the next 10–15 years, with most indexed to Henry Hub gas pricing in the US.

To accommodate rising imports, Turkey plans to add two new floating storage and regasification units, expanding its fleet to five. Ankara plans to send one of these units to Egypt for the summer months to help cover Cairo’s seasonal gas shortages and is in talks with other countries, including Morocco, for similar arrangements.

Bayraktar also said Turkey could double annual gas transfer capacity to Bulgaria to as much as 7–10 billion cubic meters, pending minor upgrades on the Bulgarian side. That could unlock additional volumes for Southeast Europe and potentially for Ukraine.

Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit.

The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities.

“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?”

The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs.

Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.

The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.

In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas.

The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January.

Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document.

The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”

Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.

“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.

The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks.

“They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is.

On Monday, Wolfspeed announced it received nearly $700 million in tax refunds through a provision of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act that subsidizes investments associated with qualifying U.S. semiconductor manufacturing projects. Wolfspeed has sought this 25% tax rebate after spending billions on a materials plant near Siler City.

The company anticipates seeing around $1 billion total through this subsidy, which is administered by the IRS and is separate from the $750 million CHIPS grant the government awarded Wolfspeed last year — money the chipmaker has not yet received.

Wolfspeed started production furnaces at its Siler City factory last year but has fallen far short of the 1,800 workers it had initially projected to hire there.

The company produces a unique semiconductor made from silicon carbide that is used in electric vehicles and other applications. Facing mounting debt and a slower-than-expected EV market, Wolfspeed began mass layoffs in the summer of 2024, which affected nearly one-third of its 5,000 employees, before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this June. It exited bankruptcy court in late September under a restructuring agreement that erased 70% of what it owed creditors.

In a statement Monday, Wolfspeed said it now has roughly $1.5 billion in cash reserves as it looks to extend its focus beyond electric vehicles to include more data centers, energy and defense applications.

“This substantial cash infusion further strengthens our liquidity position at a critical phase in Wolfspeed’s strategic evolution,” the company’s chief financial officer, Gregor Van Issum, wrote.

Founded in 1987, Wolfspeed remains one of the Triangle’s biggest and oldest tech employers.

Through the CHIPS tax rebate, it says it will continue to transition away from 150-millimeter substrates, or wafers, and toward larger 200-millimeter substrates that offer greater yields and potential cost-savings. The chipmaker plans to shut its 150-millimeter wafer factory in Durham by the end of this month.

Wolfspeed also fabricates chips at its plant in New York State’s Mohawk Valley.

Out of bankruptcy, the company still faces challenges due to the size of its factories. Demand for its silicon carbide chips continues to lag its facility space, the company reported in October, resulting in $47 million in underutilization costs at its New York State and Siler City plants.

Essentially, AI is a race that America doesn't want to lose. Of course, AI consumes a significant amount of energy, to the point that data center power consumption has become an increasingly contentious issue.

U.S. energy dominance is a key pillar of the Genesis Mission, which aims to power AI, modernize the power grid, and provide Americans with affordable and reliable energy.

Here are five energy stocks that could see tremendous growth opportunities as these developments unfold on America's path to becoming the world's AI leader over the coming years.

1. Constellation Energy

One of America's largest clean energy producers, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG), has a capacity of over 32,400 megawatts. It powers approximately 20 million homes and businesses. It's also the country's largest nuclear power plant operator. The Genesis Mission announcement specifically referenced nuclear energy, which is clean and highly efficient, despite its tainted reputation from past incidents.

The Trump Administration has already supported Constellation Energy by supplying a $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart its shuttered Three Mile Island reactor for a power purchase agreement with Microsoft. It will power the tech giant's data centers. It signals what could be the start of a revival for domestic nuclear energy generation.

2. NextEra Energy

An emphasis on U.S. energy independence bodes well for NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). It operates America's largest electric utility, Florida Power & Light. The company is also a global leader in renewable power generation and storage. It boasts a total capacity of 33,410 megawatts across nuclear, natural gas, wind, solar, and battery storage.

The company is investing $75 billion in infrastructure for power generation and transmission between now and 2028 to meet high demand as data centers continue to put pressure on the electric grid. NextEra Energy has already enjoyed decades of steady growth, evidenced by 30 consecutive annual dividend increases. An emphasis on domestic energy should help continue NextEra's success.

3. Dominion Energy

The proximity to the federal government, combined with the presence of deep-sea cables, makes Northern Virginia a hotspot for data centers. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is one of the country's largest producers of offshore wind and solar energy, and operates a utility business that delivers power throughout Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

Dominion Energy is reportedly in contract talks with data center companies on agreements totaling 47,000 megawatts of power. All these opportunities will likely create an enormous project pipeline for growth as the company invests in expanding its capacity, and makes Dominion Energy a no-brainer as a winner in the domestic energy push moving forward.

Despite the turbulence, industry leaders said they see a bright future for hydrogen in Ohio.

“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio. In his view, federal funding ​“makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”

Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.

Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.

There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.

“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.

Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.

Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen.

Some 800 in all, those products are used for water treatment, industrial chemical processes and the systems used in cool power plants and AI data centers, as well as in more familiar settings like the hospitality industry.

Ecolab is the biggest U.S.-based player spanning the cleaning, sanitation and water management business. Analysts estimate it controls nearly 10% of a $165 billion global market. And about 10% of its products are only made in Louisiana.

The petrochemical giant and its subsidiaries have faced criticism from environmentalists and paid out more than $2 million in fines to environmental regulators for violations in other states, though it has a maintained relatively clean record at its Garyville plant.

Now, amid the rush to build massive data centers to support the AI industry, Ecolab is positioned to profit from the growing demand for its specialized treatments for cooling water — both at the centers themselves and the power plants being built to electrify them.

“Those data centers are going to use a tremendous amount of water in their processes,” plant manager Chris Rogers said. “So the chemicals that we use allow for water to be used much more efficiently and effectively — and in environmentally friendly ways.”

How it's made

Chemicals manufactured at the Garyville facility include polymers used in wastewater treatment to help clump and remove solids, in paper processing to make more absorbent paper towels or stronger cardboard and to keep contaminants and corrosion from building up in machinery.

The plant also produces biocides — chemicals used to kill bacteria and fungi — and salt-based chemicals.

Water-oil blends, used to improve fuel quality and refinery efficiency, comprise about 40% of the Garyville plant’s output. Another 35% is made up of latex polymers and solution polymers for use in industrial wastewater treatment.

Raw materials arrive at the plant in bulk on railcars, though some arrive in smaller containers on box trucks, Rogers said.

“The types of materials that we use are everything from monomer backbones that go into making polymers, to some polymers that are pre-produced that we blend and mix with our polymers,” he said. “There are other salts and additive chemicals that we use to perfect our product.”

Depending on the type of product being made, those raw materials are taken to either reactors or blenders, which can be as small as a couple hundred gallons or as large as several thousand gallons.

Some of its products are manufactured through a continuous reaction process, which involves constantly feeding materials into the reactor as products flow out, Rogers explained.

“As long as we want to run it, as long as we have a need for that material, we could run for days, weeks, even months straight, where you're putting raw materials into the process and taking finished goods out,” he said.

Other products made at the plant are produced in batches, which can take anywhere from minutes to three days.

Neighbors among clients

The Garyville plant was built in 1970 by Nalco Water, which became a subsidiary of Minnesota-based publicly traded Ecolab in 2011. The following year, the new owners expanded the facility with a 300,000-square-foot polymer production facility.

Today, Ecolab has 110 manufacturing centers, 48,000 employees and operates across 170 countries and 40 different industries. In 2024, the publicly traded company earned $2.1 billion in profits on $15.7 billion in sales.

Of its 1,400 customers, more than half are based between Alabama and Texas, with nearly 300 in Louisiana.

“We've got another facility next door to us that we do business with,” Rogers said. “We've got facilities down the road that we do business with.”

The plant’s location along the Mississippi River affords it a huge advantage, he added.

“We pull the industrial water we use out of the Mississippi River, clean that water for usage within our facility. And then, once we use it in our facility, we clean it again before we put it back into the Mississippi,” he said.

Since 2018, the Garyville facility has maintained certification from the Alliance for Water Stewardship, an independent nonprofit made up of businesses, governmental, environmental and academic institutions. The certification means the plant has met standards for sustainable water management — reducing water use, ensuring water quality and protecting local watersheds.

Cooling the boom

The rapid pace of growth in the AI data center sector — with $46 billion in construction spending projected for the year — means more potential customers for Ecolab’s products that prevent scale and other residue from building up on the cooling equipment.

“When you prevent that, it allows for less electricity to be used to circulate and re-cool that cooling water,” Rogers said. “It also allows for that water to be used more efficiently itself.”

Large data centers can go through several millions of gallons of water every day, and the massive Meta facility being built in Richland Parish is projected to use even more, raising concerns among environmentalists about the impact on the area's water supply.

Cooling systems require make-up water to replace what escapes through evaporation and exhaust, and chemicals produced at the Garyville plant reduce the amount of replacement water needed.

Looking to the future, Ecolab officials expect the AI boom will continue to be big business for the company. This month, they announced plans to sell an integrated “cooling as a service” program that continuously checks the health and temperature of cooling liquid in real time.

“Data centers are at the heart of an AI-driven future, and their cooling needs are becoming increasingly complex,” Josh Magnuson, executive vice president and general manager for Ecolab’s Global Water Solutions sector, said in a statement. “Cooling as a Service is not just a platform but will be a dynamic hub that integrates cooling and power infrastructure to provide data center operators with the insights to achieve best-in-class performance.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/08/40894f89-cd6f-5b00-8fea-411d8188875c/691b9f908a972.image.jpg?crop=1690%2C887%2C0%2C169&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-04 07:59:27.579849

Patrick A. Nye is a licensed Texas professional geoscientist and co-founder of the Ingleside on the Bay Coastal Watch Association.","The Coastal Bend is a special region, defined by its natural beauty and generations of families who have built their lives between the bays and the brush country. My parents bought a small bay house on Mother’s Day 58 years ago, where my brothers and I learned to fish and explore the spoil islands. Having grown up in Ingleside on the Bay, my wife and I wanted our children and grandchildren to experience the same beauty and freedom we did.But over the years, we’ve watched our bay suffer from one industrial project after another. That’s why we helped found the Coastal Watch Association — to give our community a voice. Like our neighbors, we want safe schools, clean air, good jobs and a strong local economy.

Yet Project YaREN, a proposed ammonia export facility, threatens to undo everything that makes this region worth protecting. Proponents of the project claim it will be “clean” and represents “progress,” but the facts tell a different story.The reality is that living near an industrial ammonia facility is inherently dangerous. Ammonia is a toxic chemical that can cause burns, respiratory failure and death even at low concentrations. A single leak can form dense, ground-level clouds that travel long distances, endangering entire neighborhoods. According to a national watchdog analysis published in 2013, nearly 1,000 accidents had occurred at U.S. anhydrous-ammonia facilities over the prior 15 years. Schools, homes and first responders within a few miles of ammonia facilities face heightened risks of exposure and evacuation events. When a plant like Project YaREN is sited less than 2 miles from an elementary school, that danger is not theoretical; it’s personal.

Claims have been made that “hundreds” of residents support Project YaREN. In reality, CWA’s petition opposing the plant has gathered more than 500 signatures from people living nearby (within a 2-mile radius of the proposed site, over 1,900 residents — including the students and staff of Ingleside Primary School — would be directly affected). And nearly 200 residents have filed as affected parties in the state’s contested case hearing opposing the project’s air permit, where they’ll have the chance to speak to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality about their concerns.Project YaREN says it will capture 95% of the 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide it produces and store it underground. If that happens, the companies behind the plant, Yara and Enbridge, would receive $247 million in U.S. taxpayer subsidies. That’s right: Nearly a quarter-billion dollars from American taxpayers would go to two foreign corporations so they can pollute our air and water, export their product overseas and pocket the profits. Meanwhile, our community pays the price with higher health risks and a diminished quality of life.Some insist that “TCEQ will ensure our safety.” But TCEQ is in the business of approving air or water permits, no matter how polluting. And history tells us not to rely on corporate promises. Yara’s ammonia plant in Trinidad polluted Lisas Bay so badly that local seafood developed cancerous lesions and deformities. Enbridge, meanwhile, is responsible for the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history.

Even without an accident, daily operations of Project YaREN would expose Ingleside and surrounding communities to toxic air emissions — over 18,000 million pounds of new pollutants every day, according to their permit applications. Our area already struggles with high levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) — a pollutant linked to asthma, heart disease and cancer.

Because TCEQ has no air monitors in San Patricio County, CWA launched a “citizen science” initiative with the University of Texas at Arlington to fill the gap. These community monitors regularly detect pollution spikes from existing industrial sites. Yet when CWA asked Enbridge to share its own fence-line data during a TCEQ public hearing, they refused. If this is their idea of transparency, how can residents trust anything they say?The choice we face on Project YaREN is not between jobs or the environment. It’s between a future where foreign corporations receive massive tax subsidies to profit from our coastline, or one where the Coastal Bend remains a safe, livable place for generations to come. Clean air and water are not luxuries — they are the foundation of a healthy economy and community. Project YaREN jeopardizes both.

For decades, families like mine have invested our lives in this region — not for short-term gain but for the promise of a future built on beauty, balance and belonging. That promise is worth defending.

The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said.
The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles.
Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Rule change will save money, Trump says

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes. They had complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback in mileage standards.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program.

Polluting cars to stay on road

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and more 4,870 tons a year of smog components nitrogen oxide volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

DTE Electric has asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast-track approval for its plan to power the data center. That would bypass a process called a ""contested case"" that requires the commission to consider evidence and testimony from a variety of sources.

DTE has said it expects the facility to increase its current peak electrical load by about 25%, but building out the capacity to accommodate that demand would not affect current ratepayers. The utility said it's reached contracts with the companies behind the data center that would protect current customers from subsidizing the project.

Nichole Biber, a member of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to probe DTE’s claims. ""These meaningful guardrails, from what I've heard so far, are all on the assurances of DTE and the multibillion dollar corporations that are pushing AI and data centers on us. That does not reassure me,"" she said.

Most of the participants at the online hearing said they wanted more transparency around the project.

Cody Gilbert of Cadillac also spoke at the hearing, voicing concern about how the data center would affect the state’s goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050.

""A project that uses thousands of gallons of water and tons of electricity, enough for thousands of homes is is not advancing that goal,"" Gilbert said.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer submitted a comment urging the commission to approve plans for the project. She called it ""the largest business investment in Michigan’s history""

A small number of state-level greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting programs exist currently, but more are emerging in response to a potential repeal of the federal GHGRP. This analysis compares cost estimates for state reporting programs to cost estimates for the federal program to better evaluate their impact.

Background

Currently, the federal government requires all stationary facilities with an annual GHG emission rate greater than 25,000 metric tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) to report their emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The GHGRP was finalized in 2009, and data collection began in 2010. In response to a methane fee implemented as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the program’s coverage of emitter types expanded in 2024 to facilitate fee application. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed the methane fee in July 2025, and the administration proposed repealing the GHGRP in September.

A handful of states already have their own reporting programs. California first proposed its Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Regulation (MRR) in 2007. The MRR, as initially proposed, had a reporting threshold of 25,000 Mt CO2e, though the current MRR has a reporting threshold of 10,000 Mt CO2e. Washington also has a GHG reporting program, first proposed in 2010, with a reporting threshold of 10,000 Mt CO2e. Oregon has its own program as well, albeit with an exceptionally low threshold of 2,500 Mt CO2e. And New York proposed a reporting program with a threshold of 10,000 Mt CO2e just this year.

Many facilities operating in states without reporting programs must still monitor and report their emissions as part of other climate-related laws. For example, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) imposes emission requirements on power plants in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Providers in these states must continue to monitor emissions even if the GHGRP is repealed.

Related to state-level GHG reporting programs, several states—including Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Washington—have proposed implementing “climate disclosure” requirements for firms headquartered there. (California already has a climate disclosure law in place.) While these requirements primarily apply based on a firm’s book value rather than its emissions, they do overlap with the compliance burdens involved in data collection for GHG reporting programs.

Additionally, firms that would otherwise report data to the federal government under the GHGRP may find themselves reporting data to facilitate the necessary disclosure requirements of customers subject to higher “scopes” of emissions that include upstream sources.

State Reporting Programs Likely to Cost More

Because states do not have the same requirements for regulatory cost benefit analysis that exist at the federal level, it can be challenging to compare the quality of federal regulations to state-level counterparts. However, in the case of California’s initial proposal for the MRR a cost-benefit analysis was published. With the costs estimated around a 25,000 Mt CO2e threshold, it is possible to compare the cost of the state-designed program with the federal GHGRP.

Figure 1 details the cost of GHG reporting on a per-ton basis for four estimates: The initially estimated cost of the GHGRP in 2009, the estimated cost of the GHGRP before the 2024 modifications, the estimated cost of the GHGRP after the 2024 modifications, and the estimated cost of the MRR in 2007.

FIGURE 1: Cost Comparison of Federal and California Reporting Programs

The data reveals a couple salient points. The first is that the 2024 changes substantially increased program costs, particularly relative to estimated emissions. This is because the modifications—designed to facilitate compliance with a methane fee—expanded coverage to small and/or irregular emissions that may require more resources to monitor and report relative to the mass of emission.

The second key point is that compliance with California’s MRR is considerably more expensive per ton of reported emissions than the GHGRP (prior to modification, at least). Given the considerable gap in cost between the pre-2024 GHGRP and the MRR, firms potentially covered under future state programs should expect compliance to be more costly.

State Reporting Programs Require More Reporters

The federal GHGRP’s reporting threshold of 25,000 Mt CO2e was chosen based on the understanding that there are diminishing returns from lower thresholds as the number of reporters increases disproportionately relative to the increase in emissions reported. Figure 2 shows the estimated increase in reporters based on emission thresholds required for reporting 100,000 to 1,000 Mt CO2 per year.

FIGURE 2: Number of Reporting Entities at Various Emission Thresholds

The number of reporting entities also has a considerable impact on the estimated compliance cost. But because the newly covered emitters are smaller, the level of emissions covered is much lower. Figure 3 shows the EPA’s estimated changes in GHGRP compliance costs and emission coverage at various emission reporting thresholds.

FIGURE 3: GHGRP Costs and Emission Coverage at Various Emission Thresholds

Unsurprisingly, there is virtually no change in reported emissions at lower thresholds despite significantly increased compliance costs. Note that the EPA estimated a 33 percent higher compliance cost between the 25,000 and 10,000 Mt CO2e thresholds.

This raises concerns related to state GHG reporting programs. Since there is currently no reason for state programs to have less stringent thresholds than the GHGRP, the only examples we currently have are actually more stringent. Should other states develop their own reporting programs, they may be more inclined to set lower emission thresholds than the current federal requirement.

The marginal cost of lower reporting thresholds relative to reported emissions is exceptionally large. Figure 4 shows the EPA’s increased marginal cost from lowering the reporting threshold alongside the estimated cost of Washington’s marginally lower threshold (under both a low-end and high-end estimate).

FIGURE 4: Marginal Cost Increase from Lowering Reporting Thresholds

Put simply, each threshold reduction brings a marginally more expensive metric ton of GHG to report.

100,000 to 25,000 Mt CO2e per year: $0.35 average increase per metric ton

25,000 to 10,000 Mt CO2e per year: $1.42 average increase per metric ton

10,000 to 1,000 Mt CO2e per year: $3.97 average increase per metric ton

In Washington, where the state reporting program functionally lowers the threshold from the federal requirement of 25,000 Mt CO2e to 10,000 Mt CO2e per year, the marginal cost to report new emissions is between $0.75 and $1.65 per metric ton.

The takeaway is that a reporting program that expansively covers many small emitters—a general trend among states—is considerably more expensive. Furthermore, if states continue to develop their own GHG reporting programs in response to a repeal of the federal GHGRP, then facilities that would not have had to report their emissions to anyone before may need to begin doing so.

Other Concerns

Policymakers should also bear in mind two theoretical concerns for which limited data exists. The first is the risk of exposure to foreign reporting programs; the second is the risk of increased costs due to a complex patchwork of state-level requirements.

Risk of Exposure to Foreign Reporting Programs

Some foreign buyers of U.S. fossil fuels will be required to estimate the emissions involved in the import of such product. For example, beginning in 2027, the European Union will require energy companies to report the GHG emissions of imported U.S. product. Efforts were launched in 2024 to negotiate with the European Commission to allow the U.S. GHGRP to satisfy E.U. reporting requirements for foreign importers, although that can only occur if the GHGRP remains in force.

If U.S. energy exporters must comply with foreign requirements, then they may be forced into more costly compliance programs—or worse, governments may use a lack of emissions information to prevent trade agreements (see French company Engie as an example).

Increased Costs Due to Patchwork of State-Level Requirements

Another concern is that a surge in new state-level reporting programs could substantially increase the relative compliance costs for many firms, particularly those operating in multiple states. While some firms operating in a single state without a reporting program would benefit from a repeal of the GHGRP, it is reasonable to expect that large firms may end up with increased costs (which may manifest in states that don’t have reporting requirements, as multi-state companies may spread distribute costs among all customers).

In other words, policymakers should not assume that a patchwork of reporting programs would affect only those states that adopt such policies. And since complying with multiple programs is likely to be costlier than a single program, some firms would likely face substantially higher costs relative to the federal program.

Conclusion

In terms of per-ton costs, the GHGRP is a relatively low-cost program (though modifications made under the Biden administration have significantly increased its estimated costs). If the GHGRP is repealed, states will likely increase efforts to develop their own GHG reporting programs. Existing state-level reporting programs are considerably more burdensome due to their estimated costs to firms as well as their likelihood of requiring more reporting entities than the federal program.

While it is unclear exactly how the EPA will modify the GHGRP, it may be worthwhile to consider options that reduce program costs instead of repealing it. This may be especially important if it becomes necessary for the federal government to implement regulation that preempts state-level requirements, as is often the case with other regulatory issues.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Coal-Plant-Power-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 12:01:18.754580

Kioxia, a leader in memory solutions, has begun offtake of its portion of the hydropower project's electricity, which is expected to reach 160 gigawatt-hour (GWh) per year (enough to power about 40,000 Japanese homes). This move directly supports Kioxia's goals of sourcing 100% renewable energy for use in its own business activity by fiscal year (""FY"") 2040 and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by FY2050. Kioxia's hydropower offtake, which provides ""round-the-clock"" clean power, also helps reduce Google's scope 3 emissions and support its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain.

Hydropower retrofits, which upgrade existing units of power-generation facilities to increase efficiency and power generation, offer a significant opportunity to expand renewable energy with minimal environmental impact. This project is strategically important for Kioxia in Japan, as the renewable electricity generated from these retrofitted facilities will enable Kioxia to improve its ability to sustainably power its operations in an area that faces challenges with decarbonization.

The project was enabled by a Google-led effort to bring additional, cost-efficient clean electricity to manufacturers in Japan.

This is the latest — and potentially last — turn in an eight-year legal fight over CITGO’s parent, PDV Holding, and names Elliott affiliate Amber Energy as the winning bidder for the plants, which have a combined refining capacity of more than 800 Mb/d. In today’s RBN blog, we’ll discuss Amber’s plans for the CITGO refineries.

Let’s start with some background. As we detailed in I’ll Be Around, there’s been a primarily below-the-radar battle playing out in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware since 2017 about how best to help satisfy the claims of a dozen-plus creditors who collectively lost more than $20 billion when the government of Venezuela — the de facto owner of CITGO Petroleum and its parent company, PDV Holding (PDVH) — defaulted on its bonds. (In 2019, control of CITGO was transferred away from the ruling Maduro regime in Venezuela to the opposition “shadow” government, then led by Juan Guaidó.) In May 2021, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard P. Stark appointed Robert B. Pincus as a special master tasked with devising a plan to sell PDVH/CITGO to satisfy at least some portion of the outstanding claims. After a two-round bidding process that concluded in June 2024, Pincus recommended in September 2024 that the district court approve Amber Energy and its $7.3 billion bid for CITGO and its three refineries (Lake Charles, LA; Lemont, IL; and Corpus Christi, TX). However, instead of ending the drama, the court restarted the bidding from scratch in December 2024, citing issues with the auction process.

As a result of the new bidding round, the court in July recommended a $7.4 billion bid from Dalinar Energy, the U.S. subsidiary of Canadian miner Gold Reserve. But by August 30, that deal was overtaken by what the court described as a “superior” proposal from Amber Energy — even though its bid included less cash. (Amber’s offer included $5.86 billion in cash and $2.86 billion in strategic debt settlements; together with $105 million of break fees paid to writ holders, it equates to a total value of $8.821 billion.) Pincus approved Amber’s bid, saying that Dalinar’s proposal did not match or exceed it despite a last-minute attempt to improve the terms (Dalinar later raised its bid to $7.9 billion).

Earlier this fall, several parties were pushing to scrap the auction and start from scratch (again). Judge Stark heard testimony on October 21-22 from CITGO, PDVH and the Venezuelan government, which argued that Amber Energy’s bid was far too low. But on November 25, Stark dismissed the objections and gave Amber the green light, giving parties until November 28 to submit any remaining objections. Several entities filed objections, but the court entered a sale order on November 29 authorizing the transfer of PDVH’s shares to Amber. The transfer is subject to U.S. regulatory and Treasury Department approvals and could face appeals by Venezuela and other parties. The sale is expected to close next year, assuming the required approvals are obtained and any appeals do not result in a reversal. Then, proceeds will be distributed to Venezuela‑linked creditors in line with the court’s priority schedule.

Before we dive into Amber Energy’s plan, let’s briefly highlight each refinery. The 479-Mb/d Lake Charles Refinery in southwestern Louisiana (refinery icon at bottom of Figure 1 below) is the seventh-largest in the U.S. and CITGO’s most valuable asset. Using various criteria, RBN’s Refined Fuels Analytics (RFA) practice ranks it among the 10 most competitive refineries along the Gulf Coast. The Lake Charles facility is highly complex, with a broad range of downstream processing units, which allow it to profitably process a wide variety of crudes and other feedstocks into valuable refined products, including various grades of gasoline, jet fuel, ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), benzene, propylene and other products. Also, the refinery’s multiple processing trains give it significant additional operating flexibility, enhancing its ability to respond effectively to changing market conditions and crude and product differentials. CITGO completed a very cost-effective, 38-Mb/d expansion of the refinery in Q1 2023 and recently increased capacity by another 16 Mb/d in a similarly efficient way to reach its current level as it continues to invest in the facility to improve its capabilities, competitiveness and market responsiveness.",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2025-12/Fig1_CITGO%27s%20Refineries%2C%20Lubricant%20Plants%2C%20Terminals%20and%20Pipelines.png?itok=aFs-BDre,N,,2025-12-04 03:00:21.385797

On September 5, 2025, the Government of Canada announced its intent to make targeted amendments to the Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) to strengthen the resiliency and support the development of Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector, while maintaining the Regulations’ primary focus on lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and transitioning to a low carbon economy.

Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is publishing this Discussion Paper to invite views and information related to these targeted amendments. The comment period will close January 15, 2026. Information on how to submit comments is provided at the end of the paper.

Context

The Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) require producers and importers of gasoline and diesel (i.e. primary suppliers) to reduce the life cycle carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel produced and imported for use in Canada, thereby reducing GHG emissions. A life cycle approach considers the GHG emissions involved in multiple stages of the fuel’s production process, from feedstock extraction or cultivation to fuel combustion. Reduction requirements for primary suppliers took effect as of July 1, 2023. The CFR is an important part of Canada’s climate competitiveness strategy -- reducing emissions, accelerating the use of clean technologies and fuels, and supporting sustainable jobs in a diversified economy. It is the main federal measure creating demand for clean fuels in the Canadian market and complements the various clean fuel policies and regulations in the provinces and territories.

The CFR establishes a credit market, where each credit represents a life cycle emission reduction of one tonne of CO2e. Regulated parties meet their obligations via credits which they create themselves or buy on the CFR credit market. Credits can be created by:

compliance category 1 – undertaking projects that reduce the life cycle carbon intensity of liquid fossil fuels (e.g. carbon capture and storage, renewable electricity, co-processing)

compliance category 2 – supplying low-carbon intensity fuels (e.g. ethanol, biodiesel)

compliance category 3 – supplying fuel or energy to advanced vehicle technology (e.g. electricity or hydrogen in vehicles)

The majority of credits created to-date under the CFR come from the supply of low-carbon intensity fuelsFootnote 1. While an important share of these credits comes from fuel produced in Canada, Canada does not currently produce enough low-carbon intensity fuels to meet the total domestic demand. As such, a large share of CFR credits for low-carbon intensity fuel supply come from imports, mostly from the United States (US) (Annex 1)Footnote 2.

Canada’s liquid low-carbon intensity fuel production is split between a relatively small number of facilities (see Annex 2 for more information on the sector). There are twelve ethanol facilities, six biodiesel facilities and three renewable diesel facilities, including one that focuses mainly on exports. Six refineries have indicated interest in co-processing low-carbon feedstock along with crude oil by 2030, with some of them already creating credits under the CFR. There are currently 48 Canadian facilities registered under the CFR, which produce biogas, renewable natural gas, hydrogen or renewable propane. In 2024, 1.3% of the credits created were for low-carbon-intensity gaseous fuels. Domestic feedstocks are used to produce about 41-66% of Canadian liquid low-carbon intensity fuels used to create CFR credits. For canola specifically, 90% of domestically produced biomass-based diesel was produced from Canadian canola. Demand for ethanol and biomass-based diesel has grown significantly over recent years and is projected to continue growing out to 2030.

Canadian biofuel producers, and their supply chains, are facing competitiveness and trade challenges, which are putting their operations at risk. This could result in less supply of domestic low-carbon intensity fuels, putting future emission reductions at risk, deepening Canada’s reliance on imports, including from the US, and dampening demand for domestic agricultural feedstocks like canola.

In this context, the Government of Canada announced (Sept. 5, 2025) it will make targeted amendments to the CFR to strengthen the resiliency and support the development of Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector, while maintaining the Regulations’ primary focus on lowering GHG emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The targeted amendments will ensure the Canadian market is able to continue supplying material and reliable quantities of low-carbon intensity fuels. This will help to ensure the CFR can continue to deliver emission reductions. By creating more demand for Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels, the targeted amendments will support Canada’s agriculture producers – such as canola – whose crops are a key feedstock in the production of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels.

The targeted CFR amendments will complement Canada’s recently announced Biofuels Production Incentive, which will provide over $372 million over two years to support the stability and resiliency of domestic producers of biodiesel and renewable diesel. The Government will also work closely with provinces and territories to explore a more comprehensive approach to growing the domestic low-carbon fuel sector and ensuring its longer-term competitiveness.

A number of provinces have also taken action. In February 2025, the Government of British Columbia published amendments to their Low Carbon Fuel Standard, requiring a minimum percentage of renewable fuels to be from domestically produced biofuel (i.e. 8% Canadian renewable content in diesel, starting April 1, 2025; 5% Canadian renewable content in gasoline, starting January 1, 2026). On August 7, 2025, the Government of Ontario finalized regulatory amendments mandating that at least 75% of the renewable content required in diesel fuel and 64% of the renewable content required in gasoline be produced in Canada. Quebec is the only province with a low-carbon fuel production tax credit. In 2024, the Government of Quebec modified the credit to ensure low-carbon intensity fuel facilities in Quebec could remain competitive.

CFR amendments

This paper outlines two regulatory options to achieve this goal, however ECCC welcomes input on other design options and considerations.

Regulatory approach

Minimum domestic content approach

The CFR currently requires primary suppliers to incorporate a minimum of 5% low-carbon intensity fuel content in the total volume of gasoline produced and imported for use in Canada, and 2% in diesel (sections 6 and 7 of the Regulations). Under this approach, the volumetric requirements of the CFR could be amended to require that a minimum volumetric requirement be met with low-carbon intensity fuel produced in Canada. Implemented similarly to the volumetric requirements currently set in the CFR, a minimum volume of domestic low-carbon intensity fuel content could be set for gasoline and for diesel. This approach would require primary suppliers to demonstrate that low-carbon intensity fuels produced in Canada represent a certain percentage of their regulated volume of gasoline and diesel.

A minimum content approach could guarantee a market for a significant portion of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuel production while allowing the remaining demand to be met with imports. By creating more demand for Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels, the targeted amendments will support Canada’s agriculture producers, whose crops are a key feedstock in the production of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuels.

Minimum domestic content requirements would be set high enough to provide a market for a significant portion of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuel production. However, the requirements would need to provide some flexibility to account for unforeseen circumstances (e.g. closure of a low-carbon intensity fuel production facility), regional considerations and unequal access to low-carbon intensity fuels across Canada.

Key questions on the regulatory approach

What design would best meet the objective of the amendments:

a minimum domestic content, a credit multiplier, or another potential design?

Should a combination of options be used?

Should the targeted amendment be a temporary measure or longer-term?

If a minimum domestic content approach is recommended, should the requirements remain stable or increase over time?

Under a minimum domestic content approach, what percentage of the respective gasoline and diesel CFR regulated volumes is recommended?

Are there special circumstances, cases or exceptions that should be taken into consideration if a minimum domestic content approach is taken?

Considering the different costs and challenges for each type of fuel, if a credit multiplier approach is taken, should there be a differentiated rate set for each type of domestic low-carbon intensity fuel? If so, what multiplication rate is recommended for each type of fuel?

If a credit multiplier approach is taken, how could it be designed to prevent it from creating an oversupply of credits or depressing the credit price?

Are there other elements, data or information that should be considered?

Scope

A number of different types of low-carbon intensity fuels are produced in Canada and are eligible for credit creation under the CFR.

Under the CFR, credits for liquid low-carbon fuels are created predominantly via Compliance Category 2 (i.e. sections 94-97 of the CFR). Liquid low-carbon intensity fuels for which credits have been created include ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel and pyrolysis oil. Under Compliance Category 1, specific to low-carbon intensity fuels, credits can also be created for co-processing low-carbon intensity feedstocks along with crude oil at refineries, which requires the use of a Quantification Method, a project application and the recognition of the co-processing project. While the number of credits created based on the production of co-processed fuels in 2024 was a small portion of the total number credits created that year, the production of co-processed fuels at refineries has the potential to increase significantly in future years. This, in turn, would be expected to increase the demand for low-carbon intensity fuel feedstock such as canola oil.

Credits can be created in respect of gaseous low-carbon intensity fuels produced and imported for use in Canada (i.e. biogas, renewable natural gas, hydrogen, renewable propane). These gaseous credits can be used to satisfy up to 10% of a primary supplier’s annual reduction requirements.

ECCC is seeking input on which fuels should be in scope for the targeted amendments.

Key questions on scope

Which fuels should be in scope?

What considerations should inform which fuels would be in scope?

Special circumstances and exemptions

Depending on the design, it may be relevant to consider the regional variations and different circumstances of certain primary suppliers, such as exclusive importers.

If we take the example of minimum domestic content requirements, a minimum threshold for the obligated gasoline and diesel pools could be set to exempt lower volume suppliers. Alternatively, another option could be to calculate the minimum domestic content requirements as a function of the size of a primary supplier’s obligated poolFootnote 3 .

Depending on the approach taken, ECCC may also consider further compliance flexibility as part of the targeted amendments. For example, a mechanism to mitigate potential risks to fuel supply could be considered in a scenario where there was insufficient domestic low-carbon intensity fuel supply to comply with the CFR requirements due to unforeseen circumstances.

Key questions on special circumstances & exemptions

If minimum domestic content requirement or other mandatory requirements are set, should the requirement be the same for all primary suppliers?

Are there specific criteria, considerations or circumstances that could justify setting different requirements that should be taken into account?

Should the requirements be set only above a minimum volume threshold (i.e. domestic requirements would only apply to primary suppliers who supply more than a minimum amount of gasoline or diesel)?

If so, what threshold do you recommend?

Should the requirements be progressive and / or be calculated as a function of the size of the primary supplier’s obligated pool (e.g. lower percentage of domestic content requirement for small pool vs higher percentage of domestic content requirement for big pool)?

Should a special clause or mechanism be integrated in the amendments to provide additional flexibility in the case where the domestic low-carbon intensity fuel supply is insufficient to meet the minimum domestic content requirement?

How should this be designed?

Maintaining focus on emission reductions and transition to a low-carbon economy

The primary objectives of the CFR are to reduce GHG emissions by reducing the lifecycle carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel produced and imported for use in Canada, and transition to a low-carbon economy. The targeted amendment will maintain these primary objectives. To do so:

the targeted amendment will ensure the Canadian market is able to continue supplying material and reliable quantities of low-carbon intensity fuel and can continue to deliver significant emission reductions

credits for all low-carbon intensity fuel will continue to be created based on the life cycle carbon intensity determined using the Fuel LCA Model to reward fuels with the lowest carbon intensity

low-carbon intensity fuels (those derived from biomass) will continue to be subjected to the land use and biodiversity criteria of the CFR

Information requested

ECCC is gathering data and undertaking analysis to ensure that the targeted amendments will support Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector while maintaining the Regulations’ primary focus on lowering carbon emissions. To support this, ECCC invites stakeholders with access to relevant information and data to share this with ECCC, including the data and inputs outlined below.

Additional input requested

For primary suppliers, what are your constraints to obtaining Canadian-made low-carbon intensity fuel (e.g. transport, contracts, geographical concerns, specific constraints related to blending, etc.)?

What percentage of the CFR regulated volumes for gasoline and diesel do you think is achievable and why?

If physically procuring domestic low-carbon fuel is challenging, are there constraints to obtaining the credits created based on the production of domestic low-carbon fuels from the credit market instead?

If so, what are these?

For low-carbon intensity fuel producers, what measures would be sufficient to ensure you can continue to produce or stay competitive?

Recognizing this may vary by approach, how much time would you need after the publication of the amendments in Canada Gazette, Part II to implement the changes required in the amendments?

Do you have any other information or considerations to support the development of these targeted amendments to the CFR?

Next steps

The Government of Canada plans to move quickly to advance these amendments.

Your input is important as ECCC’s develops this amendment. Please submit your written comments on the above key considerations and questions by January 15, 2026.

Comments may be submitted by email to the following address:

Lisa Ryan, Acting Executive Director, Low Carbon Fuels Division

Email: cfsncp@ec.gc.ca

Building on the feedback received on this paper and through further consultations, ECCC will publish draft amendments in Canada Gazette, Part I. Only comments related to these targeted amendments will be considered at this time.

As a next step in the Government’s commitment to further examine concerns raised about potential compliance risks related to imported low carbon fuel feedstocks used for the CFR, including used cooking oil (UCO), the Government will assess the verification and certification requirements in other jurisdictions, as well as best practices regarding traceability, tracking, and data management across feedstock supply chains. ECCC welcomes input on other actions or steps relating to the treatment of imported low carbon fuel feedstocks, including UCO.

Annex II - Snapshot of Canadian low-carbon intensity fuel sector

Canada’s low-carbon intensity fuel production is split between a relatively small number of facilities.

**Statistic Canada, Table 25-10-0081-01

*** Canadian Gas Association, Innovation Hub. Facilities in operation in 2025 or before. The following energy density were used for conversion: 38 MJ/m3.

Ethanol

Ethanol represents Canada’s largest volume of low-carbon intensity fuel production, with a capacity of 1,869 ML across 12 facilities. Canada does not currently produce enough ethanol to meet the total domestic demand; 38% of the volume of ethanol used to create credits in 2024 was produced in Canada. While Canada’s ethanol production has been stable in recent years, Canadian ethanol sector has indicated it may start experiencing competitiveness problems in the near term. With policy changes passed in summer 2025 in the US, US-produced ethanol exported to Canada will now be eligible to receive US tax incentives, potentially making it harder for Canadian producers trying to compete on the Canadian market.

Biodiesel

Canada has six biodiesel facilities and sufficient domestic biodiesel production capacity to meet the current total domestic demand. However, until 2024, most of the biodiesel produced in Canada was exported to United States and was eligible to benefit from the now cancelled US Blender’s Tax Credit, where both biodiesel and renewable diesel imported into and produced in United States received a US$1 per gallon tax. Therefore, most of the biodiesel used in Canada was imported. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) replaced the Blender's Tax Credit with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit in 2025, which only applies to biodiesel and renewable diesel produced in United States, regardless of whether the fuel is used in United[LR2] [DA3] [EW4] States. The IRA tax credit made it virtually impossible for Canadian production to compete on the US or Canadian market, resulting in a temporary shut-down of several facilities.

However, recent actions taken by Provinces are starting to have an impact. As a result of the production tax credit in Quebec and the recent regulatory amendments in British Columbia and Ontario, some biodiesel facilities are resuming production. In the second quarter of 2025, four biodiesel facilities produced biodiesel in Canada and created CFR credits.

Renewable diesel

Canada’s renewable diesel industry is nascent. There are three domestic production facilities, including one that focuses on exports and another one that just started production in Summer 2025. Prior to the first Canadian facility starting production in 2023, all volumes of renewable diesel were imported.

Co-processing in refineries

Low-carbon intensity feedstock (e.g. canola oil) may be co-processed along crude oil at existing refineries to produce co-processed low-carbon intensity fuels (e.g. co-processed low-carbon intensity diesel, co-processed low-carbon intensity gasoline). Co-processing projects at four different refineries have been approved for credit creation under the CFR. In total, six refineries have indicated their interest in co-processing by 2030.

Low-carbon intensity gaseous fuels

There are currently 48 active Canadian facilities registered under the CFR, which produce biogas, renewable natural gas, hydrogen or renewable propane, but only 34 facilities have created credits to date. In 2024, 1.3% of the credits created were for low-carbon-intensity gaseous fuels. Many registered creators currently use default carbon intensity values that result in no or only a few credits. The number of credits is expected to increase in future years as carbon intensities determined with the Fuel LCA Model are more commonly used to create credits and new facilities come online.

The installed capacity of low-carbon intensity gaseous fuels is expected to grow quickly over the next few years. For instance, the Canadian Gas Association projects that the renewable natural gas capacity will grow from 9.3 PJ (244,737 ML) in 2023 to 28.9 PJ (760,526 ML) in 2026. There are also several hydrogen projects under development[DA5] [EW6] .

Feedstocks

About 41-66% of liquid low-carbon intensity fuels produced in Canada that create CFR credits is produced from Canadian feedstock, such as canola and corn. For domestically produced renewable diesel and biodiesel, 90% of the fuel was produced from Canadian canola.

Demand

Demand for ethanol and biomass-based diesel has grown significantly in recent years, driven by provincial and territorial policies, as well as the CFR. This demand is projected to continue to grow out to 2030 (Table 3).

Canadian production capacity of ethanol and co-processed low-carbon intensity gasoline represents 37% of the expected ethanol demand in 2030. Canadian production capacity of biodiesel, renewable diesel and co-processed low-carbon intensity diesel represents 59% of the expected biomass-based diesel demand in 2030.

Gov. Whitmer led effort to win funds, make Michigan the first state to restart a nuclear power plant

LANSING, Mich.—Today, Governor Whitmer released the following statement on the Department of Energy’s (DOE) announcement of a $400 million investment in Holtec to deploy two next generation small nuclear reactors (SMR) at the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, doubling the site’s generation capacity and providing enough power for 1.4 million households and businesses.

“Today’s announcement will lower energy costs, reaffirm Michigan’s clean energy leadership, and show the world that we are the best place to do business,” said Governor Whitmer. “This historic investment will double Palisades’ capacity, provide more clean energy for Michigan homes and businesses, and protect good-paying Michigan jobs. By restarting Palisades, we will make history as the first state to reopen a shuttered nuclear plant. I’ll keep working with anyone to grow Michigan’s economy and build a more affordable, clean energy future right here in Michigan. Let’s keep getting it done.”

DOE’s investment will help Holtec deploy two SMR-300 advanced nuclear reactors at Palisades generating 600 megawatts of safe, reliable, clean energy in addition to the 800 megawatts already generated by the site. Holtec is taking an innovative approach to nuclear reactor deployment at every stage in the process, from setting up the reactors to selling the electricity they generate. The State of Michigan was proud to support Holtec’s successful application for the DOE’s Gen III+ SMR program.

Palisades Nuclear Plant

Today’s investment builds on the announcement made last year to make Michigan the first state in the country to successfully reopen a shuttered nuclear power plant. The U.S. DOE finalized a $1.52 billion loan agreement with Holtec International to aid in the restart of the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant, and the USDA awarded over $1.3 billion to support the restoration of service at the plant and lower energy costs, including an over $650 million grant to Wolverine Power Cooperative to reduce the cost of power produced at Palisades.",https://scontent.fagc3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/594067554_706827279163523_5840372669025710376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_tt6&cstp=mx916x180&ctp=s916x180&_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=b96d88&_nc_ohc=Y-9r1UXhvHcQ7kNvwHM017d&_nc_oc=Adnxbi3bWqDkjcbwuMrlgKSBP8L1F9DP_NBwuwiSEAg_NbEcqwMmHRi_SaI6zrz_ii8dbUH8OI5zqb5GETf49nZF&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fagc3-2.fna&_nc_gid=IphzChXtsvQf7ypBgcBBLg&oh=00_AfmwQ2qZx6L46LNrgNKy6IdJKBDOUCXPmF2BXwERVI1hZQ&oe=69372196,N,,2025-12-04 04:57:54.403628

The president said the rollback would make cars more affordable while enabling consumer choice.
And now they’re going to be environmentally friendly but they’re gonna cost you a lot less,” said President Donald Trump.
The revised standards will save Americans an average of $1,000 on new cars and $109 billion in total over the next five years, according to the White House.","(The Center Square) – The federal government is relaxing Biden-era fuel economy standards that required most cars to have a fuel efficiency of nearly 50 mpg by 2031 in an effort to ease regulations for car manufacturers and make cars more affordable.

While the new Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards weren’t revealed in a White House announcement Wednesday afternoon, the presidents of Ford and Stellantis said they were more “aligned with customer demand” and would lead to more affordable vehicles for Americans.

“This CAFE standard that is aligned with customer demand is the right move for a lot of reasons,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said. “This allows us to invest in affordable vehicles made in the U.S., which we will take the lead on, and will allow us to make vehicles more affordable.”

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said that the revised regulations were “reconciled with real customers’ demand” and that the company is planning to increase production by 50%, creating 5,000 jobs.

The president said the rollback would make cars more affordable while enabling consumer choice.

“People were paying too much for a car that didn’t work as well. And now they’re going to be environmentally friendly but they’re gonna cost you a lot less,” said President Donald Trump.

To illustrate his point, Trump shared an anecdote about Ford having to make “numerous electric cars” to “sell one Ford 150″ based on previous policies accelerating the transition to electric vehicles.

“They were willing to lose money on building two or three electric cars that they couldn’t sell in order to make some money on the 150 because the 150 is a monster,” Trump said, with Farley nodding in the background.

The revised standards will save Americans an average of $1,000 on new cars and $109 billion in total over the next five years, according to the White House.

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the changes would enable more Americans to buy cars and boost automobile manufacturing in the U.S.

“These rules are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and [Pete] Buttigieg wants them to build, which is important, but also this is important for American jobs,” Duffy said. “So this is jobs, this is freedom, and this is common sense.”

Women-led initiatives promoting green energy transition in Africa Here are the top 10 women-based programs and ventures that are expanding the use of clean energy in Africa.
Addressing these gaps is important in sustaining the impact of their ventures and achieving a clean energy transition in Africa.","In 2024, only 25% of Africa’s electricity came from renewable energy sources, far below the global average of 41%. As the transition to green energy stumbles, the role of Africa’s women in driving it forward is becoming increasingly important. Their role as decision-makers, entrepreneurs, and community leaders can encourage the widespread adoption of renewable technologies across the continent.

Exploring this opportunity, various donor organizations are supporting women-centered programs and ventures that are investing in renewable energy. The programs mainly focus on establishing business incubators for women, leadership opportunities, skill enhancement, grants, and access to renewable energy entrepreneurship. In this DevelopmentAid article, we investigate several Africa’s women-led clean energy initiatives, and define their role in propelling the continent’s energy transition.

How do women advance green energy transition in Africa?

The women-led initiatives and ventures are inspiring Africa’s energy transition by promoting innovation and access to clean energy for poorer households.

✔️ Expanding access to energy: Since 89% of women in sub-Saharan Africa are the primary or co-decision-makers for household purchases, they influence the use of clean energy products such as clean cookstoves and solar products. They also prefer renewable energy for household products as it reduces the time and effort of chores like cooking and water collection. By replacing fossil cooking fuels with renewable alternatives in daily household activities, the initiatives therefore expand access to clean energy and promote a sustainable environment.

✔️ Ensuring low-income households have access to clean energy technology. Women are the best sales agents of clean cooking stoves with a study undertaken in Kenya finding that women entrepreneurs achieved more sales than men This is mainly due to the innovative ways they use to approach low-income households in remote areas. By employing women as sales agents, green energy transition activities can address energy poverty and promote economic independence among the vulnerable.

✔️ Diversifying innovation: The transition to renewable energy requires innovative solutions and a diverse talent pool. The female workforce brings a different concept to the traditional male-dominated energy sector, and is increasing creativity, innovation, effective decision-making, and profits. Energy initiatives are employing more women due to their problem-solving abilities and community-driven ideas, which encourage inclusive energy solutions to communities.

Women-led initiatives promoting green energy transition in Africa

Here are the top 10 women-based programs and ventures that are expanding the use of clean energy in Africa.

1️⃣ M-Kyala Ventures (East Africa). This project has developed an ecosystem that integrates women in all categories of the entrepreneurial network. It has driven transitions in sectors like reforestation programs, grants provision, technical support, and financial inclusion. As of 2025, the project has helped at least 500 women and girls and mobilized more than US$1 million capital for women-led enterprises.

2️⃣ Clean Technology Hub Program (Nigeria). This program provides seed funding and capacity-building to women-focused climate innovations. It initiated the She Sustains Accelerator program in 2024, where women gained access to a pool of investors and more than US$10,000 of equity-free funding. It has also supported at least 60 women-led start-ups that are working on clean energy solutions through research, development, and incubation.

3️⃣ Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. This initiative focuses on increasing gender-responsive economic growth. Its initial budget of CA$150 million in subsidized capital and CA$5 million in advisory financing aims to expand renewable energy access in Africa. The advisory funding supports gender inclusion in clean energy value chains. The beneficiaries receive financing to reduce the job and asset gaps between men and women in the sub-Saharan energy sector.

4️⃣ Solar Sister. Located in Rwanda, Uganda, and South Sudan, this initiative supports local women to develop clean energy enterprises. Women are trained to sell solar lanterns, household systems, and clean cookstoves in underserved areas without electricity. Since its inception in 2009 to 2023, Solar Sister has developed micro-enterprises for 171 women entrepreneurs, indirectly benefiting over 31,000 Africans with solar power.

5️⃣ Women in Energy Network Africa (WEN-Africa).

It also equips youths, women, and underprivileged students with employability skills to expand Nigeria’s renewable energy workforce. The initiative has trained at least 4,000 solar technicians and entrepreneurs, supported over 750 solar projects, and created over 6,500 clean energy jobs.

9️⃣ WindEnergy Africa (Zambia). This women’s initiative is committed to the last-mile distribution of sustainable and clean energy for cooking and lighting. The company has connected over 8,500 off-grid households, impacting 60,000 lives through its pay-as-you-go solar systems. It has also maintained a workforce where 60% of the employees and over 39% of its 600 + community ambassadors are women.

🔟 Green Girls Organization (Pan-African). This social enterprise uses AI to identify the clean energy challenges that women and girls encounter in rural areas. The participants are trained to develop biodigesters, create eco-briquettes from waste, and install solar panels. Through this initiative, the women and girls who have been trained save a minimum of US$200 in their initial business year, enabling them to expand their business and accrue income.

Wrap up

African women are actively participating in and leading the clean energy transition through their ventures and initiatives. The women-led ventures are boosting the energy transition and community resilience through training, and financing, and by providing leadership opportunities. However, they are facing challenges such as limited venture capital, weak policy support, and structural problems, which are hindering their long-term efficiency. Addressing these gaps is important in sustaining the impact of their ventures and achieving a clean energy transition in Africa.",https://www.developmentaid.org/api/frontend/cms/file/2025/12/Exploring-women-focused-green-energy-initiatives-in-Africa.webp,N,,2025-12-04 01:59:53.970230

Toyota has not yet disclosed when plug-in hybrid battery production might begin at the North Carolina plant, a decision that could influence future pricing and production scale.","Toyota is making one of the most significant manufacturing bets in its history as it doubles down on hybrids while much of the U.S. auto industry grapples with weakening demand for electric vehicles (EVs). The Japanese automaker has launched a sweeping expansion of its North Carolina operations, anchored by a $14 billion battery plant that represents the company’s largest investment in U.S. battery production to date.

For years, Toyota charted a cautious path while competitors raced toward full electrification. Companies like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen swiftly ramped up EV development and refitted factories, projecting a future where combustion engines would fade from showrooms entirely. Toyota, meanwhile, continued to prioritize hybrids—a strategy that had sparked criticism as the industry shifted its narrative toward all-electric mobility. But with tax credits expiring, EV prices remaining high and consumer adoption slowing, Toyota’s conservative approach now appears increasingly aligned with market realities.

Hybrids Gain Traction as U.S. EV Growth Plateaus

The EV boom that many automakers expected has slowed, challenged by consumer concerns over charging access, long-term maintenance and the rising cost of electric models. The decline in federal tax incentives has also removed an important financial sweetener that once helped offset high purchase prices.

Amid this cooling enthusiasm, Toyota is betting that hybrids—which can deliver as much as 50% better fuel economy than standard gasoline models—will attract the many U.S. buyers hesitant to commit to fully electric vehicles. The numbers support that trend: hybrids and EVs together now account for nearly half of Toyota’s U.S. sales, twice the share seen across the broader auto market.

The company’s lineup reflects this shift as well. Popular models including the Camry sedan and Sienna minivan are now sold exclusively as hybrids, reinforcing Toyota’s image as a hybrid-first automaker. Industry observers say the company’s long-term investment in hybrid technology has positioned it to lead at a time when consumer preferences are turning back toward vehicles that blend electric efficiency with gas-powered range.

A Major Manufacturing Expansion in North Carolina

Toyota’s battery plant in North Carolina—located between Greensboro and Raleigh—stands at the center of its hybrid-focused strategy. The facility, backed by $14 billion in funding, is the automaker’s first battery-production site outside Japan. It is also the single largest investment Toyota has made in a U.S.-based battery operation.

The company expects the plant to eventually supply batteries for up to 600,000 hybrid vehicles per year, while also building capacity for 74,000 plug-in hybrids and 45,000 fully electric vehicles. Early production is already being shipped to Toyota’s assembly plants in Kentucky and Alabama for use in hybrid models.

The automaker has committed another $10 billion over the next five years to expanding U.S. manufacturing, signaling a long-term commitment to domestic production. Executives say the plant’s North Carolina location helps reduce logistical and shipping costs, while also lowering exposure to tariff risks—an increasingly important factor as global trade policies shift.

The facility’s advanced production lines are built to handle a wide range of battery formats, giving Toyota the flexibility to achieve shifts in product strategy depending on regulatory developments and consumer trends.

Competitors Turn Back Toward Hybrids

Toyota’s renewed emphasis on hybrids comes as several rivals reassess their own EV-focused strategies. Volkswagen, for instance, had long considered hybrid development a temporary diversion on the road to full electrification. But faced with dealer feedback and slower-than-expected U.S. EV sales, the company is now developing hybrid versions of its best-selling models, including the Tiguan and Atlas.

Other automakers are taking similar steps as they confront steep financial losses in their EV divisions and slower consumer adoption than initially anticipated. The evolving competitive environment, however, presents a challenge for Toyota. As more companies pivot back toward hybrids, the category becomes more crowded, forcing Toyota to compete more aggressively to maintain its leadership in fuel-efficient vehicles.

Measured EV Approach Continues

Although Toyota has maintained a cautious stance on EVs, the company has not abandoned electric development entirely. It previously offered electric versions of the RAV4 in the late 1990s and now sells its low-volume bZ-branded EVs. A three-row electric SUV for the U.S. market is also in development, with batteries sourced from the new North Carolina plant.

Still, Toyota’s executives argue that affordability, charging limitations and material constraints remain significant barriers to widespread EV adoption. They point to the energy-intensive materials—such as lithium and rare-earth metals—used in EV batteries as a factor that complicates both production and environmental impact assessments.

For now, the company sees hybrids as a more practical and scalable path to reducing emissions while maintaining affordability for a broad range of customers.

RAV4 to Become All-Hybrid as Plug-In Output Rises

One of Toyota’s most notable product shifts will take place next year, when the RAV4—its top-selling U.S. vehicle—transitions to an all-hybrid lineup. The automaker also plans to greatly increase the number of RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid models it sells, with plug-ins expected to account for roughly 20% of total RAV4 production.

The RAV4 Prime is currently imported from Japan and subject to a 15% U.S. tariff, a factor that affects pricing and availability. Toyota has not yet disclosed when plug-in hybrid battery production might begin at the North Carolina plant, a decision that could influence future pricing and production scale.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/images-2025-12-03T225312.574.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 12:01:35.842874

At the same time, baseload generation from nuclear power complements renewable resources, helping to balance their intermittent generation and improving grid utilization.
“These findings reveal a powerful opportunity for Asia,” said Deepali Khanna, Senior Vice President and Head of Asia at The Rockefeller Foundation.
“Nuclear power offers a clean, reliable, and affordable pathway to meeting energy demands while creating jobs and advancing sustainability.","New data from Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Philippines, Rwanda, and South Africa show that nuclear — including next-generation SMRs — could deliver up to 20% of electricity generation and lower system costs by up to 31% by 2050 compared to renewables-only pathways.

Analysis identifies a clear catalytic role for philanthropy in accelerating early-stage adoption of nuclear solutions by supporting setting safety standards, de-risking, civil society engagement, and international cooperation.

NEW YORK | December 4, 2025 — The Rockefeller Foundation today released a new report that examines how next generation nuclear technologies could help emerging economies meet rapidly rising electricity demand and provide communities with clean, reliable, and affordable power. The Role of Nuclear Energy in Powering Universal Energy Abundance for Emerging Economies, takes an evidence-based approach to exploring nuclear deployment across Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Philippines, Rwanda, and South Africa, which are home to more than 2 billion people and among the fastest-growing energy markets in the world.

The report’s findings suggest that under the right policy and regulatory conditions, nuclear power — including small modular reactors (SMRs) — could play a more meaningful role in these countries’ energy futures than previously assumed, including delivering up to 20% of electricity generation and lowering system costs by up to 31% by 2050, compared to renewables-only pathways.

“The Rockefeller Foundation is committed to building a future of universal energy abundance where everyone has access to resilient, reliable, and affordable electricity,” said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. “As global energy demand grows, it’s never been more urgent to explore new technological pathways for emerging economies to access power and unlock opportunity for their people. This report demonstrates how nuclear energy can play a critical role in meeting that need with clean, continuous power.”

Exploring Nuclear Energy to Scale Clean Power and Energy Abundance

As the role of nuclear in the energy transition has diminished in many national strategies over recent decades, rising energy demand and growing energy security concerns have also led to renewed global interest in nuclear energy as a reliable, non-emitting source of baseload power. At the same time, baseload generation from nuclear power complements renewable resources, helping to balance their intermittent generation and improving grid utilization.

Conducted by Bayesian Energy with support from The Rockefeller Foundation, this new study combines detailed systems modelling with structured qualitative research and expert interviews to assess the potential for nuclear deployment across Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Philippines, Rwanda, and South Africa. Bayesian, using their proprietary power-system modelling platform Convexity, simulated power system evolution from 2025 to 2050 under multiple scenarios with and without nuclear deployment. Combined with additional qualitative analysis, key findings include, but are not limited to:

Demonstrating that renewables and nuclear are complementary technologies rather than rivals and that developing both lessens the need to overbuild solar and storage to reach a zero-carbon system.

Identifying key financial, institutional, and social barriers, as well as enabling factors such as governance capacity, policy design, and coordination mechanisms.

Adding new, country-specific evidence to help policymakers and partners assess where advanced nuclear solutions could fit within broader strategies for expanding clean, reliable power in EMDEs to meet countries’ industrialization and economic growth objectives and to help people flourish.

Providing an integrated understanding of the technical feasibility and practical readiness for nuclear deployment across EMDEs.

Reinforcing the catalytic role that philanthropy could play — despite its historical absence from this sector — in enabling early adoption, including supporting regulatory readiness, strengthening public engagement, facilitating access to international expertise, and helping governments de-risk investment decisions.

Modeling how nuclear power could supply up to 20% of total power by 2050 in several markets while reducing overall system costs by as much as 31% when paired with ambitious renewable energy expansion.

“Our modelling shows that nuclear can work with renewables and storage, not against them. Pathways with nuclear still rely on major renewable buildouts, but require far less storage and transmission,” said Aman Majid, co-founder of Bayesian Energy. “That means billions of dollars in avoided costs for countries where every dollar counts — along with less land use, fewer transmission lines, and fewer permitting challenges. But those benefits only materialize if nuclear projects can be built on time and on

budget and that’s where the hard work begins.”

The Rockefeller Foundation also convened 19 experts from philanthropy, governments, civil society, and industry to discuss the implications of these findings and potential pathways to scale philanthropic support for nuclear energy in emerging markets and developing economies.

Regional Support:

The eight markets analyzed in the study are among the most promising in Africa, Asia, and Latin America for initiating nuclear deployment by 2030, based on their projected energy demand growth, industrialization trajectories, and existing policy interest in low-carbon technologies.

“These findings reveal a powerful opportunity for Asia,” said Deepali Khanna, Senior Vice President and Head of Asia at The Rockefeller Foundation. “Nuclear power offers a clean, reliable, and affordable pathway to meeting energy demands while creating jobs and advancing sustainability. Philanthropy can help unlock this potential by supporting responsible expansion of nuclear power generation through strengthening public engagement, advancing regulatory readiness, and de-risking early investments.” “Nearly 700 million people today lack access to reliable power, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The modelling in this report shows how next-generation nuclear energy could expand energy access on the continent, which is critical for advancing long-term development and improving lives,” said William Asiko, Vice President for Africa at The Rockefeller Foundation. “What’s more, nuclear supports higher-paid, longer-lasting jobs than many other clean energy technologies, making it an opportunity to drive economic growth and expand opportunity for people across Africa.”

“This report offers valuable insights for strengthening energy security and resilience in emerging economies, highlighting solutions that can be scaled to Latin America and the Caribbean,” said Lyana Latorre, Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean at The Rockefeller Foundation. “At this time of growing energy demand and climate instability, it is important that we consider every opportunity to ensure reliable, affordable power in Brazil and across the Americas, to unlock economic opportunity and advance well-being for all.”

This report comes just weeks after COP30 in Belém, Brazil, where nuclear energy featured prominently in global climate discussions. A new COP30 “stock-take” from the Clean Air Task Force highlights that the sector’s challenge has shifted from political ambition to the practical ability to finance, regulate, and deploy advanced reactors at speed. Also at COP30, the World Nuclear Association announced the expansion of a global coalition committed to tripling nuclear capacity by 2050, while the IAEA underscored how nuclear science, technology, and energy systems are now firmly embedded in the official climate agenda.

In a question to Beta founder and CEO Kyle Clark during a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing on Wednesday, Representative Hillary Scholten (D-Mich.) mentioned that both Michigan and Ohio are working with the company to participate in the FAA's eVTOL Integration Pilot Program (eIPP).

The three-year initiative-created by a June executive order-will comprise at least five projects and study a range of applications, from passenger transport to medical delivery. State, local, tribal, and territorial governments have until December 11 to submit eIPP applications with a private partner. The program is a follow-on to the FAA's BEYOND, which helped shape the regulations around commercial drone operations.

Later in Wednesday's hearing, Representative Addison McDowell (R-N.C.) said that Beta is also seeking an eIPP partnership with the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT).

A Beta spokesperson confirmed the NCDOT partnership and said the company's eIPP operations will focus on cargo and medical delivery. Those commercial operations will begin before it flies passengers-a strategy Clark called a ""stepwise approach.""

""When most people think about urban air mobility, they think about jumping over traffic initially,"" Clark said. ""This is not Beta’s initial mission.""

Proving Ground

Beta is developing both eVTOL and eCTOL variants of its flagship Alia and has hinted at a larger, 19-passenger version in the future. It is also exploring autonomy, as well as hybrid-electric powertrains in partnership with GE Aerospace. The eIPP, Clark said, ""will be the unlock"" for these technologies and their integration into the national airspace.

""It will advance our industry by a year,"" he said. ""When I’m talking about our industry, I’m talking about all of these technologies that allow us to have safer and more reliable aerospace.""

Clark estimated that in the U.S. alone, there are about 4,300 ""applicable airports"" that could accommodate Beta's planned cargo, medical, and passenger services. He described a hub-and-spoke model-in which Alia aircraft move blood, patients, and other equipment to satellite hospitals to spread out resources-as ""one of the many missions that we’re pursuing.""

Other use cases could include critical deliveries of organs and low-shelf life medications.

""We're delivering cargo, medical, and logistics to rural communities,"" Clark said. ""So you have a meaningful impact, you expose the technology, you generate the data, and we get ahead of the rest of the world.""

Clark emphasized the need to keep the eIPP on track, anticipating initial operations as soon as the summer. He lamented China's dominance of the commercial drone industry and said the FAA must remain focused to avoid a similar outcome for electric aircraft.

""We’re asking for the goalpost to stay steady, for people to show up and be accountable, and for the FAA to meet their compulsory timelines that we believe should be in place for responses to things when we produce statistically relevant datasets,"" Clark said.

Welcome, Electric Aircraft

Michigan, Ohio, and North Carolina have each demonstrated interest in leading the way in electric and other advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft. All three have representatives in the National Association of State Aviation Officials' AAM Multistate Collaborative, a recently launched effort to harmonize regulations across state lines.

Michigan, in particular, has been a trailblazer. The state's AAM Activation Fund has poured more than $10 million into a variety of projects, including the installation of Beta's electric aircraft chargers at airports statewide.

North Carolina has a history of leading the way in commercial drone operations, serving as one of the FAA's initial proving grounds during BEYOND. Earlier this year, Walmart, DoorDash, and drone delivery partner Wing launched in Charlotte, cementing it as an early hub.

Ohio too has shown a penchant for new aviation technology, hosting the revived Pulitzer Trophy air races-the first to feature electric aircraft-in October. Beta conducted Alia flight demonstrations at Ohio State University's airport in August.

However, the eIPP will likely involve other states.

Archer Aviation is working with United Airlines to pursue a partnership. Founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in November that he is ""hopeful"" the company's recently acquired property-Hawthorne Municipal Airport (KHHR) in California-will be picked as an eIPP site. Virginia-based Future Flight Global, which has an order for up to 116 Archer Midnight air taxis, told FLYING in June it is discussing participation with multiple states.

Also in discussion with multiple states is Joby Aviation, which said in September it is working with partners in Texas, Florida, Ohio, New York, and California to demonstrate passenger and cargo transport.

Great British Energy publishes its first Strategic Plan

Great British Energy (GBE) today sets out a clear, practical plan to accelerate the UK’s shift to renewable power and strengthen the nation’s industrial backbone.

Today’s publication outlines GBE’s priorities for the next five years and shows how a publicly owned energy company can drive investment, support workers, and ensure communities feel the benefits of the energy transition.

From GBE spend between now and 2030, Great British Energy will deliver:

At least 15 GW of clean energy generation and storage assets – enough to power the equivalent of almost 10 million homes

£15 billion of mobilised private finance over time, driven by GBE’s investments and long-term partnerships

Support to over 1,000 local and community energy projects, expanding public participation and local control in the energy system

More than 10,000 jobs, directly supported through GBE-backed and funded projects, including in areas historically dependent on oil & gas

An income-generating portfolio, with income reinvested into more capacity and more opportunity

GBE will operate as a developer and equity investor, giving the public a lasting stake in the full lifecycle of clean energy infrastructure. The returns generated from publicly owned assets will be reinvested into new capacity, new jobs and new opportunities across the UK.

To support the delivery of its mission, GBE has set out three priority areas for investment:

GBE Local – ensuring that communities, and public services directly benefit from the clean energy infrastructure in their area

Onshore Energy – unlocking the energy potential of our land and strengthening grid stability across the country

Offshore Energy – accelerating the UK’s leadership in deep-water offshore wind and driving long-term growth in the sector

The Plan also provides further detail on the £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme, a major initiative designed to strengthen the UK’s industrial base and help deliver the UK’s Industrial Strategy. The programme will help build a resilient, long-term supply chain for clean energy and support high-quality jobs across the country. It will be formally launched later this month.

Great British Energy’s CEO, Dan McGrail, said:

“We are proud to be putting public ownership to work, unlocking investment, powering communities, creating jobs, and building an energy system that delivers for the UK.

“This Strategic Plan marks a major milestone in our mission to accelerate clean energy and the industries that support it.”

Great British Energy’s Chair, Juergen Maier, said:

“This plan puts the UK public at the heart of our energy future. By investing in clean power, supporting local projects, and unlocking British industry, Great British Energy will help deliver an energy system that works for everyone.”

Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, said:

“We set up Great British Energy to be a national champion that allows us to reap the benefits of Britain’s natural resources.

“This plan shows what a publicly-owned energy company will deliver: an abundance of clean, homegrown energy for British people and thousands of good jobs across the country.”

Background

Great British Energy was established by the UK Government to accelerate the country’s transition to clean, home-grown energy. By investing directly in renewable generation, local supply chains and innovation, GBE aims to create good jobs, lower bills, and secure Britain’s energy independence.

The full Strategic Plan will be available on the Great British Energy website from Thursday 4 December.

The Plan is a response to the Energy Secretary’s Statement of Strategic Priorities which was published earlier this year.

Great British Energy will build a portfolio that generates some returns by 2030 and sets the foundations for portfolio-wide profitability in the longer term.

The plan has been developed in collaboration with industry and community partners, including through detailed market engagement workshops held in Edinburgh, London, Belfast and Cardiff.",https://www.gbe.gov.uk/sites/default/files/GBE_avitar_colour.png,N,,2025-12-04 02:00:01.491003

A 2016 Colorado Energy Office study of coal mine methane identified 11 abandoned coal mines around Somerset that were spewing 4.3 million cubic feet of methane into the atmosphere a year.
The Paonia methane burning project could sell coal-bed methane destruction credits on the California market, but only for about $15 a ton.
“And it does not justify doing another project,” Caskey said.
In July, U.S. senators from Virginia and West Virginia re-introduced legislation that would create a tax credit for capturing methane at active and abandoned coal mines, which are the country’s fifth-largest source of methane emissions.","PAONIA — Taut tarps stretch across the meadow. An R2D2-sized valve sticks out of the ground. A long pipe runs down a slope, connecting the valve to a humming, red-hot tube.

“It’s satisfyingly analogue. Pipe and flame,” said Auden Schendler, a climate activist who walks the talk with his co-ownership of a methane-destruction project atop a dormant coal mine above Paonia. “There are a lot of people working on micro climate solutions right now. This is a macro solution and it’s a model for the rest of the world.”

Methane destruction is not terribly complicated. The owners of the 117-acre Bowie No. 1 coal mine — former Aspen Skiing Co. execs Schendler and Matt Jones and methane-hunting scientist Chris Caskey — are hoping their pioneering project on a grassy slope a half-mile from downtown Paonia can prove that.

They drilled a couple small holes into the coal mine below in December 2024 after securing state permits. They pumped 20,000 pounds of dense foam to seal two of the mine’s arched-roof portals. The Bowie No. 1 mine stretches for 900 acres underground. It has not operated since 1998.

The tarps installed in December 2023, shortly after they bought the property, were the first way to capture the methane leaking from the portals. The foam and small bores concentrate the methane and funnel it toward the valve. Down the slope from that valve, a horizontal pipe pushes the climate-savaging gas through a flame.

It’s 1,400 degrees at that flame, but as the gas burns and moves down the pipe, it’s less than 200 degrees. And that torched methane turns to carbon dioxide.

Methane is a greenhouse gas that can be 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere over the next 20 years. Humans have more than doubled the amount of methane in the atmosphere in the last 200 years.

At Bowie No. 1, the climate team in October destroyed more than 51 metric tons of methane. That’s the equivalent of removing more than 1,428 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. That’s according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s calculations showing the climate-warming effect of methane over 100 years. Caskey and Schendler prefer to use more urgent calculations that show the impacts of methane over 20 years, before its planet-warming density is reduced over many decades in the atmosphere.

“Because we don’t have 100 years to solve this problem. We have 20, 30 years,” says Caskey, who equates 51 metric tons of methane over his hastened timeline to 4,243 metric tons of carbon monoxide.

A gasoline-powered vehicle emits 4.29 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, or 0.36 metric tons a month. So removing 1,428 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the month is the equivalent of removing about 4,000 cars from the roads that month. Or by his more hastened calculations around the effects of potent methane over 20 years, the project has removed more than 11,700 cars from the road for the month of October.

Whatever way you count, he says, “As long as we keep it up, those cars stay off the road.”

Aspen Skiing Co. in 2012 invested $5.4 million to capture leaky methane at Oxbow Corp.’s Elk Creek coal mine in Somerset. Generators atop the mine converted the methane waste into 24 million kilowatt hours of electricity, enough to power the ski company’s four ski areas, 13 restaurants and three hotels. It also removed the annual equivalent of climate-impacting emissions belched by more than 13,000 cars.

The ski company’s boss at the time, Mike Kaplan, called the first-in-the-West project “the most exciting, innovative, optimistic, coolest project I’ve ever been associated with.”

Ten years later, the flow of the methane from the Elk Creek Mine slowed to a trickle and the generators stopped producing electricity. Today, the idled methane electricity project at the Elk Creek Mine only flares the methane, converting it to less impactful carbon dioxide.

That’s what the methane-destroying pipe at the abandoned Bowie No. 1 mine is doing. The damp gas burping up from the mine also generates water as it hits cold weather and is burned off. The project, at peak operation, could generate a few hundreds gallons of water a day.

Burning methane is the low-hanging fruit for climate advocates like Caskey, Jones and Schendler.

Reducing heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere requires sweeping economic and social transformation, they say. While climate advocates orchestrate those foundational shifts, it’s best to focus on the easiest steps for more immediate benefits.

A growing chorus of scientists argue that curbing methane emissions — as well as refrigerants, black soot and smog — right now can slow global warming by a half-degree Celcius, which would prevent more than 225,000 premature deaths and protect some 24 millions of tons of crops. And it’s not too heavy of a lift: plug leaky mines and pipelines, burn natural gas when drilling wells and compost organic waste before sending it to landfills. (Routine burning of natural gas is prohibited in Colorado, but state regulators do allow flaring when natural gas developers and drillers can show that flaring will reduce impacts to public health, safety, welfare, the environment or wildlife resources.)

“The best thing a planet can do today for the climate is to take a Bic lighter and go around the planet and set every methane leak on fire. And then we can figure out how to use it beneficially,” Schendler said. “But right now it’s pouring out of old mines and out of cracks in the earth and out of old well heads and no one is doing anything about it.”

Those coal mines around Paonia and Somerset “are steaming piles of methane,” Schendler said. “Like cow patties.”

Methane entrepreneur baking bricks, selling credits to slow warming

Caskey has spent the better part of a decade seeking out ways to capture and use methane in the North Fork Valley. Several years ago the chemist and former professor at Colorado School of Mines hatched a plan to collect sediment from the silt-clogged Paonia Reservoir and shape it into bricks and tile that could be cooked in kilns fired with methane leaking from 20-plus mines in the valley.

The climate warrior entrepreneur has followed the collapse of coal mining in Colorado. Coal used to deliver more than half of the state’s electricity and now it provides less than a third. Nowhere is the coal crash felt more acutely than the North Fork Valley, where the economy is transitioning away from mining and toward increased reliance on agriculture, tourism and recreation.

A 2016 Colorado Energy Office study of coal mine methane identified 11 abandoned coal mines around Somerset that were spewing 4.3 million cubic feet of methane into the atmosphere a year.

In 2023, Caskey used methane-sniffing gizmos on airplanes to identify the leaking and long-shuttered mines in Coal Basin above the Crystal River Valley. The amount of methane Caskey found qualified the Coal Basin mines as “super-emitters.” The five old Coal Basin mines on the eastern flank of Huntsman Ridge produced nearly 60 millions tons of coal between 1956 and 1990. The methane burbling from the mines that span more than 5 square miles could be doing as much damage to the climate as all the houses, buildings and vehicles in Pitkin County.

Caskey and the Aspen Community Office for Resource Efficiency want to capture that Coal Basin methane and burn it, just like he’s doing in Paonia. The White River National Forest is reviewing the plan to install flaring vents at the remediated mine portals in Coal Basin.

Today, Caskey, Jones and Schendler are hoping to find a business, philanthropist or regional government who would buy methane-destroying credits to reduce their carbon emissions impact. Inside a small shack, a computer monitors the flow of methane, carefully tracking the amount captured and burned. Maybe they can connect a brick-banking kiln to the super-hot flaring pipe for the Montrose-based Delta Brick and Climate Co. that Caskey sold to his company manager earlier this year.

The state of California, the fifth largest economy in the world, in 2013 created a market-based cap-and-trade program that requires businesses to either reduce carbon emissions or buy carbon-reducing offsets from a regulated market.

The Paonia methane burning project could sell coal-bed methane destruction credits on the California market, but only for about $15 a ton.

That would barely cover the cost of capturing and flaring the methane.

“And it does not justify doing another project,” Caskey said.

The answer for Colorado methane hunters would be a cap-and-trade program similar to California’s. Or a national program. In July, U.S. senators from Virginia and West Virginia re-introduced legislation that would create a tax credit for capturing methane at active and abandoned coal mines, which are the country’s fifth-largest source of methane emissions. (Colorado has a cap-and-trade program that allows major polluters to buy carbon-offsetting credits if they have installed certain systems to reduce on-site emissions.)

“So we wait for prices to go up or move off the regulated market into the voluntary market, where a philanthropist, business or community will buy at a higher price with the argument being these are extremely high quality credits,” said Schendler, who pitches a buy-in of the methane destruction project as “a good story, with good PR” on top of the climate benefits.

“We are hoping we can find someone saying we want to support this project because it’s the right thing to do,” Caskey said. “And then we can do it again and again.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2879-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=85&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-04 02:00:14.938296

Next, the article details the legal considerations for produced water and how different states currently navigate ownership. Finally, this article will argue that a consistent, clear standard of ownership is critical to encourage innovation and for produced water to be a viable part of future water supply strategies in states facing water scarcity.

Background: What Is Produced Water and Why It Matters

Produced water is naturally occurring water that is trapped in subsurface rock formations and brought to the surface during oil and gas production. When oil and gas flow to the surface, produced water accompanies them. Each barrel of oil produced yields approximately four to five barrels of water, meaning that produced water is by far the largest byproduct of hydrocarbon production.

Historically, produced water has been treated as waste. It was not until the 1930s that operators began reinjecting some produced water into drilling sites to enhance oil production. Its use continued to evolve in the early 2000s as a means of hydraulic fracturing. Still, in 2003, an estimated 667 million metric tons were discharged to the ocean from offshore facilities around the world. Increasing scarcity of freshwater has since prompted consideration of produced water as a supplemental resource containing valuable minerals. Once strictly considered a waste, produced water is now increasingly recognized as an asset—not only for the owners’ bottom line but also for water resources.

Repurposing produced water into a coveted resource is not without its challenges. Chief among them is the wide variation in composition. Produced water’s composition depends on the surrounding geology, the oil and gas phases in the reservoir, and the chemicals added during production. For example, produced waters in California and Wyoming contain less saline than seawater whereas in North Dakota and Pennsylvania, produced waters can contain over 10 times more saline than seawater. This wide variation complicates treatment, but also makes produced water a gold mine. Produced water can contain valuable minerals, such as lithium, that turn waste into a revenue source for owners.

The unique composition of produced water in any given region or drilling site presents a unique challenge for water treatment. Because each batch of produced water has such a distinctive composition, each batch may require multiple treatment processes. Thus, treatment technologies exist but are not cost-competitive with saltwater disposal wells or reuse in hydraulic fracturing. Currently, only one to two percent of produced water is used outside the oil and gas field after treatment. Discovering how to effectively and efficiently repurpose produced water is necessary, just time-intensive and costly. As more people recognize its revenue potential, technologies are advancing. For instance, Lithium Harvest, a clean energy and mining company, now specializes in lithium extraction from produced water. The company advertises its patented technology to oil and gas producers as a “turnkey solution” that integrates seamlessly with existing operations.

The current regulatory framework for produced water further shapes if and how owners can make the most of the resource. Due to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, states east of the 98th meridian (such as Oklahoma, Texas, and Pennsylvania) reuse more produced water inside the oil and gas fields. In contrast, states that are west of the 98th meridian (such as Colorado, California, New Mexico, and Wyoming) can more easily reuse treated produced water outside of the oil and gas fields. State regulations often reflect the composition of the produced water in the region. For example, California and Wyoming frequently reuse treated produced water for agriculture mainly because of the “good” water composition. In contrast, New Mexico has not permitted produced water to be used outside of oil and gas production due to a lack of understanding about treating and reusing produced water.

Overall, even if produced water is now being viewed as a resource, its complex composition and patchwork of state and federal regulation create a fragmented and uncertain legal landscape for owners of produced water.

Who Owns Produced Water? Mineral Rights, Surface Rights, and the Split Estate Problem

While the technical and regulatory challenges surrounding produced water shape whether it can be reused as a resource, an equally important question remains: who actually owns it? The answer is complicated by the long-standing separation of mineral, surface, and water rights in much of the American West.

Mineral rights are separate from surface landowners’ rights in much of the American West. This separation is called a split estate and is formed when a landowner sells their mineral rights or sells the surface estate while retaining their mineral rights. The surface estate then has the right to use the land, build on it, or sell it as they wish. The mineral estate has ownership of the resources beneath the surface, which usually includes oil, natural gas, and coal, and sometimes metals and other valuable minerals. The mineral estate owner has the legal authority to extract those resources and, as the dominant estate, can legally access the surface for resource extraction, even if it disrupts surface uses.

Water rights are legally distinct from mineral or surface rights and are governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local laws and ordinances. In much of the American West, water rights are determined by “first in time, first in right,” or the prior appropriation doctrine, under which the first person to divert the water and put it to beneficial use has authority over future water over newer uses. Seventeen states use prior appropriation in some form to govern at least a portion of the water within the state, including: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

However, when produced water is brought to the surface as a byproduct of oil and natural gas production, its legal status is far less clear. Unlike surface water or groundwater governed by the prior appropriations doctrine, it is often uncertain whether the mineral estate retains ownership and control over the produced water from its development of fossil fuels, whether it belongs to the surface owner, or whether the state has ownership.

The answer to the question of the ownership of produced water was decided by the Texas Supreme Court on June 27, 2025, in Cactus Water Services, LLC v. COG Operating, LLC. In this case, COG Operating purchased mineral leases for about 37,000 acres in Reeves County, Texas. The lease gave COG the exclusive right to explore and exploit “oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons” but specified nothing about waste. Cactus Water Services obtained “produced water lease agreements” from surface owners that gave it “all right, title and interest in and to . . . water from oil and gas producing formations and flowback water produced from oil and gas operations.” The Texas Supreme Court held that unless the surface estate owner expressly reserves property rights for liquid-waste byproduct, the mineral estate owner has ownership and control over produced water. The holding provides current mineral estate owners in Texas with certainty about their control over produced water from oil and natural gas production and will likely encourage mineral estate owners to invest in possible uses for the liquid “waste.” There will also likely be an increased trend of including clauses expressly reserving ownership of produced water in leases or sales of mineral rights in future estate splits.

Unlike in Texas, where the ownership of produced water conundrum has now been settled, barring unexpected changes by the Texas legislature, the majority of western states do not have clear ownership standards. Figure 1 shows the current standard, or lack thereof, for ownership of produced water in western states.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-wetlands-1487180526.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 02:00:38.312973

A key point of debate: Whether the proposed contract protects ratepayers from subsidizing the energy-hungry facility’s power demand

As Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned state regulators that “time is of the essence” to land a proposed Saline Township data center that needs their approval to move forward, other Michiganders lined up Wednesday night to urge those same regulators to slow down.

“If their entire business case collapses under the timelines needed to holistically plan, engage with formal public scrutiny and factor in risks, then its entire business model does not work in Michigan,” said Bryan Smigielski, a Michigan organizer with the Sierra Club.

The starkly different messages highlighted the high stakes as the Michigan Public Service Commission — a three-person regulatory body whose members are Whitmer appointees — weighs DTE Energy’s proposal to provide Michigan’s first planned hyperscale data center with enough electricity to power a million homes.

Tensions mount as data centers eye ‘sleepy’ Michigan farm towns

DTE officials have requested commissioners’ swift approval of a proposed 19-year contract to power the planned Saline Township facility, which would be jointly operated by Oracle, OpenAI and Related Digital.

Commissioners could rule as soon as Friday on the request or opt to open a so-called contested case, a lengthy review process that involves discovery, cross-examinations and formal hearings before a decision.

DTE officials contend thorough public vetting is unnecessary because the contract will not raise customers’ rates. They have warned that without swift approval, developers may cancel the $7 billion project.

That argument got a boost Wednesday from Whitmer, who supports the project and wrote in a letter to the commission that, “if we do not act, it will cost us thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in our economy.”

Whitmer stopped short of expressing support for ex parte approval, but warned that other states are racing to land “similar projects with far less oversight.”

Business and trade union representatives also urged commissioners to approve the proposed contract.

A host of other parties, including Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, multiple environmental groups and dozens of lawmakers, have urged the MPSC to open a contested case, arguing a development that would add an unprecedented amount of new demand on Michigan’s electrical grid deserves thorough public vetting.

“Fast-tracking a project of this size while side-stepping the formal process is reckless and sets a horrible precedent,” said Sen. Sue Shink, D-Northfield Township, who was among nearly two dozen Democratic legislators to sign a joint letter Wednesday calling for a contested case.

Commissioners did not say Wednesday how they’ll vote on the proposed contract, but sought to assure onlookers that they’re taking the review seriously.

“My fellow commissioners and I are looking to ensure that the protections envisioned by the contract are strong enough to ensure that Michigan’s customers don’t foot the bill for any cost incurred by data centers,” Commissioner Katherine Peretick said.

Deliberation over the contract comes at a pivotal moment for Michigan, where tech companies are racing to secure land and energy access to build data centers that are newly eligible for tax exemptions worth millions of dollars annually for a single facility.

Developers have publicly floated no fewer than 12 data center proposals in recent months in the rural outskirts of places like Monroe, Milan, Lowell and Howell as they race against one another to occupy limited excess capacity on Michigan’s energy grid.

The flurry of activity has prompted furious debate, with proponents welcoming the potential for new tax revenue and business investment while opponents condemn developers’ secretive negotiating tactics and express concerns about the facilities’ environmental impacts.

Depending how they’re built, data centers can use vast quantities of water or relatively little.

But all hyperscale data centers demand copious amounts of energy (the Saline Township facility would gobble up as much as a million homes), and utilities have often kept up by burning more of the fossil fuels that are dangerously warming the planet.

Meeting the facilities’ power demand often requires major new investments in the energy grid, prompting concerns about who will pay for the poles, wires, batteries and power plants needed to serve the industry.

Michigan law requires data center developers to pick up those costs in order to receive tax breaks, and DTE officials contend their proposed contract is in compliance. But the only publicly available version of the document is heavily redacted.

“If somebody is trying to race through the process with closed doors … there’s probably a reason,” said Washtenaw County resident Rachel Brown, one of dozens of commenters who urged commissioners to conduct a deeper review.

Under the proposed 19-year contract with an Oracle subsidiary called Green Chili Ventures LLC, the 1.4-gigawatt facility would be required to pay for at least 80% of its contracted power even if it uses less and would be required to pay for at least 10 years of service even if it closes early. Data center developers would also cover the cost to build 1.4 gigawatts of battery storage to help power the facility.

Commissioners are tasked with approving the contracts if they find that they’re reasonable and in the public interest, said Mike Byrnes, the commission’s chief operating officer.

“It’s important to note that a utility can’t refuse to provide service to a customer who wants service and is willing to comply with approved terms and conditions of service, and the commission can’t direct the utility not to provide service to such a customer,” he said.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

'People want the gasoline car'

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats' efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,'' said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. ""We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

Climate change is one of the top threats to vulnerable species around the world, driving widespread losses of plants and animals that can’t adapt fast enough. But at the same time, rising temperatures are in some cases opening the door for certain organisms that can thrive under these changes: invasive species.

From melting sea ice to longer growing seasons, global warming is unlocking new pathways for the spread and proliferation of certain non-native plants, animals, fungi and bacteria, according to a growing body of research. These new arrivals can wreak havoc on ecosystems and agricultural land, sometimes outcompeting native species and costing the global economy more than $400 billion in damages annually—including $21 billion in the United States alone, estimates suggest.

Despite these threats, the Trump administration has poked holes in invasive species research funding and mitigation efforts across the country in recent months. Scientists say this decrease in resources could have major long-term ecological and economic consequences.

Unintended Hitchhikers

The rise of long-haul transportation and trade has made the world more connected than ever before. Unfortunately, the cars, trains, planes and boats that carry us, food and products can also pick up some unintended hitchhikers along the way in the form of seeds, insects, bacteria and even birds and mammals. Whether attaching to the bottom of a boat, stowing away in a cargo plane or even getting stuck on someone’s shoe, these species often incidentally travel from their ecosystem to new places where they can spread.

That’s exactly what happened with the spotted lanternfly, an insect from China that scientists believe made its way to the U.S. on a shipment of stone in 2012. Since then, the lanternflies have spread to at least 15 states across the Eastern U.S., reaching populations of up to 150,000 some years in Pennsylvania alone, The Guardian reports.

While these polka-dotted insects may look harmless, a 2019 study estimated that spotted lanternflies can cause $324 million in damages and cause the loss of 2,800 jobs by killing trees that are crucial for apple and wine production or support birds, bats and reptiles in the region. Similar destruction has followed as other invasive animal species spread across the world, from Burmese pythons in Florida to brown rats in New Zealand.

Many non-native species in the U.S. are plants, said Bethany Bradley, an invasive species expert at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The term “non-native” is used to describe organisms that do not naturally occur in an area and are introduced by human activities, but they are only classified as “invasive” if the species causes harm to the broader ecosystem, according to the National Park Service.

The reason that many invasive plants outcompete native ones is that they are fast-growing, produce numerous seeds and can better handle shifts in temperature or soil.

Once an invasive species is well-established, “basically, you end up with this introduced plant taking over an ecosystem,” Bradley said. She co-authored research published in 2023 that found certain common invasive plant species may be able to spread more rapidly under climate change in the Northeastern U.S. Though these states are currently unsuitable for certain invasive plant growth, rising temperatures could change that.

Some invasive plant species may be what’s known as a “sleeper,” which are “right on the edge of its tolerance, and so if it warms up a little bit more, maybe you transition from an established population to one that is actively invading,” Bradley said.

Silver lining: Her research also found that 62% of currently abundant invasive species will see a decrease in habitat for large populations in the Eastern U.S. under 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. That being said, close to a third of global species overall will be at risk of extinction if temperatures rise by even 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a 2024 study.

Climate-Fueled Invasion

Other climate impacts could also drive the spread of invasive species, such as longer growing seasons or new shipping routes opening up as sea ice melts, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. On the flip side, invasive species can also exacerbate climate impacts.

For example, the deadly wildfire that tore through Lahaina in 2023 was made worse by the highly flammable, fast-growing, nonnative grasses introduced by farmers decades ago. Invasive grasses frequently fuel fires in the Western U.S.—and are typically the first to grow back after the fire, as well.

The most critical and least expensive stage to tackle invasions is when there is a small number of the species in a particular area, according to Sara Kuebbing, a researcher at the Yale School of the Environment.

“You need someone to identify, ‘Oh no, there’s something that we think is about to take off [and] it’s ready to spread’—and that usually happens,” she told me. “What fails is the institutions and the will a lot of times to contain it at that point.”

She pointed back to the spotted lanternfly, which would have required several states to come together at the early detection phase and dedicate the resources necessary to study how best to tackle the invasion and shut it down. This did not happen, as evidenced by the many spotted lanternflies I saw fluttering through the forest on a recent trip to upstate New York.

But governments are working to better collaborate on invasive species issues. In the Midwest, the U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes Fishery Commission has been working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control invasive sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes, which span the Canadian border. A single one of these toothy, eel-like critters can eat 40 pounds of fish a year, so the commission targets the lamprey by spraying pesticide while they are still in the larval stage.

My colleague Anika Jane Beamer reported in February that the program was affected when the Trump administration laid off a large swath of USFWS employees, including several who worked with the commission, and enacted a travel ban and hiring freeze that delayed the remaining staff’s ability to carry out lamprey control measures.

She checked back in earlier today with Greg McClinchey, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. He said the team raised this issue with supportive members of Congress, got the changes reversed and have had no complications since then, but did lose about five weeks “before we got everything back on track.”

The team is not yet sure if the delay will result in more lamprey later this year.

“What we know for sure is we can’t have what happened in ’25 happen again in ’26,” McClinchey said.

Also in the Midwest, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum in May directing the administration to “expeditiously implement the most effective mechanisms, barriers and other measures” to keep invasive Asian carp out of the Great Lakes, a rare show of support for environmental projects by the administration. However, other invasive species projects have been hit hard by Trump administration actions.

Since 2012, the federally managed Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, hosted at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has worked to increase collaboration on invasive species management in the region. Bradley, who works in the center, helped create a regional network that has become a primary source for mapping invasive plant movement and sharing research on the subject across the region.

She said that states recently asked the center to develop a database of current and emerging invasive plants across the Northeast, but the project largely stalled after the Department of the Interior rejected a proposal for the university to continue hosting the center when it was up for a rebid in February. The Interior Department did not respond when I asked why the administration made this decision and if it will fund the invasive species work through a different mechanism.

Because of lapsed funding, graduate student researchers have been shifted to other projects or are focusing on teaching instead of research. Bradley isn’t sure when she’ll be able to prioritize the project again and is worried that she won’t have the resources to accept students in the future.

“It means that we’re just in this … zombie mode,” Bradley said. “Basically, we’re not dead, but we’re not alive, and it’s been a weird space. We’re still in this long waiting period of hoping that Congress’ support will ultimately be enough to convince the administration that this is a program that does good things.”

The three members of the Michigan Public Service Commission did not indicate in their remarks whether they will allow a contested case on DTE’s proposed electric contract. A contested case would enable parties representing businesses, environmental interests, ratepayers, and other groups to submit testimony on the electric contracts for the Saline Township data center.

State regulators are learning from data center issues in other states to “ensure that we protect residents on the issues of affordability, reliability, and resource adequacy,” said Commissioner Katherine Peretick. The commission is evaluating the contracts DTE submitted to ensure other Michigan customers do not pay for costs incurred by data centers, she said.

Several commenters told commissioners that meeting the data center’s electricity demand could increase their utility bills, decrease energy reliability, undermine Michigan’s climate law, and potentially leave ratepayers to pay for stranded costs if the data center uses less power than anticipated or ceases operation.

DTE Energy maintains that supplying power to the data center will not increase costs for other customers.

Representatives for unions and businesses spoke in favor of the data center, saying it would produce thousands of temporary construction jobs and bring significant tax revenue to local communities.

Commenter Ron Smith, with the grassroots group Macomb Defenders Rising, said the project could compound rising electricity costs for Michigan ratepayers, adding that the massive increase in energy demand may allow DTE to avoid compliance with Michigan’s 2023 clean energy law.

“This will give DTE a built-in loophole to delay the transition to clean energy, expand fossil fuel use, and build more gas infrastructure, all at the expense of Michigan families,” Smith said.

DTE pushes for approval of data center contracts by Friday

DTE is pushing state regulators to greenlight its contracts to supply power to the Saline Township data center at its Friday, Dec. 5 meeting, and said the project could be canceled if it isn’t approved by that date. The utility has said a contested case is unnecessary because the project will not increase the cost of service for other customers.

Saline resident Marilla Widerquist said the time pressure placed on the project by developer Related Digital is “clearly a scare tactic.”

“Those who are for ex parte approval represent business interests and not the average resident, which has been made clear by the comments tonight,” she said.

Commenter Eric Hartsfield urged the commission to allow a contested case, and expressed concern that DTE’s contracts may have inadequate protections for repercussions like stranded assets.

“This is the first of DTE’s steps toward taking care of data center customers. I just feel like it’s really important that we take the time to get it right,” he said.

Hartsfield called attention to Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s support for a contested case.

“The contracts remain public only under significant redactions and promises made by DTE to hold ratepayers harmless remain flimsy and unsupported in the public record,” Nessel said in a Nov. 18 statement.

By Wednesday afternoon, the case had over 4,800 comments on the MPSC’s webpage, many of them calling for a contested case or expressing opposition to the data center. In contrast, 363 comments have been submitted on the MPSC site for DTE’s pending $574 million electric rate hike request, which has also met with opposition.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer released a statement in support of DTE’s data center plan just minutes before Wednesday night’s meeting. She said the project would create 2,500 union construction jobs, 450 permanent, high-skill jobs on site, and 1,500 more jobs in the county.

Whitmer’s administration has vetted environmental protections for the project, and confirmed the facility’s power demands can be met with existing DTE generation, and upgrades for the project will maintain reliability without shifting costs to other ratepayers, the statement said.

“The reality is that data centers are going to be a big part of America’s future. The question isn’t whether they will be built, but rather: Can Michigan benefit from these jobs and build data centers in a smarter way while upholding our strong environmental laws to protect our precious natural resources?” Whitmer asked.

Cadillac resident Cody Gilbert expressed skepticism of the benefits of the project Wednesday night, and said artificial intelligence that’s powered by data centers is set to take millions of jobs.

“What good is additional tax revenue when we’re set with climate disasters in the future that are going to be taking lives across the globe and are already affecting our lives here in Michigan?”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dte-energy-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 02:00:24.119098

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,” said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

'People want the gasoline car'

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats' efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

About Marelli Marelli is a global mobility technology supplier to the automotive sector.","SAITAMA, Japan, Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Marelli, a global mobility technology supplier to the automotive sector, unveiled today its new solution for Intelligent Energy Management for hybrid and electric vehicles at CTI Europe 2025, in Berlin (Germany). The system is modular, and it's based on a proprietary software which can be integrated with vehicle and zonal control units and thermal components. This solution enables seamless coordination across the vehicle's three main energy domains: thermal, propulsion and electronics.

This holistic approach to vehicle energy optimization maximizes efficiency across all vehicle systems, delivering enhanced battery range, optimized fast charging and improved longevity, all while maintaining superior cabin comfort and operational reliability. Marelli's new Intelligent Energy Management system is aimed at advancing both hybrid and electric propulsion solutions, as well as Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) technologies.

The system was developed by integrating advanced digital twin methodologies and innovative software strategies. These approaches significantly reduce development time and costs, while also enabling a strong and flexible collaboration model with customers.

Regarding the thermal domain, the system manages and optimizes thermal flows, ensuring precise control of heating and cooling processes within the vehicle. Decoupled software algorithms intelligently manage complex thermal systems, regulating temperatures to optimize overall performance and extend battery life. These advanced strategies reduce energy losses and promote effective reuse of excess thermal energy, resulting in lower operational costs and increased sustainability.

For electric/hybrid propulsion, the Intelligent Energy Management System continuously monitors and adjusts power delivery to optimize energy distribution. This maximizes battery efficiency and vehicle performance. By effectively recovering energy and balancing its distribution, the system extends driving range and enhances overall resilience, supporting the needs of next-generation electric vehicles.

Regarding the electronics domain, the solution enhances the intelligence and integration of vehicle systems, by facilitating seamless communication between all components and systems. Data exchanges occur over robust communication protocols – from CAN to Ethernet – enabling direct management of sensors and actuators. This ensures smooth operation, higher system responsiveness and greater adaptability to evolving vehicle environments.

Development of a digital twin application allows for precise virtual modeling of every vehicle subsystem, including electronics, electromechanics, thermodynamics and hydraulics. By creating fully virtualized car models, automakers can iterate faster, test more efficiently and bring advanced vehicles to market sooner and more confidently.

The new Intelligent Energy Management technology leverages Marelli's software development capabilities, empowering agile customization and rapid deployment of solutions tailored to specific customer needs. By streamlining system architectures and minimizing component count, the company enables a simplified system at a competitive cost and faster time-to-market, while reducing development and testing costs.

Giovanni Mastrangelo, Head of R&D for Marelli's Propulsion business said: ""Intelligent energy management is the central challenge facing today's electric and hybrid vehicle development. At Marelli, we address this by delivering solutions that not only optimize energy flow across thermal, electric and propulsion domains, but also minimize losses and recover excess thermal energy. Through our digital twin and decoupled software approach, we empower our customers to reduce development timelines, gain flexibility, and accelerate adoption of cutting-edge technologies, driving the future of sustainable and efficient mobility.""

Marelli introduced the new technology at the CTI Symposium, held in Berlin on December 2 and 3. In the keynote speech ""Application of Digital Twin Approach to Thermal Management System Development for xEV"", Matteo De Cesare, R&D Innovation Manager of Marelli's Propulsion business, offered expert insight into innovative design and virtual development processes for thermal systems within the context of vehicle electrification, along with related achievements and performance KPIs.

""Today is a victory (for) common sense and affordability,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley chipped in.

Environmentalists quickly pushed back, saying the windback stood out even among Trump's many anti-green actions because of its outsized impact on car-dependent America.

""Trump is taking a wrecking ball to the biggest single step any nation has ever taken to combat oil use, global warming pollution, and helping save consumers money at the gas pump,"" Dan Becker, an activist with the Center for Biological Diversity, told AFP.

At stake are the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, created in 1975 in response to the Arab oil embargo, which require vehicles to achieve the ""maximum feasible"" mileage per gallon.

Under the proposed rule, the administration would roll back past and planned efficiency increases, targeting a fleetwide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031 -- ""no better than what American cars are getting today,"" said Becker, noting CAFE figures overstate real-world mileage by roughly 25 percent.

Trump's Department of Transport argues that Biden officials improperly factored in electric and hybrid vehicles, saying the standards would be unattainable for gasoline-powered cars and would effectively force a shift in the market.

Gina McCarthy, a former senior official under Biden and Barack Obama, countered the move would not only worsen climate change but harm the auto industry by slowing its shift to electric vehicles.

""The rest of the world will continue to innovate and create cleaner cars that people want to buy and drive, while we're forced to sit in our clunkers, paying more for gas, and pumping out more tailpipe emissions.""

Trump EV fight

Trump has railed against what he calls an EV ""mandate"" -- a stance that puts him at odds with his on-again, off-again billionaire ally Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO whose company still dominates the US EV market.

Republicans in Congress have repealed clean-energy tax credits in a major tax and spending bill, and targeted California's ability to set its own vehicle-emission limits.

Throughout 2025, GM and other US automakers have curtailed or pushed back new EV plant capacity.

But whether savings from reduced EV investment will filter through to consumers remains unclear.

While the shift away from EVs does allow automakers to delay or forego billions of dollars in new investments, some funds are being steered into new initiatives to add US carbuilding capacity in light of Trump's tariffs.

""Meeting high fuel economy standards has been challenging for the auto industry and has added to vehicle cost,"" Charlie Chesbrough, an analyst with Cox Automotive, told AFP.

""However, consumers like fuel-efficient vehicles. This year traditional hybrids are up double digits from last year while gas vehicles are basically flat,"" he added.

""Since most consumers don't have transportation alternatives available, people fear high gas prices. And good MPG is a way to mitigate that risk.""

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

'People want the gasoline car'

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats' efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,'' said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. ""We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards standards in question, set by the Transportation Department, set minimum miles per gallon that automakers’ fleets have to meet.

“We’re officially terminating Joe Biden’s ridiculously burdensome — horrible, actually — CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions and all sorts of problems,” Trump said at a White House event.

However, enforcement of the standards were recently gutted in the president’s Big Beautiful Bill: A provision pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) reduced the penalties for not meeting the standards down to $0, making them toothless.

Nevertheless, if the Trump proposal is finalized, the standard that automakers will be legally required to meet will be lower, even if they won’t face penalties for failure to comply.

Under the Biden-era standards, the nation’s vehicle fleet would have been expected to reach 50.4 miles per gallon by model year 2031. Now, the Trump administration expects the fleet to average 34.5 miles per gallon that year.

The U.S. mileage and auto pollution standards have had massive impacts on the nation’s emissions trajectory, and the recent moves to gut them are considered a major setback in the fight against climate change.

They were expected to require a significant market shift toward electric vehicles.

The proposal to axe them is also a significant piece of Trump’s deregulatory, affordability and jobs messages, as Trump repeatedly criticized the Biden-era standards while on the campaign trail.

“We’re bringing back the car industry that was stolen from us because we have people that didn’t know what they were doing sitting at this desk,” Trump said Wednesday, flanked by Republican lawmakers and representatives from Ford, Stellantis and GM.

In a written statement, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the change would have families an average of $1,000 on the cost of a new vehicle. The Biden administration had said that its rule for model years 2027 and beyond would save families $600 in fuel costs over the life of their vehicles.

The Biden administration also said that its standard, which the Trump administration is proposing to dismantle, would save almost 70 billion gallons of gasoline through 2050 and prevent more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

The Biden administration required automakers to improve their fleets’ efficiency by 8 percent for model years 2024 and 2025 and 10 percent for model year 2026. It required fleets in model years 2027 through 2031 to increase their efficiency by 2 percent each year.

Those standards were issued in conjunction with Environmental Protection Agency vehicle emissions standards that were considered particularly ambitious, but the Trump administration is also seeking to axe that regulation.

Now, the Trump administration is proposing to revert to model year 2022 standards, saying that automakers will have to increase at 0.5 percent per year from those standards through model year 2026. After that, they will have to increase 0.25 percent per year.

Trump’s moves received praise from many in the auto industry.

“We’re reviewing [the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s] announcement, but we’re glad the agency has proposed new fuel economy standards,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO at the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

“The current CAFE rules finalized under the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for EVs,” he said.

However, environmentalists and Democrats criticized the decision.

“The biggest single step any nation has ever taken to cut global warming pollution, gas consumption and save consumers money at the pump are the CAFE standards and the EPA standards, and that’s what Trump is gutting today,” Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s safe climate transport campaign, told The Hill.

“Let’s call it what it is: Donald is handing his Big Oil donors exactly what they want: weaker protections for consumers and bigger profits for polluters,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) in a written statement. “California will defend fuel economy standards that protect families’ budgets, our children’s lungs, and our future.”

The European Union has reached a deal to phase out Russian gas faster than originally planned, a move that aims to finally sever ties between the bloc and its once-primary energy supplier.

In the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, traders and energy companies have closely monitored the EU’s shift away from Russia toward alternative suppliers such as the US and the Middle East. But while Europe halved purchases after the war began in 2022, Russian gas has continued to account for roughly a fifth of imports.

Negotiators representing member states, the European Parliament and the European Commission cut that remaining link in the early hours of Wednesday, agreeing to gradually prohibit liquefied natural gas imports from Moscow by the end of 2026. That’s a year earlier than originally proposed by the Commission and in line with a ban on seaborne deliveries already approved by the EU under its latest sanctions package on Russia.

Gas Ties

Pipeline gas imports under long-term deals will have to halt by Sept. 30, 2027, with a possibility of an extension to Nov. 1, 2027, depending on fulfillment of gas storage targets set by the EU. That compares with an end-2027 ban on those contracts originally put forward by the commission.

“Finally, and for good, we are turning off the tap on Russian gas,” EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen said on X. “Europe has chosen energy security and independence. We will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation.”

The EU had proposed the measure in June to address risks to its energy security after the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent curbs on gas flows to the bloc.

The US has sought to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and speculation that a potential agreement could eventually ease sanctions on Russian energy has contributed to benchmark European gas futures recording their longest downward streak in almost four years.

But the EU has continued to push its plan, known as RePowerEU, to cut reliance on Moscow for good.

Going back to Russian supplies would be “a mistake” for the region, Fatih Birol, executive director for the International Energy Agency, told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. “Russia being the major energy supplier in Europe — that saga is gone, that chapter is closed.”

“This is a big win for us and for all of Europe,” said Lars Aagaard, energy minister for Denmark, which is holding the EU’s rotating presidency and was representing member states in the talks. “We have to put an end to the EU’s dependence on Russian gas, and banning it in the EU permanently is a major step in the right direction.”

The EU receives about 15% of its LNG supplies from Moscow, making Russia the second-largest provider of the fuel to Europe after the US. The monthly bill for those imports ranges between €500 million and €700 million.

The shift away from that trade comes at a time of plentiful supply. The global gas market is expected to start shifting into a surplus in the second half of next year, reducing the risk that an EU phaseout of Russian shipments would put pressure on supplies and drive up prices. That’s helped secure broad political support in the region for a comprehensive and lasting break with Russia.

Source: BloombergNEF Global LNG Market Outlook 2030, July 14, 2025

Europe has also been under pressure from the US to speed up moves to sever its energy ties with Moscow, and buy more American LNG. A trade deal between Europe and the US agreed earlier this year included a commitment to purchase $750 billion in US energy by 2028.

Under the deal on RePowerEU, the phaseout of Russian gas would start with a ban on new purchases from the beginning of next year, with exemptions for existing deals.

For LNG, short-term contracts concluded before June 17, 2025 will be prohibited as of April 25, 2026, the date on which EU sanctions on seaborne deliveries kick in. Pipeline gas brought into the region under short-term deals will be banned as of June 17, 2026.

To avoid circumvention, the measure introduces a prior authorization regime, the EU Council representing member states said in a statement.

For Russian gas and imports in the transition period, information required for authorization will have to be submitted at least one month before entry. For non-Russian gas, it will have to be provided at least five days before and seven days for volumes brought in via the Strandzha 1 interconnection point.

That requirement will not apply to major gas-producing countries that exported more than 5 billion cubic meters to the EU in 2024, and either have restrictions on Russian gas or no infrastructure to import.

To put an end to Russian oil imports, the measure obliges member states to prepare plans to diversify their supplies. The commission also plans to put forward a legislative proposal on phasing out Russian oil imports no later than the end of 2027.

The deal reached in the so-called trilogue format will need to be formally approved by member states and the European Parliament and published in the bloc’s bulletin to become a law.

The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has allowed a large part of the American population to get access to healthcare who didn’t have access before. Former President Obama’s initial draft of the healthcare bill was far superior to what actually passed. Insurance companies got involved and weakened the legislation. At least it was a start.

The Affordable Care Act was never meant to be the end-all solution. Its purpose was always the first step to eventual universal healthcare. In the U.S., we spend more than other nations on our healthcare and get subpar quality care compared to other industrialized countries.

We need universal healthcare now.

Bottom Line: A Predictable Offshore Future Helps Power American Energy The five-year offshore leasing plan is not just about drilling, it’s about direction.","For nearly three years, offshore energy producers, Gulf Coast workers and state leaders have urged Washington to restore clarity and predictability to U.S. offshore development. The Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM) five year offshore leasing plan is more than a procedural update; it is a path forward that can bring back predictability to one America’s most critical energy engines.

The five-year offshore oil and gas program, required under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), should have been in place since July 1, 2022 when the previous plan expired. However, it was more than a year later (September 29, 2023) before the Biden administration published its draft final 2024-2029 plan, which included the lowest number of auctions in the program’s history.

DOI announced a Secretary’s Order titled “Unleashing American Offshore Energy that terminates the 2023-2029 plan, and published the first draft of a revised 2026-2031 plan which includes 34 proposed sales across the Gulf of America and coasts of Alaska and California.

When offshore exploration projects stall, it creates a cascade effect, freezing multi-year investments, and halting thousands of jobs and economic benefits. As Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) President and CEO Edith Naegele underscored in a statement:

“A robust Five-Year Plan is essential to U.S. national security needs as it reduces our dependence on foreign oil, ensures a stable domestic energy supply, and supports hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs. Independent oil and natural gas producers commend the Trump Administration on its thoughtful first iteration of the national OCS oil and gas leasing program, commonly referred to as the Five-Year Plan. As designed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), Five-Year Plans have a vigorous multi-iteration development process with several steps for analysis and extensive public comment. IPAA strongly supports broad inclusion of all OCS areas to ensure areas of high interest make it into the final plan. This will ensure a competitive bidding process among producers which ensures a good return to the American people via billions of dollars paid annually to the U.S. Treasury.”

The Latest Plan – Expanding Offshore Energy Potential.

The draft OCS leasing program spans the years 2026-2031, and will include as many as 34 potential offshore lease sales. Notably, the proposed lease sales includes federal waters off the coasts of California and Florida, which haven’t seen new offshore oil and gas development in decades.

Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, lauded the DOI and BOEM’s move to expand the areas where lease sales are available. Milito told POLITICO:

“We need to make sure we’re not missing out on potential strategic opportunities 10, 15, 20 years down the road, because the production we have now is because of decisions we made 10, 15 years ago.”

The complete breakdown of proposed leases includes 21 areas off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Gulf of America, and six along the Pacific coast. Alaska’s lease sales are proposed to start in 2026, with the remaining sales in the Gulf and Pacific to commence in 2027. In addition to the leasing program, the DOI has confirmed it will hold four lease sales in the next twelve months: one in December 2025, two in March 2026, and one in August 2026.

This is especially exciting on the heels of recent BOEM analysis that estimated the Gulf of America has an additional 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent since the Bureau’s 2021 report, bringing the total reserve estimate over seven billion barrels of oil equivalent.

Offshore Oil Product Is a Cornerstone to US Energy Security

The Gulf of America produced roughly 1.8 million barrels per day of crude oil in 2024, nearly 15 percent of total U.S. crude output. Without consistent offshore leasing, those volumes inevitably decline, lowering America’s production capacity. That decline does not make global energy demand disappear; it simply shifts demand to other producing countries to fill the gap.

Recent years have been marked by global energy uncertainty. Supply disruptions from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions have strained markets and driven price volatility. In 2024, the International Energy Forum reported that while upstream investment has recovered since the pandemic, it remains below the level needed to meet demand through 2030, with about $740 billion per year required to ensure energy security. These challenges show what policymakers already know: energy security begins at home.

As Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum noted earlier this year:

“The Gulf of America is a powerhouse, and by streamlining permitting and expanding access, we’re not just powering our economy—we’re strengthening our national security and putting thousands of Americans back to work.”

Jobs, Revenues and Economic Benefits

The economic ripple effects of offshore activity extend far beyond the platforms themselves. Over the past two decades, offshore energy production in the Gulf of America has produced nearly $150 billion in total revenue for the United States, coastal states, and their parishes and counties.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. offshore sector supported 270,000 jobs in 2024 and average around 354,000 jobs each year through 2040. Most of these jobs are across the gulf states of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama, creating thousands of local jobs for welders, engineers, crane operators and small-business suppliers all supporting the offshore industry.

This is in part because the Gulf of America is an essential supply-chain hub. Many rigs, fabrication yards, shipyards and service companies are clustered in the Gulf region, which means lease sales help maintain not just production, but the industry that supports it.

Every lease sale brings in billions of dollars in federal revenue, part of which flows directly back to states and local governments through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA). Those dollars fund coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and infrastructure upgrades helping the same communities that make American energy possible. The state of Louisiana has used offshore dollars to restore barrier islands and rebuild natural storm buffers.

Every postponed lease sale and delayed approval chips away at America’s competitiveness. Offshore projects require 10 to 15 years from exploration to first production, so uncertainty today means reduced output in the 2030s. A predictable five-year plan signals to investors that the U.S. is open for business and willing to compete globally for market share, offshore technology and thousands of jobs.

Bottom Line: A Predictable Offshore Future Helps Power American Energy

The five-year offshore leasing plan is not just about drilling, it’s about direction. For years, the absence of a clear plan has undermined America’s commitment to energy leadership. By publishing a strong, balanced program, the administration can secure domestic supply, protect consumers from volatility, fund coastal resilience and keep American workers leading the world in what we do best safe and responsible offshore production.

When the United States invests in its own energy future, Americans not only win at the pump, but also ensure a reliable and secure energy supply to meet the nation’s growing energy needs.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eid_favicon_new.png,N,,2025-12-03 22:01:36.993658

As we confront the aftermath of a disastrous COP30, we not only face a warming planet, but we also find ourselves approaching a crisis of hope. With new projections showing that our planet will warm to 2.5C over pre-industrial levels – a full degree over the Paris Agreement goal – and the United States nowhere to be seen, it is now clear: there is no one coming to save us.

I am a lifelong climate activist working for Chesapeake Climate Action Network, a national progressive advocacy group that was intimately involved in passing Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). For the cynics among us, the afternoon the IRA was signed into law was a sad one. As much as it did, anyone who could do the math knew it didn’t do enough, quickly enough, to avoid the worst of the coming climate disasters.

But not everything is doom and gloom. Clean energy technology is becoming more efficient, despite the Trump administration eviscerating tax credits and crippling projects. Carbon capture technologies, too, have developed at a startling rate, and climate scientists largely agree that they need to be part of the solution. However, those same scientists admit that these technologies will not be scaled up in time to help us avert the climate tipping points that we are rapidly approaching. We are already hitting tipping points that we thought were decades away. Many of them, such as melting permafrost in the Arctic, release more carbon and perpetuate the climate crisis, further lowering the odds of preventing the worst-case scenario.

So what other tools are at our disposal when – not if – temperatures continue to rise? Hundreds of climate scientists from around the world, including one of America’s most influential climate scientists, James Hansen, believe that solar geoengineering may be the only tool that could allow us to avoid these tipping points.

Simply put, geoengineering, or sunlight reflective methods (SRM), is the concept of using a light-reflecting aerosol, such as those found in volcanic eruptions, to reflect 1-2% of sunlight in the stratosphere back into space. This could temporarily cool the Earth while we are still phasing out fossil fuels. The concept isn’t new: American scientists have been thinking about it since Benjamin Franklin speculated that a volcanic eruption in Iceland was the reason Paris was so brisk in 1784.

Critics often warn that SRM poses a moral hazard, arguing it could reduce the incentive to cut emissions. But the global energy market is already decarbonizing: clean energy is now cheaper and will soon outcompete fossil fuels entirely. However, around the world, climate policy is stalling. We may be winning the long-term battle, but we are losing on the timescale that matters most for people already facing extreme heat, droughts, and displacement. So, what progress are we really risking by considering SRM?

As climate justice advocates, our moral priority should be protecting those communities today. If SRM can help prevent dangerous tipping points while we continue to decarbonize, it deserves serious consideration.

There are many other questions that SRM researchers need to answer – and it is time we devote public resources to determine what they are. At the same time, climate justice organizations must lead the way in creating a governance framework that puts the most vulnerable countries in the driver’s seat for conversations around SRM.

Bill Gates made some misleading statements in his recent treatise on why the climate needs to be deprioritized, but he was right about one thing: the top priority for the climate movement should be the human impacts of climate change. We activists cannot succumb to groupthink or complacency – all ideas should be on the table.

If scientists find that SRM can save more lives than breaching climate tipping points would take, and governance experts create a system where vulnerable countries can lead this conversation, then it is time for the climate movement to challenge our own orthodoxy. Especially as scientists discuss SRM methods that could be deployed specifically to prevent tipping points, SRM begins to look more plausible than many in the climate movement realize.

The recent COP summit in Brazil reminded us that another crisis we face is one of imagination. Let us not shy away from bold measures that could save us from a failure we have spent our entire lives fighting against. The stakes are simply too high.

But high natural gas prices and growing demand for electricity are playing a bigger role in stoking demand for coal.
Last year, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per million British thermal units.
American LNG shipments are expected to increase 25 percent this year, putting upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices.
Analysts predict the artificial intelligence boom will need 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, drastically driving up U.S. energy demand.","Electricity markets used to be predictable. In 2025, they’re anything but.

Coal is enjoying a revival, natural gas generation is down, and renewables are forging ahead despite political headwinds. Some of that is driven by annual idiosyncrasies like weather, which increased electricity demand this year, and President Donald Trump’s dismantling of environmental regulations and the Inflation Reduction Act.

But most of the market’s upheaval is due to wider economic trends that burst into full view this year. Namely: the growth in U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas and rising electricity demand from data centers.

“I feel like we’re at the edge of the storm,” Ric O’Connell, the executive director of the consulting firm GridLab, told me. “The storm is the load growth that is showing up in the next couple of years. The IRA is going away, and gas prices are potentially going to spike. The next couple of years could be messy.”

The trends mark a fundamental shift from the previous decade, which was defined by stagnant power demand, low natural gas prices, coal plant retirements and a wave of renewable installations.

Firing up coal

Coal generation was up 13 percent through the end of September compared with the same time last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Part of the increase is due to a cold winter and hot summer, said Andy Blumenfeld, an analyst who tracks coal markets at the consulting company McCloskey by OPIS.

But high natural gas prices and growing demand for electricity are playing a bigger role in stoking demand for coal. Last year, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per million British thermal units. This year, gas prices are on track to average $3.50 per million BTU.

When utilities see gas prices like that, they tend to fire up coal.

Coal has enjoyed mini-revivals before, most recently in 2022. What makes this year different is that coal’s rebound is playing out at a time when the U.S. is shipping more gas abroad while demand for power grows at home.

American LNG shipments are expected to increase 25 percent this year, putting upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices.

Power-hungry AI

At the same time, technology companies and data center developers are hoovering up all the megawatts they can find.

Analysts predict the artificial intelligence boom will need 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, drastically driving up U.S. energy demand. Electricity demand nationwide was up 2 percent through the first nine months of the year, according to EIA data.

All that is a recipe for generating electricity from coal plants that once sat idle. In 2023 and 2024, coal plants ran at 42 percent of their capacity. This year, they are running at almost half-capacity.

But even as coal has enjoyed a rebound, it still lags behind renewables. Wind and solar generated 646 terawatt-hours of electricity in the U.S. through September, eclipsing the 561 TWh produced by coal. Gas, meanwhile, was down 4 percent to almost 1,384 TWh.

The strong renewable numbers stem in large part from another strong year for solar installations. But O’Connell expects those numbers to fall starting in 2027 because of Trump’s moves to end clean energy tax credits and make it more difficult to build wind and solar projects.

“Those are going to be felt in five years when projects that should have come online don’t come online,” O’Connell said.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Brian Dabbs breaks down how the Trump administration is releasing federal energy assistance as it proposes to dismantle the program.

Power Centers

Fuel economy rollback

Trump announced today that he plans to scrap Biden-era fuel economy rules for cars and trucks, in his latest move to wind back policies that benefit electric cars and cut planet-warming emissions.

The administration is proposing to scrap rules that require cars to get 50.4 mpg by model year 2031 — and replace them with standards that only require a fleetwide average fuel economy of 34.5 mpg by that year, Jean Chemnick writes. Cars now get an average of 24.4 mpg, according to the Department of Energy.

Trump aides are promoting the changes as a way to make cars more affordable, as rising consumer costs plague Republicans in the polls, writes Chris Marquette. But environmentalists say the move will mean Americans pay more for gasoline, and industry analysts say easing fuel economy requirements is unlikely to decrease new vehicle prices. Factors like tariffs, supply chain issues and the increasing size of vehicles play more of a role in sticker shock, they say.

Alaskan pushback on Trump’s offshore drilling plan

Alaska’s Republican senators have reached out to the Interior Department about plans to lease parcels of the state’s waters for oil drilling, Amelia Davidson writes.

Interior’s five-year plan, released last month, included plans for expanded drilling in the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as Alaskan waters including the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in the Arctic region. But Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan said they’d prefer the department expanded drilling in the Cook Inlet in southern Alaska.

Sullivan told Amelia he had already brought his concerns to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“He was listening,” Sullivan said of Burgum. “I mean, what they wanted to do was put out an expansive plan and then they’re going to listen. I told him it was very important to listen to the communities.”

Democrats embrace natural gas

Leaders in New England are opening up to new gas projects after spending a decade trying to curb their reliance on it — even as three major clean energy projects near completion, your host writes.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) has talked about building pipelines, while lawmakers in Massachusetts flirted with weighing down their climate goals. It’s a response to rising electricity prices — and the long and complicated slog of building two offshore wind projects and a transmission line for Canadian hydropower in an increasingly difficult political climate.

“Time is already a nonrenewable resource, but then you recognize that the more time it takes to build any of this stuff, the more uncertainty you’re exposed to,” said Ben Downing, a former Democratic Massachusetts state senator who authored a landmark clean energy bill in 2016. “I think that if there’s one consistent theme throughout the last decade, it’s that.”

In Other News

Still bad, though: The journal Nature retracted a study today that predicted climate change would cause far more economic damage than previous estimates had suggested. When data flaws were corrected, the study’s prediction of a 62 percent decline in economic output by 2100 decreased to a 23 percent decline.

Corn’s climate cost: Corn comes with a heavy climate impact because its growth relies on the use of fertilizer that releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, when it breaks down in the soil.

While the new Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards weren’t revealed in a White House announcement Wednesday afternoon, the presidents of Ford and Stellantis said they were more “aligned with customer demand” and would lead to more affordable vehicles for Americans.

“This CAFE standard that is aligned with customer demand is the right move for a lot of reasons,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said. “This allows us to invest in affordable vehicles made in the U.S., which we will take the lead on, and will allow us to make vehicles more affordable.”

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said that the revised regulations were “reconciled with real customers’ demand” and that the company is planning to increase production by 50%, creating 5,000 jobs.

The president said the rollback would make cars more affordable while enabling consumer choice.

“People were paying too much for a car that didn’t work as well. And now they’re going to be environmentally friendly but they’re gonna cost you a lot less,” said President Donald Trump.

To illustrate his point, Trump shared an anecdote about Ford having to make “numerous electric cars” to “sell one Ford 150"" based on previous policies accelerating the transition to electric vehicles.

“They were willing to lose money on building two or three electric cars that they couldn't sell in order to make some money on the 150 because the 150 is a monster,” Trump said, with Farley nodding in the background.

The revised standards will save Americans an average of $1,000 on new cars and $109 billion in total over the next five years, according to the White House.

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the changes would enable more Americans to buy cars and boost automobile manufacturing in the U.S.

“These rules are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and [Pete] Buttigieg wants them to build, which is important, but also this is important for American jobs,” Duffy said. “So this is jobs, this is freedom, and this is common sense.”

Mills has been appointed Distinguished Fellow and will join the institute's Advisory Board, where he will contribute research for the American Energy + AI Initiative on the real-world power required to support AI and data center growth.

Mills is executive director of the National Center for Energy Analytics and a contributing editor at City Journal. He also serves as a faculty fellow at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. Over the course of his career, Mills has testified before Congress numerous times and briefed state public-service commissions and legislators. Most recently, he testified about AI and data centers before the House Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs in April 2025.

His first project for the Hamm Institute, a new joint study titled ""The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts,"" provides one of the most detailed looks to date at how surging AI deployment will shape electricity demand, fuel use and the broader economy.

""AI will be one of the most power-hungry technologies in history, and Mark's work gives utilities, policymakers and investors a clear forecast of what that means in practice,"" said Dr. Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute. ""His analysis grounds the American Energy + AI Initiative in facts about generation, infrastructure and timing, not slogans. We are honored to have him as both a distinguished scholar and advisor as we map out a path to reliable, affordable power for the AI era.""

Mills' report, released at the institute's recent American Energy + AI Summit in Washington, D.C., quantifies the scale and pace of new generation and infrastructure needed if the United States wants to meet AI-driven demand without sacrificing reliability or economic competitiveness.

""Artificial intelligence is driving the most significant structural shift in the U.S. economy in decades. Spending on data center construction now outpaces the spending in the entire commercial office building sector,"" Mills said. ""And, with power demands for individual data centers reaching city-scale levels, the nation faces an urgent need for far more energy, and supplying it quickly and reliably.

""If AI delivers on the key promise of boosting productivity, over the coming decade the nation will see GDP expand by some $10 trillion more than current, anemic, forecasts — but only if we allow the building of the power infrastructure required. Enabling AI's promises means expanding, not constraining, our energy systems.""

As a Distinguished Fellow and Advisory Board member, Mills will:

Provide the energy demand and power capacity portfolio of the American Energy + AI Initiative, including follow-on studies and briefings for utilities, regulators and investors.

Advise the Hamm Institute on research priorities and metrics that reflect real-world power system constraints.

Support the institute's workforce efforts by turning demand forecasts into clear guidance for universities, training programs and employers on the skills and roles needed to build and operate AI-era power systems.

The American Energy + AI Initiative, led by the Hamm Institute, is focused on near-term solutions to deliver the power required for AI-scale data centers and advanced manufacturing, while strengthening U.S. and allied energy security. Mills' research will serve as the initiative's baseline forecast of AI-driven electricity demand and the generation, fuel and infrastructure needed to meet it.

The full study, produced in partnership with the National Center for Energy Analytics, ""The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts,"" is available on the Hamm Institute's website.

Let's not even talk about my brief rebellion against this system in my 20s -- let's just say it didn't work.

So I may be a bit biased based on experience here, but I don't love the Illinois toll system. And the toll roads and turnpikes in neighboring Indiana and Ohio haven't always treated me well. Not to mention the cost can pile up when you are driving all the way across a state.

On the other hand, the logic of charging only those drivers who use the road, should, in theory, make sense.

So, what do you say? Should we keep toll roads, even if we get incidents like the one I reported yesterday? Should we get rid of toll roads under the assumption that just about all drivers will use the freeways once in a while, so it's still fair to tax those folks or charge them via whatever means roads are funded near you? Should we only toll tunnels and bridges?

This may get political, so you've been warned -- play nice or get banned. We do read the comments.

Sound off below.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May.
Company officials say having dedicated, efficient generation will help ensure the data center — and other customers — receive reliable power.
Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center.
“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” said May.","Entergy Louisiana has broken ground on two new natural gas power plants in Richland Parish, part of a wider plan to support Meta’s upcoming data center and modernize the utility’s generation fleet.

Company officials said Monday that the combined-cycle combustion turbine (CCCT) facilities — together expected to produce about 1,500 megawatts of natural gas generation capacity — will improve reliability, lower emissions, and help integrate more renewable energy over time.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

The larger project, known as the Franklin Farms Power Station, was approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission (PSC) in August and is billed as a major economic catalyst for north Louisiana.

Entergy estimates the initiative will generate billions in capital investment and support thousands of construction and technology jobs in the region. PSC Commissioner Foster Campbell, who represents the area, called the groundbreaking “a bright day for northeast Louisiana.”

The plants are also central to Entergy’s agreement to serve Meta’s roughly $800-million data center, one of the largest economic development projects in the region’s history.

Meta expects its facility to support more than 5,000 construction jobs and about 500 permanent operational jobs once completed.

Company officials say having dedicated, efficient generation will help ensure the data center — and other customers — receive reliable power.

Additionally, Entergy said all customers will directly benefit from the arrangement.

Under the 15-year agreement, Meta will pay the full cost of the energy infrastructure needed to serve the site and contribute to systemwide costs, including storm recovery.

Entergy estimates these contributions will save its customers about $650 million and reduce storm-related charges by roughly 10 percent.

The new CCCT facilities’ next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service, the company said.

“I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project,” said May during the groundbreaking.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers.

In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers across the state.

“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” said May. “Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana’s energy future — one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.”

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, he added, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2696887997.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 20:01:04.459240

The president said he would significantly scale back the Biden administration’s effort to spur the sale of battery-powered vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The move would effectively gut one of the country’s most significant efforts to address climate change.

Trump said that his proposal, which is set to be finalized next year, would save Americans $109 billion over five years and shave $1,000 off the average cost of a new car. The new policy frees automakers to sell more pickups and sport utility vehicles, which are usually much more profitable than smaller cars.

Environmentalists criticized Trump’s decision. Carmakers publicly praised the announcement, though some have privately fretted that they are being shuffled around by conflicting policies. The major U.S. car companies have already invested billions of dollars to produce electric vehicles and batteries.

The C.E.O. of General Motors told my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin today that the company would continue to develop motors that are fuel-efficient and cleaner, even if federal standards no longer required them to do so. She was one of roughly a dozen guests at this year’s DealBook Summit. See what Scott Bessent, Gavin Newsom, Erika Kirk and others said in their interviews.

In other climate news: A prestigious science journal retracted a study that predicted that climate change would cause catastrophic economic damage by the end of the century.

Under the plans, the military would attempt to rescue helpless survivors — whom it would be a war crime to target — but it would try to kill them if they took what the U.S. deemed to be a hostile action, like communicating with suspected cartel members.

The plans could raise more questions about a second strike on a boat on Sept. 2 that killed two survivors of a first strike. One survivor radioed for help, the U.S. officials said. Adm. Frank Bradley, the operation’s commander, interpreted the purported communications as meaning that the survivors were still in the fight, and ordered the second strike.

In other Trump administration news:

A Pentagon investigator’s report concluded that Hegseth’s use of Signal risked endangering U.S. troops.

Trump said that he would pardon Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democratic lawmaker from Texas who was awaiting trial on charges that he and his wife had taken roughly $600,000 worth of bribes.

Federal agents fanned out today across immigrant enclaves in the New Orleans area.

The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.
New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

‘People want the gasoline car’

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats’ efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,” said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. “We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.
Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.
In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""
That's been the reality for years now: The Obama administration set ambitious fuel economy rules, which Trump 1.0 reversed, Biden reinstated, and now Trump 2.0 is seeking to ""reset.""","The Trump administration has started the process of dramatically easing fuel economy requirements for new vehicles, part of the administration's broader pivot away from cleaner cars.

At the White House on Wednesday, surrounded by the executives from several major car companies, President Trump said the move would save consumers money by making cars cheaper.

""We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions,"" Trump said, referring to the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, often called CAFE standards. ""And all sorts of problems, all sorts of problems for automakers.""

Previous research from Consumer Reports has challenged the argument that regulations make cars more expensive. Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.

CAFE standards require that the entire fleet of vehicles sold by a given automaker, on average, get more fuel-efficient over time. Automakers who fall short have previously needed to either pay hefty fines, or buy credits from a company that over-performs on efficiency, like Tesla and other all-electric automakers.

The Trump administration has already defanged the existing CAFE standards by eliminating the fines associated with them, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Under Former President Joe Biden, the rules called for vehicles to get 2% more efficient every year; the Trump administration is now proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline and increase by .5% annually.

The proposed change now enters a period of public comment; the Department of Transportation will collect input from companies and citizens before finalizing the rule.

The administration has already been working to roll back tailpipe standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, which are designed to cut pollution from vehicles. The two sets of rules have overlapping effects, with both of them pushing automakers toward cleaner vehicles.

Meanwhile, during the second Trump presidency Congress has also eliminated the consumer tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, decided to end a tax credit for installing an EV charger in June 2026, earlier than planned, and voted to strike down federal waivers that let California require automakers to build zero-emission vehicles. The Trump administration also temporarily delayed a program to use federal money to build a high-speed EV charger network.

The policy shift was no surprise. Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.

Trump has framed the policy rollback as a gift to the auto industry. And that's partially true: Large trucks and SUVs may be inefficient, but they're popular and profitable, and selling more of them without any penalty is a financial boon to automakers. In earnings calls this fall, multiple executives noted that the regulatory rollback will boost earnings and help offset the cost of tariffs.

Electric vehicle adoption in the U.S. has moved slower than automakers had expected. Some automakers have said made some of the Biden-era policies not just challenging but unworkable.

In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""

But automakers are also navigating a changing global market, with many countries continuing to prioritize climate action. The popularity of high-quality, affordable Chinese EVs has raised questions about whether legacy automakers can compete. So Farley's statement also promised that ""We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability.""

For companies, which need to plan their future vehicle line-ups years in advance, it's challenging when rules whipsaw back and forth with each change in administration. That's been the reality for years now: The Obama administration set ambitious fuel economy rules, which Trump 1.0 reversed, Biden reinstated, and now Trump 2.0 is seeking to ""reset.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5920x3330+0+172/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F41%2F41e21b9a4746b037eb9bea98f959%2Fgettyimages-2249777843.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 19:03:58.385467

Otherwise, your data will be deleted if pv magazine has processed your request or the purpose of data storage is fulfilled.","The U.S. DoE has renamed the Colorado-based NREL the National Laboratory of the Rockies.

A statement available on the laboratory’s website says that the change, announced this week and effective immediately, reflects the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation.

Audrey Robertson, Assistant Secretary of Energy at the DoE, added that the “energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL.”

“We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources,” Robertson explained. “Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand.”

The laboratory first opened in 1977 under the name Solar Energy Research Institute following an oil crisis earlier in the decade. Its name was changed to NREL in 1991 by President George H.W Bush, at which time it was designated a national laboratory of the DOE. There are currently seventeen such laboratories across the U.S. spanning science, nuclear energy and security, environmental management, fossil energy and carbon management, and energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Writing on LinkedIn, senior scientist at the Colorado laboratory, Craig Perkins, said it was “a sad day to see renewable energy officially de-emphasized at our lab.”

“I feel bad for all the people who came here with renewable energy as a passion and who now have to make some hard choices about their futures,” Perkins wrote. “On the bright side, solar power and other renewable energies will eventually prevail over the current political winds, guaranteed. It just might be elsewhere.”

In November, the DoE released a new organizational chart removing groups focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions.

It calls for resetting CAFE standards for model years 2022-2031.
The new standards would be “developed without consideration of electric vehicles and credit trading,” and would call for a modest fuel economy increase.
For passenger vehicles, the proposal calls for an increase of 0.5% annually for model years 2023 through 2026.
What the New Math Means While it’s hard to wrap fuel economy figures around percentages, the Department of Transportation said the proposal would result in a fleet average fuel economy rating of 34.5 mpg by the 2031 model year.","President Trump has announced plans to reset the “costly and unlawful Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards” enacted by the previous administration.

A fact sheet put out by the White House was light on specifics, but said Trump was “returning CAFE standards to levels that can actually be met with conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles.”

They said this stands in contrast to the “unrealistic fuel economy targets” that the Biden Administration had approved, which would have “effectively resulted in an electric vehicle mandate.”

More: 50.4 MPG Is The Magic Number As New Fuel Economy Standards Announced

The White House went on to claim the previous standards were impossible to meet with available technologies for gas cars and would have “compelled widespread shifts to EVs that American consumers did not ask for, accompanied by significant cost-of-living increases.”

They went on to say the average cost of a new car would have risen by nearly $1,000 when compared to the standards announced today.

Speaking of savings, the government said the move will save Americans $109 billion over the next five years. The White House also suggested that by enabling more people to buy newer and safer vehicles, the “reset is projected to save more than 1,500 lives and prevent nearly a quarter-million serious injuries through 2050.”

Big Changes, Less Efficiency

The Department of Transportation was more forthcoming as they revealed the Freedom Means Affordable Cars proposal. It calls for resetting CAFE standards for model years 2022-2031.

The new standards would be “developed without consideration of electric vehicles and credit trading,” and would call for a modest fuel economy increase.

For passenger vehicles, the proposal calls for an increase of 0.5% annually for model years 2023 through 2026. It would then dip to a 0.35% increase for the 2027 model year and a 0.25% increase for the 2029 to 2031 model years.

For light trucks, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is proposing a 0.5% increase for the 2023-2026 model years. It would be followed by a 0.7% increase for 2027, and then a lower 0.25% improvement for the 2029 to 2031 model years.

What the New Math Means

While it’s hard to wrap fuel economy figures around percentages, the Department of Transportation said the proposal would result in a fleet average fuel economy rating of 34.5 mpg by the 2031 model year. CAFE credit trading would also be eliminated in the 2028 model year, significantly hurting EV companies such as Tesla.

Furthermore, the proposal would “reclassify crossovers and small SUVs as passenger automobiles instead of light trucks.” In essence, it’ll be like making vehicles on ‘easy mode.’

Once the proposal is published in the Federal Register, it will kick off a 45-day public comment period. The move will likely prove divisive, but it has become increasingly clear that Americans aren’t ready to go fully electric and the transition will be far more gradual than many proponents hoped for.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 20:00:07.206368

It relied heavily on an assessment from EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program, which has faced questions about its transparency, authorization, and scientific methods. As a result, a flawed evaluation may lead to regulations that are more restrictive than necessary for this important chemistry, with potential implications for the U.S. economy and domestic production.

“EPA’s updated draft analysis incorporates important scientific principles long supported by the Panel and other scientific bodies, including the recognition of a portal-of-entry threshold mode of action, the finding that sensory irritation is the most sensitive endpoint and protective of effects for all durations, that formaldehyde does not follow Haber’s Law because effects are driven by concentration rather than duration, and that controlled human exposure studies provide stronger scientific rigor than observational epidemiology. These updates help align the TSCA process with the best available science and improve the scientific foundation of EPA’s evaluation.

“The Panel has consistently supported a transparent and scientifically sound approach to chemical risk assessment. In prior comments, we noted concerns with the earlier evaluation, including the importance of using the best available science and better accounting for real-world exposure scenarios.

“Formaldehyde is integral to modern life, and businesses and families rely on the important products it enables. Without robust formaldehyde manufacturing in the United States, we could face increased product prices, reduced economic output, and a loss of the U.S.’s competitive edge.

“We remain committed to working constructively with the EPA and all stakeholders throughout this process. Our goal is to support a balanced and credible risk evaluation that protects public health while recognizing the important contributions of this building block chemistry.”",https://www.americanchemistry.com/var/site/storage/images/3/9/9/2/2993-2-eng-US/Government-EPA-Building.png,N,,2025-12-03 18:03:11.344288

Gov. Josh Stein, who created the task force in August, also opposed Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike in a statement Tuesday. Duke is seeking a 15% increase over the next two years, which could add $20 to $30 a month to household bills by 2028. Stein praised Attorney General Jeff Jackson for intervening in the case, calling the increase “simply too high” when “families are struggling to make ends meet.”

Other WRAL Top Stories

Jackson said his office stepped in to make sure customers aren’t paying more than necessary.

""It’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”

Tuesday’s task force meeting, chaired by Environmental Secretary Reid Wilson and Rep. Kyle Hall, focused on how other states are responding to the data center boom now sweeping across North Carolina. Experts from neighboring states warned that fast-growing electricity demand is already reshaping grids nationwide and forcing regulators to rethink who should pay for costly new power plants and transmission lines.

Luke Wilson, executive director of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, told members his state expects peak demand to climb as much as 60% by the 2030s, driven largely by data centers. “You have to make sure growth pays for growth,” Wilson said. He described Indiana’s new rules that require large users to cover most of the cost of new generation built specifically to serve them.

Virginia State Corporation Commission member Kelsey Baggett said her state has seen hundreds of data center projects line up for grid access, especially in Northern Virginia. The surge prompted regulators there to create a separate electric rate class to ensure big tech users pay their share. “We have to make sure costs are allocated fairly,” Baggett said.

North Carolina faces similar pressures. Duke has warned that electricity demand from data centers, manufacturing and electrification could grow much faster than previously forecast. Under the state’s current structure, changed this summer by Senate Bill 266, residential customers could shoulder a greater share of the cost of fuel and purchased power, while large commercial customers pay less. Some task force members raised concerns that rapid growth could leave households covering more of the long-term costs of new infrastructure unless the state updates its rules.

In a statement, Duke Energy said:

“We do not take any request to increase rates lightly, knowing that our investments to meet North Carolina’s growing energy needs will be carefully evaluated by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Staff, and intervenors such as customer advocates and the Attorney General. We look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue with all parties as the review moves forward next year.”

The task force is expected to deliver recommendations in February on how North Carolina can meet rising demand while keeping electricity reliable, clean and affordable.

Saline Twp. data center proposal sparks fears over energy costs and transparency

Well, one of the largest in the country is now planned for Saline Township.

I got a chance to talk to residents, a power systems expert, and Michigan’s attorney general about how they’re viewing this potentially historic project.

“Well, already, instead of starlight, construction light streams through my bedroom window,"" said Kathryn Haushalter, who lives in Saline Township.

That’s because OpenAI, Oracle, and developer Related Digital are in the early stages of building a 1.4 gigawatt data center in Saline Township, right on Kathryn Haushalter’s doorstep.

“It’s just all going to change. We’re afraid for our well water, our electric bill. It’s just not going to be the house we were hoping for,"" she said.

DTE would supply the needed electricity.

We’ve heard from DTE that they say it won’t raise the cost of utilities, but Kathryn is skeptical.

“We only have to look at other states and how it’s happened, and definitely the customers get saddled with the bill,"" she said.

Saline Township residents raise concerns, anger against incoming data center

DTE wants the Michigan Public Services Commission to grant expedited ex parte approval of its special contracts with the AI data center. If granted, this would bypass any investigation or challenge of the terms of the contract by the public or the attorney general.

DTE has said the customer could terminate the deal if it’s not approved by December 5.

“It shouldn’t be rushed. If this is rushed, people are going to get hurt. Real families are going to get hurt by this,"" said Josh Lebaron.

Lebaron lives just 500 yards from the planned AI data center.

“I’d rather have a nuclear power plant than a data center. Cause at least that would add to the grid,"" he said.

He, too, feels like everything has happened quickly.

“I heard about it vaguely in August. I kind of assumed that the appropriate authorities were taking care of it. And then about two weeks ago, I realized that was not happening,"" he said. “I wanted to live out in the country in peace. I’ve spent the last 10 years remodeling my farmhouse. I’m almost done with it, and now they’re building a giant data center next to me.”

And he has an opinion on why Saline Township was chosen.

“Well, it’s a really small rural township with 2,000 people. So legally it’s going to be much easier to roll them over,"" said Lebaron.

Rabab Haider is an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan. She tells me the electricity infrastructure in Michigan is around 100 years old, and changing weather patterns and new load growth mean it needs upgrading.

“It’s a really large cost. And when we think about the price increases that we’ve seen over the past couple of years in electricity prices, and residential electricity prices, for example, the vast majority of that actually comes from the upgrades that we’re running on our system today,"" said Haider.

Not AI, up to now.

""A big concern for these people, where these data centers are supposed to go in, is that their utility rates will increase, but they’ve been told that that’s not going to happen. Is it possible that an AI data center could go in and their utility rates do not increase?"" I asked.

“I think it is possible,"" she said.

Haider said it depends on the contracts being signed.

“If a data center says that we’re going to build a megawatt facility and we’re going to make sure that we will be paying a certain minimum amount or we will consume a minimum amount of power, you have a steady revenue stream that you could basically offset costs of any potential infrastructure upgrades,"" she said. “You could also imagine that a data center company could choose to foot the bill for certain upgrades that would otherwise then get allocated to different rates payers. So then it really comes down to the way these contracts are designed and how rate approvals go through our utility and public service commissions.”

DTE issued a statement reaffirming the data center will not increase rates for existing customers, also saying in part: ""Recently passed legislation by the state of Michigan ensures our customers will NOT subsidize data center rates. Furthermore, Michigan’s regulatory process allows a company to file for ex parte (or uncontested) approval of contracts if there is no cost-of-service increase to customers.""

At the request of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, the Michigan Public Service Commission agreed to hold a two-hour virtual public hearing on DTE’s ex parte application for approval of its special contracts to provide electricity to the 1.4 gigawatt data center in Saline Township on December 3.

She says right now, the public isn’t even able to read an unredacted copy of the contract.

I brought the concerns of Saline residents to Nessel directly.

""What should Michiganders expect and insist, when it comes to next steps?"" I asked.

“Those feelings are absolutely legitimate. This does appear to be a rush job. It does appear as though the intention of the public service commission is to rubber-stamp whatever DTE wants… because I have no other explanation why they would not have a contested hearing unless they want to make sure that nobody knows exactly what it is that DTE is asking for,"" said Dana Nessel, Michigan's attorney general.

It’s a sentiment echoed by Kathryn Haushalter.

“I feel like it’s just a checklist of things that they have to do before they can just go ahead anyway and get what they want and put this data center here,"" she said.

I asked about where the public can make their voices heard, and was told the best place right now is on the MPSC’s link for public comment, also to attend that virtual hearing, which is taking place at 6:30 p.m.

We’ll see if they end up granting a contested hearing, but according to the attorney general, approval of those contracts without public scrutiny would be unprecedented.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3421f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F55%2F68e7ab624a158e838aff32c6a8f1%2Fphoto-collage-png.png,N,,2025-12-03 19:04:10.359124

JOHN,,,,,https://abc7chicago.com/post/trump-plans-weaken-vehicle-mileage-rules-limit-air-pollution/18245873/,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
The rules will increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said.
The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles.
Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles' average efficiency.","WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""From day one I've been taking action to make buying a car more affordable."" Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,"" Trump said.

Rule change will save money, Trump says

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes. They had complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was ""a win for customers and common sense.""

""As America's largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,"" Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration's actions to ""realign"" the standards ""with real world market conditions.""

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback in mileage standards.

""In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation's most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

""Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program.

Polluting cars to stay on road

""This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,"" she said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV ""mandate,"" referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden's target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and more 4,870 tons a year of smog components nitrogen oxide volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles' average efficiency.

A: I am extremely pleased with the real-world experience of the ASU instructors. Their experience brings perspective, examples and analogies, and insight that exceeds my expectations.

Q: Why did you choose ASU?

A: First of all, ASU has a stellar reputation, and I have a tremendous respect for the faculty, staff, students and graduates I have met from ASU. The program was perfect for my intentions and gave me an opportunity to succeed.

Q: Which professor taught you the most important lesson while at ASU?

A: That’s a difficult question. Professor Troy Rule was incredible in Energy Law and Policies, and Professor Catherine Barnard has been amazing in Contracts and in Business Relationships. However, I believe that the most influential professor was Professor Larry Bridgesmith in my Negotiations class. His approach combining engineering, neuroscience and psychology disciplines was extremely influential and impactful. The material in this course assists me daily, professionally and personally.

Q: What’s the best piece of advice you’d give to those still in school?

A: Be humble, be curious and be ready to find nuggets of wisdom at any point of your journey.

Q: What are your plans after graduation?

A: I am continuing in my role as CEO of a company producing zero-emission generators for the federal government, industry and municipalities. We have a great responsibility to provide power to citizens sustainably and without pollution, and our company is addressing the technical challenges, market reluctance and the shifts in policy and public support.

Q: How has this degree helped you in your professional journey?

A: I am better equipped to understand policy issues related to energy, better able to guide our company from startup to sustained to growing and better able to create partnerships and relationships with legal frameworks.

Q: If someone gave you $40 million to solve one problem on our planet, what would you tackle?

A: I would use the $40 million to create a clean-energy microgrid that would provide zero-emission for the entire Arizona State University campus, integrating renewable energy with hydrogen storage and dispatchable power to provide 100% clean energy for the campus. This microgrid aligns with ASU’s sustainability goals, implements proven technologies from STEM backgrounds, builds upon systems currently funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Army Research Laboratory, and is achievable with existing systems, suppliers and within the (overstressed) electrical grid.

Arizona State University aligns with the mission of sustainability and advancing systems to improve society. The technology and systems exist today, and ASU can be the model for the nation and internationally as the clean energy leader.",https://news.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz161/files/2025-12/FJG-ASU19-0822.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 18:02:23.396299

It's been a rough run though since hitting that all-time high back in October and a key underlying factor heading into the new year, the regulatory backdrop.

We're let let's, you know, let's start with your boss, Paul. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, he's at the Dealbook conference today, Paul. You saw this.

Remind us what the Clarity Act is all about and what it would mean, Paul, for Coinbase, for your business, for the broader industry.

Well, it's great to be here. The Senate uh is considering uh their version of the Clarity Act. And what the Clarity Act uh which passed the house earlier this year, would provide for the first time is a true market structure for crypto here in the United States. Uh earlier in the year, uh Congress passed and the president signed a bill regarding stable coins, which is an important first step in providing clarity and certainty uh under the law for crypto and digital assets. But it's really time, it's essential that Congress finish the job and that's what it will do when the Senate finally passes market structure legislation in short order and the president signs it.

Paul, you mentioned stable coins there. Now, Brian Armstrong also did talk about that. He said banks are exploring stable coins after Congress passed uh the genius Act. I I'm curious, Paul, what does that mean do you think for for the adoption curve?

Well, there's no question that uh traditional financial institutions including banks now understand very well the power and the potential of stable coins to bring transformation to the financial services industry. And what it will mean, of course, is greater adoption, greater utilization and improved efficiency throughout the financial system. Uh we are pleased to see banks finally wake up to their realization that it's time for innovation in the way we move money around in the internet and we're delighted to have them as partners in this uh in this space and uh look forward to their full participation.

Now now Paul, it wasn't just Brian Armstrong your colleague at Deal book. We had Larry Fink there too. There's another big name. He said Bitcoin, that was interesting. He said Bitcoin remains heavily influenced, Mr. Fink says, by leveraged players. And I'm just I'm curious how you what you make of that, Paul. I mean, how much risk does leverage sort of still pose here and how does how does Coinbase mitigate that?

Well, Coinbase has provided access to Bitcoin for millions of Americans really going back to the earliest days of crypto. Uh but it's a a market like any other market that evolves with time and it's natural to expect that uh individuals who may have been less familiar or even less comfortable uh custodying their own Bitcoin and holding it in their own wallets, would want want to rely upon intermediaries of all types um in order to uh fully participate and finally participate in this market. Uh we are seeing leverage and additional intermediaries relying upon leverage, introduce uh new options for consumers to participate uh in the Bitcoin revolution. Uh and and that of course will require there to be uh new standards, new new new requirements and new safeguards put in place. But we think that uh the market structural legislation is key to uh facilitating that.

""We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions,"" Trump said, referring to the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, often called CAFE standards.
Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.
Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.
In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""","The Trump administration has started the process of dramatically easing fuel economy requirements for new vehicles, part of the administration's broader pivot away from cleaner cars.

At the White House on Wednesday, surrounded by the executives from several major car companies, President Trump said the move would save consumers money by making cars cheaper.

""We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions,"" Trump said, referring to the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, often called CAFE standards. ""And all sorts of problems, all sorts of problems for automakers.""

Previous research from Consumer Reports has challenged the argument that regulations make cars more expensive. Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.

CAFE standards require that the entire fleet of vehicles sold by a given automaker, on average, get more fuel-efficient over time. Automakers who fall short have previously needed to either pay hefty fines, or buy credits from a company that over-performs on efficiency, like Tesla and other all-electric automakers.

The Trump administration has already defanged the existing CAFE standards by eliminating the fines associated with them, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Under Former President Joe Biden, the rules called for vehicles to get 2% more efficient every year; the Trump administration is now proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline and increase by .5% annually.

The proposed change now enters a period of public comment; the Department of Transportation will collect input from companies and citizens before finalizing the rule.

The administration has already been working to roll back tailpipe standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, which are designed to cut pollution from vehicles. The two sets of rules have overlapping effects, with both of them pushing automakers toward cleaner vehicles.

Meanwhile, during the second Trump presidency Congress has also eliminated the consumer tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, decided to end a tax credit for installing an EV charger in June 2026, earlier than planned, and voted to strike down federal waivers that let California require automakers to build zero-emission vehicles. The Trump administration also temporarily delayed a program to use federal money to build a high-speed EV charger network.

The policy shift was no surprise. Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.

Trump has framed the policy rollback as a gift to the auto industry. And that's partially true: Large trucks and SUVs may be inefficient, but they're popular and profitable, and selling more of them without any penalty is a financial boon to automakers. In earnings calls this fall, multiple executives noted that the regulatory rollback will boost earnings and help offset the cost of tariffs.

Electric vehicle adoption in the U.S. has moved slower than automakers had expected. Some automakers have said made some of the Biden-era policies not just challenging but unworkable.

In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""

But automakers are also navigating a changing global market, with many countries continuing to prioritize climate action. The popularity of high-quality, affordable Chinese EVs has raised questions about whether legacy automakers can compete. So Farley's statement also promised that ""We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability.""

For companies, which need to plan their future vehicle line-ups years in advance, it's challenging when rules whipsaw back and forth with each change in administration. That's been the reality for years now: The Obama administration set ambitious fuel economy rules, which Trump 1.0 reversed, Biden reinstated, and now Trump 2.0 is seeking to ""reset.""

Farley obliquely noted that risk in a conversation with investors in October. He explained why Ford was continuing to move ahead with plans for an affordable electric pickup, despite regulations shifting to no longer support EVs. ""We expect adoption will increase over time and the market continue to evolve,"" Farley said. ""And maybe the regulations evolve.""

Sue-and-settle cases are where plaintiffs go to court, negotiate consent decrees setting new policies, then are awarded payment for their attorneys’ time.

Cases are particularly prolific in environmental policy, where the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act are prominent battlegrounds for sue-and-settle.

Critics say it sets up a perverse incentive for administrations to work with environmentalists to force the government into policies that couldn’t make it through Congress. Because they are legal settlements, they are binding on future administrations, just as if they were written into law.

Open the Books, a spending watchdog, said the government reached hundreds of settlements and paid out $20.3 million in lawyers’ fees associated with those settlements from 2013 to 2024.

President Obama racked up $5.7 million of those fee awards, President Trump cut that to $3.6 million in his first four years, then President Biden oversaw a surge, to $10.9 million.

The Sierra Club made out the best, according to Open the Books, collecting more than $4 million in lawyers’ fees over that time.

Northwest Environmental Advocates, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Environmental Law & Policy Center and the Natural Resources Defense Council rounded out the top five, with each collecting at least $1 million.

Open the Books said the Trump administration made a concerted effort to limit the practice, with the Environmental Protection Agency in 2017 ordering an end to using consent decrees to circumvent the usual policymaking process.

The Biden EPA ditched those restrictions in 2022.

Weakened Fuel Economy Standards Will Harm People, the Environment While Raising Prices at the Pump

Statement by Steven Higashide, Union of Concerned Scientists

WASHINGTON (December 3, 2025)—The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced a proposal to weaken fuel economy (CAFE) standards for model year 2022 to 2031 passenger cars and trucks.

Below is a statement by Steven Higashide, director of the Clean Transportation Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“This Trump administration handout to fossil fuel industry and automakers will harm consumers and the environment. Because of CAFE standards, U.S. vehicle pollution and reliance on oil have dropped and drivers can save money by choosing more efficient vehicles. Tearing down this pillar of clean transportation will cost us all dearly.

“This year marks a half-century since Congress created the CAFE standard, which over the past 50 years has improved U.S. energy security, helped clean up the air, and saved consumers more than $5 trillion.

“The Trump administration is moving us backwards, with CAFE targets that are less stringent than what today’s fleet already achieves. Decreasing vehicle efficiency will harm public health and well-being, make the United States more vulnerable to global oil price shocks, and cost consumers more each time they fill up at the pump. This move should be seen for what it is—more short-term profit for oil and car companies and a diminished future for all of us.

“This is not the first time the CAFE standards have come under attack by the Trump administration and their allies in Congress. Earlier this year, DOT finalized an interpretive rule without public input that gave automakers a free pass to ignore the CAFE standards on the books. And Republicans’ reconciliation bill stripped NHTSA’s ability to enforce CAFE standards by zeroing out penalties for noncompliance. These standards are complementary but separate from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks, which are also being targeted for repeal by the Trump administration.”",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-12-03 18:03:01.045985

However, Duke Energy, the largest energy company in North Carolina, offers tips to help its customers reduce their utility usage and minimize the impact on their monthly bills.

Duke offers a holiday lights calculator that helps customers plan ahead and estimate the additional cost of their holiday light displays on their utility bill. By identifying the type of lights, number of bulbs per strand, and the number of hours used during the day, customers can estimate the additional cost that will be added to their monthly bill.

Large incandescent bulbs will add much more than LED bulbs. Six strings of 100 incandescent bulbs, each turned on for six hours, would add approximately $80 to a monthly bill. While six strands of 100 LED bulbs would add only about $7, and for an even more cost-effective option, the same amount of mini-LED bulbs would increase the monthly bill by only $1.

With the holidays come more cooking and baking, which, like holiday lights, will also add to the electric bill. Duke also offers a holiday cooking calculator to help customers estimate the cost of holiday cooking based on the appliance, wattage, cooking time, and average kWH per hour.

Duke also offers other money-saving tips for these cold holiday months. Thermostats can be one of the largest contributors to monthly power bills. Set the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature and lower it a degree or two when leaving. Change air filters regularly and keep up with maintenance and regular service on the heating and cooling system. On sunny days, let the sunlight in by opening drapes or blinds. And of course, wear warm clothing.

In 2022, Duke Energy implemented rolling blackouts to stabilize the energy grid during the bitter cold temperatures of the holiday season. Experts say a repeat of the 2022 blackouts is unlikely.

“Fortunately, the risk of another holiday blackout is quite low,” Jon Sanders, director of the Center for Food Power and Life, at the John Locke Foundation, told the Carolina Journal. “What happened in 2022 was a perfect storm of equipment failures, loss of expected power purchases, and the fact that the cold snap affected so much of the East Coast. Furthermore, North Carolinians were able to avoid a blackout during a heat wave last summer when the US Energy Secretary Chris Wright granted Duke Energy an emergency order to exceed emissions levels if needed to keep the power on. Thanks to that order, Duke was able to keep the power on with 30% more coal generation than the previous day.”

By utilizing energy-efficient options and planning, cost efficiency does not need to be sacrificed during holiday festivities.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/pexels-rods-aguiar-2154709933-34208374.jpeg,N,,2025-12-03 18:03:52.083062

Funding for the grant program comes from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the Long Island Sound Partnership (LISP), with additional support from NFWF and The Zoetis Foundation.

“Estuaries and their surrounding lands and waters represent some of the most productive wildlife habitats and most economically important areas in the world,” said Jeff Trandahl, Executive Director and CEO of NFWF. “The Long Island Sound is the second-largest estuary on the East Coast and one of North America’s most biologically diverse estuaries. Its watershed stretches 16,820 square miles across five states, with more than 16,000 miles of rivers feeding fresh water into the sound.

“Sustaining the health of Long Island Sound benefits a wondrous assortment of wildlife while also ensuring prosperity for thousands of communities, large and small.”

The LISP initiated the Futures Fund in 2005 through EPA’s Long Island Sound Office and NFWF. The grant program has a strong history of making environmental improvements by supporting people and communities who value the Sound and take a direct role in its future.

Since its inception, the Futures Fund has invested $68 million in 688 projects. The program has generated an additional $87 million in grantee-matching contributions toward these projects, bringing the total conservation impact to $167 million. The projects have reduced 130,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the Sound, restored 862 acres of fish and wildlife habitat, treated 212 million gallons of stormwater pollution, and engaged 5 million people in protecting and restoring the Sound.

“This year’s Futures Fund projects will support water quality improvements, habitat restoration, and other critical efforts across the watershed that are vital to protecting Long Island Sound,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Mark Sanborn. “Long Island Sound is a national treasure, and this funding exemplifies EPA’s commitment to supporting the economic and recreational benefits the Sound offers to millions of people.”

“EPA is proud to support conservation and restoration efforts in the Long Island Sound, working alongside our state and local partners,” said EPA Region 2 Administrator Michael Martucci. “These practical projects not only preserve vital ecosystems but also help build a legacy of environmental stewardship for future generations.”

“The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) stands proudly with the Long Island Sound Partnership and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in welcoming another year of impactful Futures Fund projects across the Long Island Sound Watershed,” CT DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “In Connecticut, eleven distinct NGOs took home a total of 12 awards (Save the Sound was awarded two!) for projects ranging from riparian buffers to fish passage restoration, hands-on science programs to salt marsh restoration, and a green roof. These are just a few of the ways that today’s grantees are embracing this funding opportunity to further the health of our resources and residents across the Long Island Sound Watershed.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “DEC is committed to protecting Long Island Sound, one of New York’s most important natural resources, a vital economic engine and a place cherished by communities along its shores. The Futures Fund supports projects that strengthen the Sound’s ecosystem by improving water quality, restoring habitats, and encouraging local stewardship, while reflecting a shared commitment with our partners at EPA, NFWF, and CTDEEP. DEC applauds the awardees for the meaningful benefits their work will deliver.”

The Bigger Picture: Energy Costs in South Carolina The settlements highlight the ongoing challenge of maintaining reliable energy infrastructure while keeping rates affordable.","The South Carolina Public Service Commission (PSC) is reviewing settlements reached between Duke Energy Progress (DEP) and Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) regarding their separate proposals to increase electric rates across the state.

The agreements — reached after months of proceedings and public input — would reduce the size of the proposed increases while maintaining commitments to reliable service and customer assistance.

For many South Carolinians, understanding what these settlements mean can help them prepare for potential changes in their utility bills in the coming year.

Why This Matters

South Carolina households already pay some of the highest electricity bills in the country. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, South Carolina residents spend about 20% more on electricity than the national average.

Because of these high costs, even modest rate increases can affect family budgets, especially for older adults and those living on fixed incomes. AARP South Carolina continues to monitor developments in the energy sector to help residents understand how rate changes impact affordability and everyday living costs.

Overview of the Settlements

Both Duke Energy Progress (DEP) and Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) filed requests with the PSC in 2025 to raise residential electric rates. After negotiations among the utilities, regulators, and consumer advocates, both companies reached separate settlement agreements that are now before the PSC for review.

These settlements include several key provisions:

Return on Equity (ROE): Duke agreed to a 9.99% ROE, down from the requested 10.85%. The ROE helps determine how much profit the company can earn while recovering its costs to operate and invest in infrastructure.

Basic Facilities Charge: The monthly Residential Basic Facilities Charge — the fixed fee customers pay before using electricity — will remain at $11.78, rather than increasing to $13.00 as initially requested.

Customer Assistance Programs: Both companies have committed shareholder funds to assist customers facing financial hardship through the Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) programs.

DEP: $750,000 per year for two years.

DEC: $1.5 million per year for two years.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Savings: Duke will apply temporary bill credits, or “decrement riders,” to return federal tax savings from the Inflation Reduction Act to customers.

DEP: $10 million over two years.

DEC: $100 million over 22 months.

How This Affects Residential Customers

If the PSC approves the settlements, most residential customers will see smaller increases than originally proposed.

Duke Energy Progress (DEP) customers would see an average 7.3% increase, rather than the proposed 15%. A typical residential bill would rise about $11.23 per month instead of $21.66.

Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) customers would see an average 0.6% increase, rather than 7.6%. A typical residential bill would rise about $0.84 per month instead of $10.38.

The new rates are expected to take effect February 1, 2026, pending PSC approval.

These changes reflect efforts to balance the company’s need to maintain infrastructure with the financial realities faced by consumers across South Carolina.

Additional Settlement Provisions

In addition to rate changes, the settlements include several agreements that will shape how energy rates and programs are managed in the coming years:

Large Load Customers: By June 1, 2026, Duke and other stakeholders will jointly petition the PSC to review rate-making structures for very large customers (50 megawatts and above), such as data centers and manufacturing operations.

Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management (EE/DSM): Within six months of Duke’s planned merger approval, the company will file a petition to review its EE/DSM portfolios. These programs help reduce energy consumption, promote efficiency, and potentially lower long-term costs for customers.

Merger-Related Commitments: Both settlements outline conditions tied to the proposed combination of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, including how future rate filings will be handled and how customer benefits from federal tax credits will continue to be applied.

What Consumers Should Know

Even with smaller increases than initially proposed, electricity costs remain a growing concern for many households. AARP South Carolina encourages residents to:

Review their utility bills carefully once new rates take effect to understand how the changes apply to their usage.

Explore available assistance programs, including Duke’s Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) program and other community-based utility assistance initiatives.

Take advantage of energy efficiency programs that may help reduce monthly costs, such as weatherization and appliance upgrade rebates.

Stay informed about PSC proceedings, especially as the merger between Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas advances and new rate cases are filed.

The Bigger Picture: Energy Costs in South Carolina

The settlements highlight the ongoing challenge of maintaining reliable energy infrastructure while keeping rates affordable. As South Carolina continues to grow, the demand for energy — especially from industries, data centers, and new developments — is expected to increase.

At the same time, extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and the transition to cleaner energy sources are putting additional pressure on utilities and regulators.

Balancing these priorities will remain a central issue for state policymakers, consumer advocates, and residents alike.

AARP South Carolina will continue to follow these developments and share information to help consumers make informed decisions about energy use, assistance programs, and rate changes that affect their household budgets.

She said people should buy electric cars based on their merits, not because of government incentives.","President Trump on Wednesday threw the weight of the federal government behind vehicles that burn gasoline rather than electric cars, gutting one of the country’s most significant efforts to address climate change and thrusting the automobile industry into greater uncertainty.

Flanked by executives from major automakers in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the Transportation Department would significantly weaken fuel efficiency requirements for tens of millions of new cars and light trucks. The administration claimed the changes would save Americans $109 billion over five years and shave $1,000 off the average cost of a new car.

The Biden administration’s stricter efficiency standards were designed to get more Americans to go electric. But Mr. Trump said they “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices, and made the car much worse. This is a green new scam, and people were paying too much for a car that didn’t work as well.”

For the past half-century, the efficiency standards have compelled automakers to increase the distance their vehicles can travel on a gallon of gas, reducing fuel consumption and leading to innovations like electric and hybrid cars.

The announcement on Wednesday was the second part of a one-two punch against policies promoting electric cars, a central pillar of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s strategy for fighting climate change.

Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the United States, and Mr. Biden had adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to reducing these emissions. He offered tax credits to encourage motorists to buy electric cars while requiring that automakers meet stringent fuel efficiency standards to pressure them to sell more nonpolluting models.

Mr. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress got rid of the tax credits earlier this year. They also eliminated fines for automakers who violate the fuel efficiency standards. And now the standards themselves will be watered down.

While auto executives publicly praised the announcement, they have privately fretted that they are being buffeted by conflicting federal policies. During the Biden administration, they invested billions of dollars and reoriented their manufacturing to produce electric vehicles and batteries.

Now the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and imported car parts have lopped billions of dollars from carmakers’ bottom lines while disrupting supply chains. Inflation has also made it difficult for many people to afford new cars.

The Biden administration rule, finalized in June 2024, assumed that manufacturers would comply by increasing their sales of electric vehicles, which use no gasoline and would help boost the average fuel efficiency across their product lines. Biden administration officials estimated that the rule would lower fuel costs by $23 billion while preventing more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2050, the equivalent of taking 165 million cars off the roads for one year.

Mr. Trump, who refers to climate change as a “hoax,” initially promised to repeal the rules to end what he falsely called an “E.V. mandate.” But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was motivated to weaken the rules in order to lower the price of new cars. The cost of living has emerged as major concern for voters and a political vulnerability for the president and his party.

“Perhaps grudgingly, the president is increasingly realizing that inflation, affordability, the economy are real concerns across the partisan spectrum,” said Barry Rabe, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan.

Left unsaid on Wednesday was the fact that analysts expect the president’s tariffs on cars and car parts to increase the price of automobiles built abroad. The average price of a new car in the United States has now exceeded $50,000 for the first time, according to Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. It attributed the increase to tariffs as well as low loan rates and new electric vehicle sales.

Mr. Trump has aggressively repealed dozens of federal climate protections. The rollback of automobile standards comes as the administration is also lifting restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and oil and gas wells while making it easier for fossil fuel companies to extract and burn more coal, oil and gas, the main drivers of climate change.

Several Republican officials applauded the move. “President Trump won the argument over E.V. mandates on Election Day,” said Russell Coleman, the attorney general of Kentucky who led a lawsuit against the Biden administration. “As a result, Kentuckians can continue relying on our gas-powered trucks, cars and vans.”

Automakers were more circumspect. John Bozzella, the chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a lobbying group for most major carmakers, said the organization was still reviewing the Trump plan. But, he said, the Biden-era standards were “extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for E.V.s.”

Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said on Wednesday that her company would continue to seek “significant improvement from a fuel economy perspective,” regardless of the federal rules. She said people should buy electric cars based on their merits, not because of government incentives. “People choose an E.V. because it’s a better performance vehicle and it fits their life,” Ms. Barra said at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit before the White House announcement.

The new policy frees automakers to sell more pickups and sport utility vehicles, which are usually much more profitable than smaller cars. It will be difficult for carmakers to resist pressure to sell these gas guzzlers, despite Ms. Barra’s pledge to keep making fuel-efficient vehicles.

Car sales in the United States are stagnant, and the difficult environment is prompting automakers to “really take a hard look at their portfolio and where they make profit,” said Lenny LaRocca, who leads the automotive practice at consulting firm KPMG. “I would anticipate that more focus would be on the larger S.U.V.’s and pickup trucks.”

But carmakers who neglect smaller cars and electric vehicles could be vulnerable if there is an oil price shock that drives up gasoline prices. They could have trouble competing if people become more concerned about fuel economy.

“There is a market for those vehicles,” Mr. LaRocca said, referring to smaller cars. “The question is going to be, do they want to compete long term in that market?”

The changes also push the United States further out of sync with the rest of the world, where the electric vehicle market is growing, making it harder for companies to design vehicles that they can sell anywhere, said Stuart Taylor, a former Ford executive who is chief product officer at Envorso, a consulting firm that helps companies with digital technology. “The migration to E.V.s, which most of us in the industry believe is inevitable, is now running on two different timelines,” Mr. Taylor said.

Vehicles on average got only about 13 miles to the gallon, so Congress passed what became the fuel economy standards as an energy security measure. “It was really to reduce oil dependence. That’s the heart of why it started,” said Rebecca Ciez, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University.

The standards remained somewhat stagnant for many years, and popular, until President Barack Obama sought to dramatically tighten them. Linking mileage standards to the effort to fight climate change also politicized and “drew fire” to the policy, Ms. Ciez said.

Economists said repealing Biden-era mileage standards may indeed lower production costs, but only marginally, and at a price to public health and the environment. And in the long run, many noted, Americans will pay more in gasoline prices than they would have otherwise.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/03/multimedia/03cli-fuel-efficiency-01-fhlw/03cli-fuel-efficiency-01-fhlw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:03:39.337391

TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said the U.S.-China energy announcement is a meaningful but not necessarily transformative development for American LNG.
“For the broader U.S. LNG industry this is a clear positive,” Longanecker said from Austin.
“None of this points to materially higher exports of U.S. LNG to China.
“New projects continue to add to the ability to get Permian gas to market, though this game of catch-up continues to keep prices for Permian gas muted relative to Henry Hub and other benchmarks,” he said.","Energy experts say the full value of China’s Oct. 29 agreement with President Trump to start the process of buying American oil and gas, possibly including a large-scale transaction from Alaska, is not yet known, but it is nonetheless a positive for the American energy industry.

The Permian Basin Petroleum Association, the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association and Amarillo economist Karr Ingham are encouraged.

“From our vantage point any deal that enhances U.S. liquefied natural gas export markets is a signal that global demand for American natural gas remains robust,” PBPA President Ben Shepperd said. “Combined with existing demand in Europe and Asia, additional LNG export partners help reinforce the strategic importance of the Permian Basin as both an oil and natural gas producing region.

“There are a number of infrastructure projects in the queue that will be helping abate the takeaway constraints that have been impacting production in the Basin, but as pipeline takeaway capacity improves and Gulf Coast LNG export and domestic markets grow, we believe the Basin will play a critical role in supplying those markets while relieving regional oversupply pressures.”

He said success as always ultimately depends on matching production growth with adequate midstream and export infrastructure and staying alert to shifts in global demand and regulatory dynamics.

TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said the U.S.-China energy announcement is a meaningful but not necessarily transformative development for American LNG.

“China’s commitment to resume and expand purchases removes the 15% retaliatory tariff that effectively shut U.S. molecules out of the world’s largest LNG import market for most of 2025 and it re-opens a key demand center at a time when Europe is already saturated,” he said. “While the exact volumes remain to be negotiated, even a return to pre-trade war levels plus modest growth would add several billion dollars in annual export revenue and more importantly provide diversification away from an increasingly price-sensitive European spot market.

“For the broader U.S. LNG industry this is a clear positive,” Longanecker said from Austin. “It improves the bankability of the next wave of projects, the CP2 export terminal in Louisiana, Golden Pass, Port Arthur, etc., and lifts the outlook for Henry Hub prices in 2026–2028.

“The bigger story, however, remains with domestic infrastructure. The Permian gas glut that drove Waha Hub into negative territory repeatedly in 2024–2025 is finally being addressed by the largest pipeline buildout in Texas since the shale boom began.”

Longanecker said Matterhorn Express Pipeline with 2.5 billion cubic feet per day online this month plus expansions on the Permian Highway, Gulf Coast Express, Whistler and several other pipelines will add roughly 12 Bcf/d of takeaway capacity out of West Texas by 2027.

“That is more than enough to clear the current bottleneck, stabilize Basin pricing and fully supply the seven operating Gulf Coast LNG export terminals plus the four under construction.”

He said Texas, which already produces 45% of U.S. natural gas and hosts about 40% of current U.S. LNG export capacity, will be the primary beneficiary.

“Higher associated gas volumes from the Permian can now move efficiently to waterborne markets instead of being flared or shut in, supporting both producer economics and the state’s midstream and export complex,” Longanecker said. “In short the China deal is a welcome tailwind, but the heavy lifting for the American LNG boom and the relief of the West Texas glut is being done by steel in the ground across the Lone Star State.”

Ingham, president of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, said the jury is still out on the U.S.-China deal.

“Obviously every molecule of American LNG sold is a win for American and Texas producers and exporters, but China purchased no LNG in 2025 until a paltry 546 million cubic feet in September with no numbers yet being available October or November,” Ingham said.

“Perhaps they are on the path to restoring some meaningful volume of imported U.S. LNG, but even that wouldn’t suggest a huge market mover at least at the moment.

“China accounted for less than 5% of all U.S. LNG exported in 2024 and less than 3% of all U.S. natural gas exports including LNG and pipelines and they are not poised to return even to those levels in 2026.”

Ingham said American tariffs and then Chinese retaliatory and reciprocal tariffs accounted for the loss of LNG exports to China in 2025 and LNG import demand has softened across the board in China as well.

“In addition China has been replacing some LNG imports with pipeline gas from Russia via Siberia,” he said. “None of this points to materially higher exports of U.S. LNG to China.

“We may gradually replace some of the lost volumes this year as they might not be zero in the coming month and in 2026, but there is nothing that points to a significant demand increase from China alone in the near term.”

Ingham noted that pipeline development and construction continue for the purpose of getting gas out of the Permian Basin and to Gulf Coast markets.

“New projects continue to add to the ability to get Permian gas to market, though this game of catch-up continues to keep prices for Permian gas muted relative to Henry Hub and other benchmarks,” he said. At the Henry Hub today the price is $4.59, but at the Waha Hub it’s 13 cents.

“I’m sure we all look forward to the day when Permian-produced natural gas finally gets its due in the marketplace because that has not been the case for a long time and it is not the case at present,” Ingham said. “This is a fantastic resource and though its production is tied to crude oil to a huge extent, it has much greater value to Texas, the U.S. and the world than is being reflected in its price.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/091421__oil_art_12-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:04:26.885918

President Donald Trump unveiled his administration’s plan to relax stringent Biden-era fuel efficiency standards, casting the change as a way to lower consumer costs.

“Today my administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs and make buying a car much more affordable for countless American families — and also safer,” Trump said in an Oval Office event Dec. 3 with representatives from Detroit’s major automakers.

Trump was joined in the Oval by Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa, Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley and John Urbanic, plant manager at General Motors Co.’s Orion, Mich., facility.

The Transportation Department proposal, which still must go through a formal rulemaking process and could be finalized next year, represents the administration’s latest bid to unwind a suite of policies spurring electric vehicle production that Trump has derided as an “EV mandate.”

At issue are corporate average fuel economy requirements for cars and light trucks that were tightened under former President Joe Biden. Under those Biden-era standards, automakers must achieve an average of about 50 miles per gallon across their 2031 model-year vehicles.

But the new Trump administration proposal would lower that requirement to about 34.5 mpg for the 2031 model year. The measure also would eliminate a credit-trading program used by automakers to comply with the requirements, starting with the 2028 model year.

Trump’s proposal represents a major win for the auto and oil industries that complained the requirements pushed the bounds of available technology for getting more miles out of each gallon of gasoline, effectively discouraging the sale of traditional gas-fueled combustion engines in favor of emission-free electric models. Automakers had been expected to sell more electric vehicles to help hit the fuel-efficiency targets charted under Biden, as well as related federal limits on tailpipe pollution.

Critics said the proposal will encourage U.S. automakers to produce less-efficient gas guzzlers, narrowing consumer choice.

Trump already signed legislation lifting penalties on automakers that fail to fulfill the fuel economy standards and ending a consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. His Environmental Protection Agency also has proposed repealing limits on the greenhouse gas emissions from cars, pickups and heavy-duty trucks.

Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa said the Jeep-maker welcomed the change that would realign U.S. fuel economy standards “with real-world market conditions.”

“We look forward to working further with NHTSA on environmentally responsible policies that also allow us to offer our customers the freedom to choose the vehicles they want at prices they can afford,” he said in an emailed statement, referring to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Affordability Push

Trump’s announcement comes as the administration looks to counter cost-of-living fears, with higher prices for consumer goods, electricity and some imports stoking concern about the president’s stewardship of the economy and raising political risks for Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

New car prices topped $50,000 on average for the first time in September, climbing as domestic automakers prioritize profitable high-end, feature-laden models over lower-margin, entry-level cars.

The Trump administration said its proposal would save Americans $109 billion over the next five years. Families could see savings of $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle, according to the administration’s projections.

The Biden-era plan “twisted mileage standards to create an electric vehicle mandate — jacking up car prices for American families and forcing manufacturers to produce vehicles no one wanted,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Although the Trump administration is casting the fuel economy change as an economic windfall, environmentalists say it will translate into added gasoline costs for American families. A retreat from the Biden-era standards that effectively lowered average fuel needs, they say, puts Americans on the hook to buy more gasoline.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)

“This isn’t about saving money for drivers or automakers — it’s about boosting oil companies’ profits,” said Kathy Harris, a director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Turning back the clock on even just three years of fuel economy progress means that drivers pay thousands more at the gas pump over the lifetime of their vehicles.”

The standards being targeted by Trump were predicted to have cut gasoline consumption by almost 70 billion gallons through 2050 and, according to the Biden administration, would save U.S. consumers more than $23 billion in fuel costs. That would translate to about $600 in savings over an individual vehicle’s lifetime.

Still, gasoline prices have fallen during Trump’s second term, down to $2.99 per gallon of unleaded on Tuesday, according to AAA, from $3.13 Jan. 20, when he took office. Trump has touted those falling fuel costs as an economic victory.

Trump ordered the elimination of subsidies and other measures boosting electric vehicles hours after taking office. Duffy also swiftly directed the NHTSA to rewrite the existing fuel economy standards, arguing they are “artificially high” and inconsistent with Trump’s policy to promote the production, distribution and use of domestic oil, natural gas and biofuels.

To justify the change, NHTSA has argued the Biden-era standards improperly included battery-electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles when dictating future fleet requirements.

Environmentalists say the proposal flouts a requirement under federal law for corporate average fuel efficiency standards to be set at the “maximum feasible” level.

Elon Musk stated that rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could make traditional work unnecessary within two decades.","General Motors CEO Mary Barra said in a new interview on Wednesday that she told President Joe Biden to credit Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, for the widespread electric vehicle transition.

She said she told Biden this after the former President credited her and GM for leading EV efforts in the United States.

During an interview at the New York Times Dealbook Summit with Andrew Ross Sorkin, Barra said she told Biden that crediting her was essentially a mistake, and that Musk and Tesla should have been explicitly mentioned (via Business Insider):

“He was crediting me, and I said, ‘Actually, I think a lot of that credit goes to Elon and Tesla…You know me, Andrew. I don’t want to take credit for things.”

Back in 2021, President Biden visited GM’s “Factory Zero” plant in Detroit, which was the centerpiece of the company’s massive transition to EVs. The former President went on to discuss the EV industry, and claimed that GM and Barra were the true leaders who caused the change:

“In the auto industry, Detroit is leading the world in electric vehicles. You know how critical it is? Mary, I remember talking to you way back in January about the need for America to lead in electric vehicles. I can remember your dramatic announcement that by 2035, GM would be 100% electric. You changed the whole story, Mary. You did, Mary. You electrified the entire automotive industry. I’m serious. You led, and it matters.”

People were baffled by the President’s decision to highlight GM and Barra, and not Tesla and Musk, who truly started the transition to EVs. GM, Ford, and many other companies only followed in the footsteps of Tesla after it started to take market share from them.

Musk would eventually go on to talk about Biden’s words later on:

“They have so much power over the White House that they can exclude Tesla from an EV Summit. And, in case the first thing, in case that wasn’t enough, then you have President Biden with Mary Barra at a subsequent event, congratulating Mary for having led the EV revolution.”

In Q4 2021, which was shortly after Biden’s comments, Tesla delivered 300,000 EVs. GM delivered just 26.

Tesla Optimus showed off its newest capability as progress on the project continues to accelerate toward an ultimate goal of mass production in the coming years.

Tesla is still developing Optimus and preparing for the first stages of mass production, where units would be sold and shipped to customers. CEO Elon Musk has always marketed the humanoid robot as the biggest product in history, even outside of Tesla, but of all time.

He believes it will eliminate the need to manually perform monotonous tasks, like cleaning, mowing the lawn, and folding laundry.

However, lately, Musk has revealed even bigger plans for Optimus, including the ability to relieve humans of work entirely within the next 20 years.

Development at Tesla’s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics teams has progressed, and a new video was shown of the robot taking a light jog with what appeared to be some pretty natural form:

Optimus has also made several public appearances lately, including one at the Neural Information Processing Systems, or NeurIPS Conference. Some spectators shared videos of Optimus’s charging rig, as well as its movements and capabilities, most interestingly, the hand:

The hand, forearm, and fingers have been one of the most evident challenges for Tesla in recent times, especially as it continues to work on its 3rd Generation iteration of Optimus.

Musk said during the Q3 Earnings Call:

“I don’t want to downplay the difficulty, but it’s an incredibly difficult thing, especially to create a hand that is as dexterous and capable as the human hand, which is incredible. The human hand is an incredible thing. The more you study the human hand, the more incredible you realize it is, and why you need four fingers and a thumb, why the fingers have certain degrees of freedom, why the various muscles are of different strengths, and fingers are of different lengths. It turns out that those are all there for a reason.”

The interesting part of the Optimus program so far is the fact that Tesla has made a lot of progress with other portions of the project, like movement, for example, which appears to have come a long way.

However, without a functional hand and fingers, Optimus could be rendered relatively useless, so it is evident that it has to figure this crucial part out first.

Elon Musk said in late November that he’s “tried to warn” legacy automakers and “even offered to license Tesla Full Self-Driving, but they don’t want it,” expressing frustration with companies that refuse to adopt the company’s suite, which will eventually be autonomous.

Tesla has long established itself as the leader in self-driving technology, especially in the United States. Although there are formidable competitors, Tesla’s FSD suite is the most robust and is not limited to certain areas or roadways. It operates anywhere and everywhere.

The company’s current position as the leader in self-driving tech is being ignored by legacy automakers, a parallel to what Tesla’s position was with EV development over a decade ago, which was also ignored by competitors.

The reluctance mirrors how legacy automakers initially dismissed EVs, only to scramble in catch-up mode years later–a pattern that highlights their historical underestimation of disruptive innovations from Tesla.

Elon Musk’s Self-Driving Licensing Attempts

Musk and Tesla have tried to push Full Self-Driving to other car companies, with no true suitors, despite ongoing conversations for years. Tesla’s FSD is aiming to become more robust through comprehensive data collection and a larger fleet, something the company has tried to establish through a subscription program, free trials, and other strategies.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sends rivals dire warning about Full Self-Driving

However, competing companies have not wanted to license FSD for a handful of speculative reasons: competitive pride, regulatory concerns, high costs, or preference for in-house development.

Déjà vu All Over Again

Tesla tried to portray the importance of EVs long ago, as in the 2010s, executives from companies like Ford and GM downplayed the importance of sustainable powertrains as niche or unprofitable.

Musk once said in a 2014 interview that rivals woke up to electric powertrains when the Model S started to disrupt things and gained some market share. Things got really serious upon the launch of the Model 3 in 2017, as a mass-market vehicle was what Tesla was missing from its lineup.

This caused legacy companies to truly wake up; they were losing market share to Tesla’s new and exciting tech that offered less maintenance, a fresh take on passenger auto, and other advantages. They were late to the party, and although they have all launched vehicles of their own, they still lag in two major areas: sales and infrastructure, leaning on Tesla for the latter.

Musk’s past warnings have been plentiful. In 2017, he responded to critics who stated Tesla was chasing subsidies. He responded, “Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 and then crushed them in a junkyard,” adding that “they would be doing nothing” on EVs without Tesla’s efforts.

Companies laughed off Tesla’s prowess with EVs, only to realize they had made a grave mistake later on.

It looks to be happening once again.

A Pattern of Underestimation

Both EVs and self-driving tech represent major paradigm shifts that legacy players view as threats to their established business models; it’s hard to change. However, these early push-aways from new tech only result in reactive strategies later on, usually resulting in what pains they are facing now.

Ford is scaling back its EV efforts, and GM’s projects are hurting. Although they both have in-house self-driving projects, they are falling well behind the progress of Tesla and even other competitors.

It is getting to a point where short-term risk will become a long-term setback, and they may have to rely on a company to pull them out of a tough situation later on, just as it did with Tesla and EV charging infrastructure.

Tesla has continued to innovate, while legacy automakers have lagged behind, and it has cost them dearly.

Implications and Future Outlook

Moving forward, Tesla’s progress will continue to accelerate, while a dismissive attitude by other companies will continue to penalize them, especially as time goes on. Falling further behind in self-driving could eventually lead to market share erosion, as autonomy could be a crucial part of vehicle marketing within the next few years.

Eventually, companies could be forced into joint partnerships as economic pressures mount. Some companies did this with EVs, but it has not resulted in very much.

Self-driving efforts are not only a strength for companies themselves, but they also contribute to other things, like affordability and safety.

Tesla has exhibited data that specifically shows its self-driving tech is safer than human drivers, most recently by a considerable margin. This would help with eliminating accidents and making roads safer.

Additionally, competition in the market is a good thing, as it drives costs down and helps innovation continue on an upward trend.

Conclusion

The parallels are unmistakable: a decade ago, legacy automakers laughed off electric vehicles as toys for tree-huggers, crushed their own EV programs, and bet everything on the internal-combustion status quo–only to watch Tesla redefine the industry while they scrambled for billions in catch-up capital.

Today, the same companies are turning down repeated offers to license Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology, insisting they can build better autonomy in-house, even as their own programs stumble through recalls, layoffs, and missed milestones. History is not merely rhyming; it is repeating almost note-for-note.

Elon Musk has spent twenty years warning that the auto industry’s bureaucratic inertia and short-term thinking will leave it stranded on the wrong side of technological revolutions. The question is no longer whether Tesla is ahead–it is whether the giants of Detroit, Stuttgart, and Toyota will finally listen before the next wave leaves them watching another leader pull away in the rear-view mirror.

This time, the stakes are not just market share; they are the very definition of what a car will be in the decades ahead.

Elon Musk stated that rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could make traditional work unnecessary within two decades.

Speaking on entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath’s podcast, Musk predicted that machines will soon handle most forms of labor, leaving humans to work only if they choose to.

Work as a “hobby”

During the discussion, Musk said the accelerating capability of AI systems and general-purpose robots will eventually cover all essential tasks, making human labor a choice rather than an economic requirement. “In less than 20 years, working will be optional. Working at all will be optional. Like a hobby,” Musk said.

When Kamath asked whether this future is driven by massive productivity growth, Musk agreed, noting that people will still be free to work if they enjoy the routine or the challenge. He compared future employment to home gardening, as it is something people can still do for personal satisfaction even if buying food from a store is far easier.

“Optional” work in the future

Elon Musk acknowledged the boldness of his claim and joked that people might look back in 20 years and say he was wrong. That being said, the CEO noted that such a scenario could even happen sooner than his prediction, at least if one were to consider the pace of the advancements in AI and robotics.

“Obviously people can play this back in 20 years and say, ‘Look, Elon made this ridiculous prediction and it’s not true,’ but I think it will turn out to be true, that in less than 20 years, maybe even as little as ten or 15 years, the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional,” Musk said.

Elon Musk’s comments echo his previous sentiments at Tesla’s 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting, where he noted that Optimus could ultimately eliminate poverty. He also noted that robots like Optimus could eventually provide people worldwide with the best medical care.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mary-barra-elon-musk-tesla-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:04:18.651456

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,’' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

‘People want the gasoline car’

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats’ efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,’' said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. “We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.

Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.

The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.

The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,"" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.

Rules would sharply lower mileage standard

If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.

On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were ""completely unattainable"" for automakers. He initially directed NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.

The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.

NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. ""Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,"" he said in a statement.

Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives. In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards ""with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.""

General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.

""GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,"" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.

The fuel economy proposal would roll back a rule finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.

At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.

The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.

Would new MPG rules ease car prices?

CarEdge CEO Zach Shefka described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.

If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, ""It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.""

The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.

""Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/03/1d0f2fc1-693c-4769-8b78-4c32e0856ef7/thumbnail/1200x630/2067cfd9e31e4bc990e1801cbd48d047/gettyimages-2248020840.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 18:03:38.589687

“Our members are the professionals who will make clean heating work on the ground.
With the right support and a fair approach to costs, the UK can deliver both a green transition and a just one.”","Federation says recognition of plumbing and heating engineers is vital, but affordability and clarity on energy pricing remain key

The Plumbing and Heating Federation (SNIPEF) has welcomed the UK Government’s announcement of a UK-wide clean energy jobs plan (19 October), describing it as an important and positive move that finally recognises the essential role of plumbing and heating engineers in delivering clean energy systems.

SNIPEF said the announcement rightly celebrates the professional trades who will install, maintain and decommission the low-carbon systems that make clean energy possible in homes and businesses.

However, the Federation cautioned that affordability must remain central to the green transition. The call comes after the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged the Government to reconsider its target to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030, warning that the rush to build new renewable capacity could push up energy costs and strain supply chains. The Institute argued that clean power must be affordable power if it is to deliver both economic growth and public support.

Fiona Hodgson, Chief Executive of SNIPEF, said: “We fully support the Government’s ambition to build a cleaner, more secure energy future and we are pleased that this announcement recognises the vital contribution of plumbers and heating engineers.

“Too often, the focus is on infrastructure and large projects, when in fact it is our skilled tradespeople who bring these technologies to life in people’s homes and communities.

“Our recent letter to the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP, raised the same concern now being discussed by the Tony Blair Institute. Electricity prices remain disproportionately high compared with gas, which discourages households from switching to low-carbon heating. The green transition is essential, but it must not add to cost-of-living pressures or undermine consumer confidence.”

SNIPEF said it stands ready to work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to create a clear pathway that addresses price imbalances, supports skills and training, and ensures that the transition to clean energy remains both affordable and achievable for households across the UK.

“This is a moment to bring policy ambition and practical delivery together,” Hodgson added. “Our members are the professionals who will make clean heating work on the ground. With the right support and a fair approach to costs, the UK can deliver both a green transition and a just one.”",https://ethicalmarketingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-twitter-logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:03:45.285506

The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Trump announced the plan at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers, who have praised the planned changes. The auto industry has complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real world market conditions.”

Environmentalists decried the decision.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and more 4,870 tons a year of smog components nitrogen oxide volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas.
We must ensure continued reductions in haze pollution in the years and decades to come to benefit these treasured places and our communities.","Dear Ms. Wantlin:

On behalf of our millions of members and supporters nationwide, we write to share comments on the open regulatory docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-1477, Visibility Protection: Regional Haze State Plan Requirements Rule Revision. We strongly urge the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that any revisions or changes to the Regional Haze Rule safeguard: 1) the Rule’s primary goal to reduce visibility impairing pollution in Class I areas and 2) the requirement for states to make continued, reasonable progress toward natural visibility in Class I areas. We are concerned the EPA is headed in a direction that will run contrary to the visibility goals of the Clean Air Act, weaken the Regional Haze Rule and undermine years of consistent agency interpretation and progress toward cleaner air in parks and wilderness areas.

From coast to coast, national parks and wilderness areas protect and conserve the country’s most unique and diverse landscapes, wildlife habitats, cultural resources and ecosystems. From the soaring peaks in Rocky Mountain National Park to the swamp of Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, to the high desert of Joshua Tree National Park to the stunning vistas at Dolly Sods Wilderness Area, Class I areas around the country attract visitors from all over the world to enjoy their splendor. These areas also safeguard our country’s stories and cultural resources, educating visitors on our shared history. But apart from their value to our national story, these landscapes preserve an invaluable asset to the thriving tourism and outdoor recreation public lands economy. The future of these places depends on healthy ecosystems and positive visitor experiences. In 2023 alone, outdoor recreation added over $639 billion to the national economy and supported nearly 5 million jobs.

While most air pollution doesn’t originate in our beloved national parks or wilderness areas, it can travel hundreds of miles from its original source, affecting parks and communities near and far. Air pollution from coal plants, oil and gas development, chemical and plastics manufacturers, pulp and paper mills, vehicles, and other industrial facilities, is one of the most serious threats facing national parks, threatening the health of park visitors, wildlife, and neighboring communities, compromising our views with hazy skies and driving the climate crisis.

The Regional Haze Rule is a time-tested, effective program that requires federal and state agencies, federal land managers and stakeholders to work together to restore clear skies in 156 national parks and wilderness areas (Class I areas). The Haze Rule has delivered significant cost-effective clean air benefits to national parks, wilderness areas and communities across the nation in the past 15 years—over 1.4 million tons of visibility impairing pollution has been reduced, improving scenic views and making air healthier to breathe across the nation. In places like Great Smoky Mountains National Park, visibility has increased by nearly 40 miles from haze pollution reductions. But there is still a lot of work to do as visitors regularly miss out on over 50 miles of scenic views and experience unhealthy air when visiting these treasured places.

According to National Parks Conservation Association’s Polluted Parks 2024 analysis, 97% of national parks continue to suffer from unsatisfactory levels of hazy skies, indicating they are far from achieving naturally clean air. And since air pollution knows no boundaries, communities across the country are negatively affected by the same air pollution that harms Class I areas. Air pollution causes illnesses, drives up healthcare costs, and has harmful and disproportionate consequences on communities of color and low-income communities that often live closest to the polluting sources and already face chronic environmental injustices.

While EPA’s Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) outlines three broad topic areas, our comments are overarching in nature. Overall, we urge EPA to abandon many of the noted “alternative approaches” as they run contrary to the text and purpose of the Clean Air Act and EPA’s prior interpretations of the Act’s regional haze requirements. Additionally, the “alternative approaches” could drastically modify the essential elements of the Regional Haze Rule. We reject any efforts by EPA that would weaken the effectiveness of the program by:

Allowing states to evade installing cost effective controls to clean up controllable park-harming pollution and to claim that no pollution reductions are necessary.

Eliminating requirements for states to develop regular and much-needed regional haze plans to identify how they will advance their state toward air quality improvements to benefit parks and wilderness areas with the goal of restoring natural visibility.

Allowing states to avoid identifying necessary emission reduction measures based on the four reasonable progress factors set forth by Congress.

Allowing states to claim that past achievements in visibility impairment or emissions reductions are sufficient for satisfying current obligations.

If EPA pursues revisions to the Regional Haze Rule, we offer the following recommendations to ensure that states, decisionmakers and industrial facilities that emit haze pollutants are held accountable to the national, bipartisan goal of achieving natural visibility in Class I areas:

Requiring all dominant pollutants (NOx, SO2 and PM) that contribute to haze and visibility impairment are assessed in haze plans. Previously, states have been allowed to focus only on one dominant pollutant and have skipped analysis of others, even when controlling other pollutants could be cost effective and demonstrably improve visibility in parks and wilderness areas.

Clarifying that a Class I area’s Uniform Rate of Progress (URP) glidepath is not a safe harbor against further reasonable progress, meaning that states cannot declare victory before the end goal of natural visibility is achieved. Amidst additional easing of other air pollution regulations by this administration, we believe states must still analyze available control measures to reduce emissions from in-state facilities; they cannot reject controls that are reasonable just because Class I areas impacted by that state’s pollution were previously projected to be at or below their URP glidepaths.

Clarifying and providing clear direction on source selection and evaluation by states. In previous planning periods, states have failed to evaluate all haze pollution sources, including mobile and area sources, which allows for some sectors and facilities to be left off the hook for cleaning up their emissions.

Improve and strengthen state-to-state consultation requirements and Federal Land Manager consultation requirements to ensure feedback is meaningfully addressed.

Protect and maintain comprehensive air monitoring and scientifically sound, best practices for measuring haze impairment that are the essential foundations for tracking visibility improvement. Ensure that consistent, short- and long-term air pollution data gathering is maintained to safeguard park visitors and staff.

Although progress has been made in many Class I areas around the country, no Class I area has achieved the goal of natural visibility and we cannot allow good momentum to be halted. Furthermore, many sources of air pollution that were expected to retire, clean up or otherwise reduce emissions can no longer be assumed to be on that same course given dramatic changes in the last year to clean air policies, facility or pollution control operations and pollution exemptions granted by presidential decree.

Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas. We must ensure continued reductions in haze pollution in the years and decades to come to benefit these treasured places and our communities.

Thank you for considering our comments.

Yet, Hyundai maintains its electrification strategy, which already spans HEV, PHEV, and BEV models, and will soon include Extended-Range Electric Vehicles (EREV), was never dependent on government whims.

As Olabisi Boyle, Senior VP of Product Planning for Hyundai Motor North America, candidly stated: “Our EV strategy was never based on current politics… We were building an EV plant and had the E-GMP platform before the IRA”.

While Boyle confirms that EV sales did slump in November 2025 compared to the frenzy of 2024, she urges critical thinking. She argues that massive October sales, like the Ioniq 5‘s best-ever month of 8,408 units, were driven artificially high by customers rushing to grab the credit before it expired. Year-To-Date figures tell a different story. The Ioniq 5 is up 12% over 2024. EV sales aren’t cratering; they are simply stabilizing after the government’s free-money hangover.

Hyundai was prepared for this pivot, immediately announcing deep price cuts on the Ioniq 5, in some trims, exceeding the former $7,500 federal handout, sometimes reaching $9,800. This aggressive move was intentional, designed to appeal to the “middle of the adoption curve”, the consumers who prioritize affordability and ease of use over bleeding-edge status. Boyle explained that Hyundai works backward with R&D, setting a target price point for years out, and adjusts material costs and options to meet it.

Beyond affordability, the infrastructure gap remains the next great hurdle. Hyundai’s solution? EREVs. This tech, where a gasoline engine acts purely as a generator, solves the consumer’s chief complaint: range anxiety. “People like to hear ‘I can get 600 miles of range.’ With the EREV, you can get that”, Boyle explained. This is especially relevant for large vehicles like the newly announced mid-size pickup truck, where an all-electric solution is harder to sell for customers who need maximum towing and distance.",https://www.clubalfa.it/en/assets/media/2025/12/result_2025-ioniq-5.webp,N,,2025-12-03 17:04:22.461715

Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.

But Trump’s second term may be different.

A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods – not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive – through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farmworkers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.

In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018–19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic – at least in the short term.

Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper – and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.

Tariffs: The familiar pain returns

The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.

An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.

Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.

Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.

In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.

Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs

Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.

Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program – a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.

As exports collapsed in late September, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink – forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.

Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock

The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina – supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.

The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets – a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.

Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat

For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs – crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance – which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.

Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.

That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.

For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.

The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.

Politics: How deep does loyalty run?

As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies – and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.

Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss – or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.

No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.

If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith – and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.

We look forward to welcoming additional partners and helping communities across Illinois recover and recycle hundreds of thousands of gallons of leftover paint.""","A program operated by PaintCare Inc. in Illinois that started early this month has been designed to recover and recycle or repurpose leftover paint generated by homeowners and small businesses.

According to PaintCare, the new recycling program enables households and businesses to recycle leftover paint, stain and varnish through an expected collection network of more than 250 drop-off sites in the state.

PaintCare, a Washington-based nonprofit organization created by paint companies that comprise the membership of the American Coatings Association (ACA), says the program relies on partnerships with paint and hardware retail stores and local government facilities.

""We're excited to bring PaintCare to Illinois, giving families and businesses, easy, year-round options for recycling leftover paint,"" says Michael W. Johnson, CEO of the ACA. ""Our goal is to make it easy and convenient to 'recycle the rest,' creating a responsible solution for our industry that benefits everyone who uses paint and the environment.""

The paint recycling program is a response to a paint stewardship law that was passed unopposed by the Illinois Legislature and signed into law by Gov. JB Pritzker in 2023.

Under this law, paint manufacturers are required to develop and implement a cost-effective paint stewardship program that will reduce the generation of leftover paint, promote paint reuse and recycling, and manage the postconsumer paint waste stream using environmentally sound management practices. Oversight for the program will be provided by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

""The launch of the PaintCare program represents an important step forward in expanding crucial recycling options for Illinois households and businesses,"" Illinois EPA Director James Jennings says.

PaintCare's Illinois program follows similar paint stewardship laws and programs in California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Oregon, Vermont and the state of Washington, plus a program that is being developed for Maryland.

Its sites accept both latex and oil-based paint products, including interior and exterior paints, primers, stains, sealers and varnishes. Paint must be dropped off in its original container with its original manufacturer's label.

""Illinois paint and hardware retailers, along with local government facilities, are essential partners in this effort,"" says Ross Dudzik, Illinois Program Manager for PaintCare. “Their willingness to volunteer space and serve as convenient drop-off locations is truly the backbone of this program.

Empire State Development today announced Natrion, a producer of innovative battery components for electric vehicles, energy storage, and defense applications, has selected 575 Ludwig Avenue in Cheektowaga as the location for its new production facility. The start-up specializes in rechargeable lithium and sodium battery technology. The project supports the broader New Energy New York initiative, whose goal is to create a National Hub for Battery Innovation and Manufacturing.

""It is critical for New York State to play a leading role in the research and development of advanced, cutting-edge, and innovative energy technologies. The United States and the world are seeing unprecedented demand for safe and economic energy storage for electric vehicles and grid modernization, which must be sourced using the most resilient and sustainable supply chains,” said Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight. “We are proud to welcome Natrion to New York's growing cluster of companies focused on the clean energy transition and reducing climate change.”

Natrion is a leading battery material pioneer developing the intellectual property and components needed to secure future clean energy goals. Started in 2018, the company produces Active Separator, an advanced solid-state electrolyte separator made from a material called Lithium Solid Ionic Composite (LISIC) that is designed to enhance the performance, safety, and lifespan of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The flagship Active Separator offering has received various industry awards for its innovative design as well as numerous Department of Defense contracts. While headquartered in Binghamton, New York, Natrion will be establishing its global manufacturing center in a new facility in Cheektowaga to increase Active Separator production capacity 40-fold. At full utilization, the new site is anticipated to be capable of supplying the equivalent of approximately 11,000 electric vehicles annually.

As a longstanding partner to the U.S. Department of Defense, Natrion has also secured capabilities to produce its Gen-1 Active Separator material entirely in the U.S. with only domestic materials. The company's supply chain is fully insulated from tariff interruptions, making it ideal for manufacturers seeking IRA-compliant American-made components.

Natrion CEO and founder Alex Kosyakov said, “We have already successfully initiated commercial-scale production at the Cheektowaga site and are making tremendous progress in getting the Cheektowaga site up and running at full operation throughout. Our team is immensely grateful for the level of support that has been brought to bear by NY State. We quickly understood that the wealth of innovation and manufacturing talent and resources available in Western NY made it the best place for us to locate and grow our production operations. Our aims now are to secure the US battery supply chain with on shored componentry and contribute to local workforce development and job creation.”

Empire State Development (ESD) is assisting the project with up to $250,000 through the performance-based Excelsior Jobs Tax Credit Program to support Natrion’s creation of 19 new jobs over the course of five years. Natrion also recently received a $1.5 million investment through New York Ventures as part of the company’s recent capital raise. ESD’s New York Ventures supports high-growth companies and fund partners by investing alongside private investors to use technology to solve critical challenges in areas of strategic interest and importance and to build a robust startup ecosystem across New York State.

Nation’s project is also supported by more than $1.3 million in New York Power Authority (NYPA) funding under its Western New York Power Proceeds program. The NYPA funding award is made possible through net earnings resulting from the sale of unused hydropower generated at the Niagara Power Project.

NYPA President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Through a variety of economic development programs, NYPA is supporting businesses throughout the state that are pioneering innovative technology, sparking local investment, and creating jobs in local communities. Natrion’s new Cheektowaga facility, supported by more than $1.3 million in NYPA funding, reflects New York’s efforts to lead the nation in innovation and manufacturing, and is a welcome addition to Western New York’s business landscape.”

Dive Brief:

U.S. data center power demand could reach 106 GW in 2035, BloombergNEF said Monday in one of the more aggressive load growth estimates to date. The U.S. had about 25 GW of operating data centers in 2024, Bloom Energy said earlier this year.

BloombergNEF’s latest forecast is 36% higher than its previous prediction, released in April. The jump is due in part to the higher average size of the 150 significant U.S. data center projects announced in the past year, over a quarter of which are larger than 500 MW, BNEF said.

The Energy Information Administration, which tracks demand for the federal government, generally only publishes detailed projections out two or three years, and few other analyses have attempted firm forecasts as far out as 2035.

Dive Insight:

BNEF’s report comes as some energy industry analysts and executives warn that an artificial intelligence bubble or speculative data center proposals could be fueling excessive load growth projections.

A report from Grid Strategies released last month said utility forecasts of 90 GW additional data center load by 2030 were likely overstated; market analysis indicates load growth in that time frame is likely closer to 65 GW, it said.

A July report from the Department of Energy estimated an additional 100 GW of new peak capacity is needed by 2030, of which 50 GW is attributable to data centers. Those facilities could account for as much as 12% of peak demand by 2028, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

BNEF’s data center project tracker shows the industry diversifying beyond traditional data center hubs like Northern Virginia, metro Atlanta and central Ohio into exurban and rural regions served by existing fiber-optic trunk lines for data traffic.

A map of under-construction, committed and early-stage projects shows gigawatts of planned data center capacity spreading south through Virginia and the Carolinas, up through eastern Pennsylvania and outward from Chicago along the Lake Michigan shore. More data centers are also planned for Texas and the Gulf Coast states.

Much of the capacity is poised to materialize on grids overseen by the PJM Interconnection, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. BNEF predicts PJM alone could add 31 GW of data center load over the next five years, about 3 GW more than expected capacity additions from new generation.

With the expected surge, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned late last year of “elevated risk” of summer electricity shortfalls this year, in 2026 and onward in all three regions.

Some experts disputed NERC’s methodology, however. MISO’s independent market monitor said in June that the group’s analysis was flawed and that MISO was in a better position than grid regions not expected to see exponential data center growth, like ISO New England and the New York Independent System Operator.

Other technology and energy system analysts expect a significant amount of proposed data center capacity to dissipate in the coming years due to chip shortages, duplicative permit requests and other factors.

In July, London Economics International said in a report prepared for the Southern Environmental Law Center that meeting projections for U.S. data center load in 2030 would require 90% of global chip supply — a scenario it called “unrealistic.”

Patricia Taylor, director of policy and research at the American Public Power Association, told Utility Dive earlier this year that it’s common for data center developers to “shop around” the same project across neighboring jurisdictions.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/eW89R5lJ_TOSx3sYtZr6_9z-aPypZ1yRLRlfHQtuWyU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9kYXRhX2NlbnRlcl9WZXJub25fQ2FsaWZvcm5pYS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-03 16:02:20.839997

The agreements — reached after months of proceedings and public input — would reduce the size of the proposed increases while maintaining commitments to reliable service and customer assistance.

For many South Carolinians, understanding what these settlements mean can help them prepare for potential changes in their utility bills in the coming year.

Why This Matters

South Carolina households already pay some of the highest electricity bills in the country. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, South Carolina residents spend about 20% more on electricity than the national average.

Because of these high costs, even modest rate increases can affect family budgets, especially for older adults and those living on fixed incomes. AARP South Carolina continues to monitor developments in the energy sector to help residents understand how rate changes impact affordability and everyday living costs.

Overview of the Settlements

Both Duke Energy Progress (DEP) and Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) filed requests with the PSC in 2025 to raise residential electric rates. After negotiations among the utilities, regulators, and consumer advocates, both companies reached separate settlement agreements that are now before the PSC for review.

These settlements include several key provisions:

Return on Equity (ROE): Duke agreed to a 9.99% ROE, down from the requested 10.85%. The ROE helps determine how much profit the company can earn while recovering its costs to operate and invest in infrastructure.

Basic Facilities Charge: The monthly Residential Basic Facilities Charge — the fixed fee customers pay before using electricity — will remain at $11.78, rather than increasing to $13.00 as initially requested.

Customer Assistance Programs: Both companies have committed shareholder funds to assist customers facing financial hardship through the Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) programs.

DEP: $750,000 per year for two years.

DEC: $1.5 million per year for two years.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Savings: Duke will apply temporary bill credits, or “decrement riders,” to return federal tax savings from the Inflation Reduction Act to customers.

DEP: $10 million over two years.

DEC: $100 million over 22 months.

How This Affects Residential Customers

If the PSC approves the settlements, most residential customers will see smaller increases than originally proposed.

Duke Energy Progress (DEP) customers would see an average 7.3% increase, rather than the proposed 15%. A typical residential bill would rise about $11.23 per month instead of $21.66.

Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) customers would see an average 0.6% increase, rather than 7.6%. A typical residential bill would rise about $0.84 per month instead of $10.38.

The new rates are expected to take effect February 1, 2026, pending PSC approval.

These changes reflect efforts to balance the company’s need to maintain infrastructure with the financial realities faced by consumers across South Carolina.

Additional Settlement Provisions

In addition to rate changes, the settlements include several agreements that will shape how energy rates and programs are managed in the coming years:

Large Load Customers: By June 1, 2026, Duke and other stakeholders will jointly petition the PSC to review rate-making structures for very large customers (50 megawatts and above), such as data centers and manufacturing operations.

Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management (EE/DSM): Within six months of Duke’s planned merger approval, the company will file a petition to review its EE/DSM portfolios. These programs help reduce energy consumption, promote efficiency, and potentially lower long-term costs for customers.

Merger-Related Commitments: Both settlements outline conditions tied to the proposed combination of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, including how future rate filings will be handled and how customer benefits from federal tax credits will continue to be applied.

What Consumers Should Know

Even with smaller increases than initially proposed, electricity costs remain a growing concern for many households. AARP South Carolina encourages residents to:

Review their utility bills carefully once new rates take effect to understand how the changes apply to their usage.

Explore available assistance programs, including Duke’s Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) program and other community-based utility assistance initiatives.

Take advantage of energy efficiency programs that may help reduce monthly costs, such as weatherization and appliance upgrade rebates.

Stay informed about PSC proceedings, especially as the merger between Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas advances and new rate cases are filed.

The Bigger Picture: Energy Costs in South Carolina

The settlements highlight the ongoing challenge of maintaining reliable energy infrastructure while keeping rates affordable. As South Carolina continues to grow, the demand for energy — especially from industries, data centers, and new developments — is expected to increase.

At the same time, extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and the transition to cleaner energy sources are putting additional pressure on utilities and regulators.

Balancing these priorities will remain a central issue for state policymakers, consumer advocates, and residents alike.

AARP South Carolina will continue to follow these developments and share information to help consumers make informed decisions about energy use, assistance programs, and rate changes that affect their household budgets.

Holtec Ends New Mexico Waste Site Plans and Secures Major Federal Deal

After deciding it would abandon plans to build another nuclear waste storage site in southeastern New Mexico, Holtec Government Services landed a major federal contract regarding the building of small modular reactors in the U.S.

DOE Announces Major Federal Funding for SMR Projects

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the selection of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec Government Services to support early deployments of advanced light-water small modular reactors (SMRs) in the United States.

The project teams will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the Nation’s capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains.

The selections announced will help deliver new nuclear generation in the early 2030s, strengthen domestic supply chains, and advance President Trump’s Executive Orders to usher in a nuclear renaissance and expand America’s Energy Dominance agenda.

Federal Leaders Emphasize Need for Rapid Nuclear Deployment

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

Project Teams and Funding Breakdown

With the announcement, DOE is supporting the following first-mover teams to develop and construct the first Gen III+ small modular reactor (Gen III+ SMR) plants in the United States:

Holtec Government Services, LLC (Holtec) — $400,000,000

Holtec plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, demonstrating viability for additional orders both domestically and abroad.

Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) — $400,000,000

TVA plans to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee, as well as accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl.

Additionally, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

DOE Pushes for Rapid Nuclear Growth to Meet Demand

As the nation prepares for continued growth in electricity demand, President Trump has charged DOE with adding new, affordable and reliable energy to keep America energy secure. Small modular reactors offer flexible deployment, proven technology, and the ability to leverage existing supply chains, making them one of the fastest and most scalable pathways to new nuclear capacity.

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.",,N,,2025-12-03 18:04:00.844156

CoE Strategy on the Environment","Opening remarks for Mr Gianluca Esposito

Acknowledge the President of the Deputies, Ambassador Cujba; the GME Chair, Ambassador Diamantopoulou; the Chair of the PC-ENV, Mr Pepřík; Council of Europe authorities; ambassadors; members of the GME; and Permanent Representatives present.

Warmly welcome participants to this important occasion on behalf of the Secretary General.

Thank the Moldovan Presidency of the Committee of Ministers for its strong support for the Council of Europe’s environment-related activities.

Recall that at the Ministerial Session in May, Ministers adopted two landmark texts:

the Council of Europe Strategy on the Environment, a forward-looking and holistic vision reaffirming the inseparable link between a healthy environment, human rights, the rule of law and democracy; and

the Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law, a global, legally binding instrument designed to help States prevent, prosecute and sanction the most serious environmental crimes.

Refer back to the 4th Summit of Heads of State and Government in Reykjavík (2023), where European leaders committed to intensifying efforts against climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss — commitments that this Strategy and Convention help to realise.

Highlight the Organisation’s determination to put the Strategy into action and to strengthen international cooperation. In this respect, welcome the recent CM decision to establish the Steering Committee on Environment (CDENV), which will play a pivotal role in ensuring effective implementation of the Strategy and its Action Plan.

Underline that the Strategy stresses building stronger partnerships. Announce, in this context:

the process of finalising a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Environment Programme, to advance our shared objective of addressing the impact of the triple planetary crisis on human rights, democracy, and the rule of law; and

the Council of Europe’s participation in COP30 in Belém, with a series of side events exploring the intersection of human rights, climate action and democratic governance.

Recall that, under Objective 2 of the Strategy, the GME will tomorrow hold a thematic debate on environment, disinformation and misinformation, with UN rapporteurs, experts, Parties to relevant international treaties and civil society representatives.

Recall that, under Objective 3, the Council of Europe will host the First European Forum of Environmental Human Rights Defenders on 3–4 June 2026 at Headquarters — a joint initiative with the UN and EU to foster multi-stakeholder dialogue and support a safe and enabling environment for environmental defenders.

Highlight that, under Objective 4, the opening for signature of the new Convention sends a powerful message: protecting the environment is a shared responsibility, requiring determination, legal certainty and collective will.

Congratulate the States that will sign today and encourage all others to do so as soon as possible, to help ensure this important Convention enters into force swiftly.

Recall that, under Objective 5, the Organisation recently held a Ministerial Conference marking the 25th anniversary of the Landscape Convention, resulting in the adoption of the Florence Declaration.

Underline that the Florence Declaration encapsulates the unique contribution the Council of Europe can make to international, national and societal efforts to secure a clean, healthy and sustainable environment for all — now and for future generations — in line with Objective 1 of the Strategy.

Highlight the strong link between social development, social rights and environmental protection, as recognised in the Doha Political Declaration adopted at the recent World Summit for Social Development.

Recall the Secretary General’s New Democratic Pact for Europe, which places social justice, public health, and environmental protection at the heart of democratic governance, reflecting the ambitions of the Strategy, notably Objective 2.

Conclude by stressing that, ultimately, our work on the environment is about human and social rights; about resilience, justice and the strength of our democracies — the very essence of what the Council of Europe stands for.

Jurisdictional Waters Re-Defined (40 C.F.R.
Monitor State Responses: Watch for increased state regulation or new permitting schemes in areas where federal oversight is reduced.
Consult Experts: Engage environmental counsel or consultants to navigate evolving federal and state requirements and potential NEPA implications.
The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA.","On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) issued a proposed rule to amend the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (90 Fed. Reg. 82320, Nov. 20, 2025). The agencies’ proposal responds directly to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), and aims to align federal jurisdiction with the Court’s limitations while reducing ambiguity for regulators and regulated entities.

If finalized, this rule could significantly reduce the number of CWA Section 404 and Section 401 permits required for greenfield and infrastructure development, especially in areas with ephemeral or isolated water features. However, stakeholders should be aware that state-level regulatory responses are likely, particularly in jurisdictions that traditionally exercised broader water protections.

Summary of Key Changes to WOTUS Rule

1. Jurisdictional Waters Re-Defined (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(a))

The proposed rule narrows the WOTUS definition by specifying only two jurisdictional categories:

Traditional Navigable Waters (TNWs)

Relatively Permanent Waters and Their Adjacent Wetlands

This excludes several previously jurisdictional features and emphasizes Sackett’s “continuous surface connection” test.

2. “Relatively Permanent” Standard Clarified (§ 120.2(c)(7))

The rule defines “relatively permanent” as surface waters that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or during the “wet season.” The “wet season” is defined as periods when monthly precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, based on long-term climatic data. Ephemeral streams, by contrast, are excluded under § 120.2(d)(4).

Additionally, such waters must:

Possess a bed and bank

Connect to a downstream jurisdictional water via a relatively permanent flow path (§ 120.2(c)(7)(ii))

Tributaries that flow only in response to precipitation events—i.e., ephemeral streams—are no longer jurisdictional.

3. Adjacent Wetlands Must Be Physically and Hydrologically Connected (§ 120.2(c)(8))

Jurisdictional wetlands must:

Physically abut a jurisdictional water (e.g., TNW or relatively permanent water)

Have surface water continuously present during the wet season

Critically, the rule clarifies that a wetland separated from jurisdictional waters by discrete features (e.g., levees, berms, or culverts) is not “adjacent” unless surface water is continuously present on both sides during the wet season (§ 120.2(c)(8)(ii)).

4. Elimination of “Interstate Waters” as a Standalone Category

Interstate waters are no longer jurisdictional based solely on their interstate nature. They must independently qualify under the revised categories (§ 120.2(b)(1)).

Expanded and Clarified Exclusions (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(d))

The rule proposes new clarity around exclusions:

Groundwater is expressly excluded, including tile-drained and subsurface flows (§ 120.2(d)(1))

Non-navigable ditches constructed entirely in dry land are excluded, even if they eventually convey relatively permanent flow (§ 120.2(d)(3))

Prior Converted Cropland retains its exemption unless abandoned for >5 years and reverted to a WOTUS-qualifying wetland (§ 120.2(d)(2))

Waste Treatment Systems are excluded under an expanded definition that includes treatment ponds, lagoons, and infiltration systems (§ 120.2(d)(5))

Section 404(f) Farming Exemptions remain unchanged, continuing to protect routine agricultural discharges (§ 120.2(f))

Implications for CWA Permitting Programs

CWA Section 404: Fewer Permits, Fewer Delays

By narrowing the scope of WOTUS, the agencies expect a marked reduction in Section 404 permit obligations, particularly for projects involving ephemeral streams and non-abutting wetlands. This is likely to reduce costs, project delays, and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) triggers tied to Section 404 actions.

Notably, in arid or semi-arid regions, where ephemeral waters dominate, the proposal could eliminate permitting requirements for many previously regulated features.

CWA Section 401: Reduced Certification Burden

Because Section 401 certifications are contingent on federal permits, the expected decline in Section 404 permits will lead to fewer 401 certification requests. This may reduce administrative workload for state and tribal agencies.

CWA Section 402: Nuanced Impact

Discharges from point sources to waters no longer deemed jurisdictional may no longer require National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. However, permit obligations may persist if pollutants ultimately reach a WOTUS via hydrological or artificial conveyance systems.

State Response and Potential Regulatory Gaps

While the proposed rule reduces federal oversight, it acknowledges that states and tribes may respond by expanding state-level jurisdiction (90 Fed. Reg. at 82325). Currently, at least 24 states regulate waters more broadly than the federal standard, including Washington, Oregon, and California. These states may develop or expand dredge-and-fill programs to fill potential regulatory gaps.

For instance, Washington State has already initiated steps to establish a Section 404 analog at the state level, ensuring continuity in environmental protection despite federal contraction.

What Should Stakeholders Do Now?

Below are key considerations and timely moves that stakeholders may want to discuss with counsel:

Map and Assess: Identify and reassess project site water features under the revised definitions.

Engage in the Rulemaking: Public comments are due by January 5, 2026, and may be submitted through regulations.gov under Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OW–2025–0322.

Monitor State Responses: Watch for increased state regulation or new permitting schemes in areas where federal oversight is reduced.

Consult Experts: Engage environmental counsel or consultants to navigate evolving federal and state requirements and potential NEPA implications.

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/President-Bush-with-corn-2048x1437.jpeg,N,,2025-12-03 16:02:24.361020

“They were not making cars more affordable -- they were making them less affordable,” Duffy said of the Biden administration.","President Donald Trump unveiled a “reset” of federal fuel-economy standards for vehicles during an Oval Office announcement on Wednesday afternoon.

The White House said Trump's plan will save American families ""$109 billion in total over the next five years"" by resetting the Biden Administration’s ""costly and unlawful"" Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

Trump said the Biden administration standards imposed ""unrealistic"" fuel economy targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle (EV) mandate.

He said his proposal will significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year.

""It's a very big deal,"" Trump said during a news conference that included several top auto executives, such as Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who both praised the president's planned changes.

""My administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs, and make buying a car much more affordable for countless American families -- and also safer. We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome CAFE standards,"" he added, also noting that Biden's policies were detrimental to automakers.

Farley said the rollback is is ""a victory for common sense and affordability.""

""It's the right move for a lot of reasons,"" Farley said at the event, adding that the plan allows Ford to make vehicles more affordable.

Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards.

""It's a great day for us at Stellantis because it's a day where we see CAFE regulations reconcile with real customers' demands,"" Filosa said. ""That's why, at Stellantis, we decided to invest to JEEP, RAM, Dodge, and Chrysler, $13 billion in the next four years, increasing production by 50%, delivering to the market five new vehicles, and creating 5,000 additional jobs. That's because we believe in what you, [Transportation Secretary Sean] Duffy, and all your team is doing in this country.""

The Trump administration said the new rules would increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as CAFE, soon after Trump took office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

“They were not making cars more affordable -- they were making them less affordable,” Duffy said of the Biden administration.

Duffy also said Trump's reset is projected to save more than 1,500 lives and prevent nearly a quarter-million serious injuries through 2050.

During Biden's term, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles per gallon today.

The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

Trump said the auto industry complained that both Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

Trump’s latest step to disincentivize electric vehicle production

Mike Bedigan

Wednesday 03 December 2025 18:50 GMT

The Trump administration is set to announce a significant rollback of federal fuel standards, which were originally designed to encourage the sale of electric vehicles.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal will reduce fuel economy requirements for vehicles from model years 2022 to 2031.

This decision contrasts with the Biden administration's earlier plans to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements to around 50 miles per gallon by 2031.

The heads of major US automakers, including Ford, Stellantis, and GM, will join Trump for the announcement, hailing the move as ""a win for common sense.""

The administration frames this as a measure to boost the automobile business, following previous actions such as rescinding EV tax credits and halting California's proposed ban on gas-powered vehicles.

“They were not making cars more affordable -- they were making them less affordable,” Duffy said of the Biden administration.","President Donald Trump unveiled a “reset” of federal fuel-economy standards for vehicles during an Oval Office announcement on Wednesday afternoon.

The White House said Trump's plan will save American families ""$109 billion in total over the next five years"" by resetting the Biden Administration’s ""costly and unlawful"" Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

Trump said the Biden administration standards imposed ""unrealistic"" fuel economy targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle (EV) mandate.

He said his proposal will significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year.

""It's a very big deal,"" Trump said during a news conference that included several top auto executives, such as Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who both praised the president's planned changes.

""My administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs, and make buying a car much more affordable for countless American families -- and also safer. We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome CAFE standards,"" he added, also noting that Biden's policies were detrimental to automakers.

Farley said the rollback is is ""a victory for common sense and affordability.""

""It's the right move for a lot of reasons,"" Farley said at the event, adding that the plan allows Ford to make vehicles more affordable.

Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards.

""It's a great day for us at Stellantis because it's a day where we see CAFE regulations reconcile with real customers' demands,"" Filosa said. ""That's why, at Stellantis, we decided to invest to JEEP, RAM, Dodge, and Chrysler, $13 billion in the next four years, increasing production by 50%, delivering to the market five new vehicles, and creating 5,000 additional jobs. That's because we believe in what you, [Transportation Secretary Sean] Duffy, and all your team is doing in this country.""

The Trump administration said the new rules would increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as CAFE, soon after Trump took office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

“They were not making cars more affordable -- they were making them less affordable,” Duffy said of the Biden administration.

Duffy also said Trump's reset is projected to save more than 1,500 lives and prevent nearly a quarter-million serious injuries through 2050.

During Biden's term, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles per gallon today.

The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

Trump said the auto industry complained that both Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

What Happened

According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, VR Advisory Services increased its stake in ProPetro (PUMP +7.43%) during the third quarter. The fund bought 2.5 million additional shares, raising its position value to $19.3 million at quarter-end. ProPetro accounted for 4.7% of the fund’s $412.4 million in reportable equity assets.

What Else to Know

Top five holdings after the filing:

NASDAQ: KSPI: $88 million (21.3% of AUM)

NYSE: YPF: $87.6 million (21.2% of AUM)

NASDAQ: HEPS: $42.9 million (10.4% of AUM)

NYSE: IRS: $31.4 million (7.6% of AUM)

NYSE: AL: $23.9 million (5.8% of AUM)

As of Wednesday, shares of ProPetro were priced at $10.38, up 22% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 13% in the same period.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

ProPetro offers hydraulic fracturing, cementing, acidizing, and coiled tubing services primarily to oil and gas exploration and production companies.

The company generates revenue by providing pressure pumping and related oilfield services to North American energy producers.

It serves upstream oil and gas operators focused on developing North American oil and natural gas resources.

ProPetro is a leading oilfield services provider specializing in hydraulic fracturing and complementary well completion solutions. The company leverages a modern fleet and technical expertise to support efficient resource development for North American energy producers. With a strong regional presence and a focus on operational reliability, ProPetro aims to deliver cost-effective, high-performance services in a competitive market.

Foolish Take

ProPetro is in the middle of a strategic pivot, expanding beyond traditional completions into a long-duration power business (PROPWR) that’s starting to show real commercial traction. For long-term investors, a fund adding to this name now suggests conviction that the company’s cash-generating core and its emerging power platform can coexist—even in a choppy oilfield services cycle. And with shares still down sharply from multi-year peaks, the bet hinges on durability rather than momentum.

VR Advisory’s increased position comes just as ProPetro posted a resilient third quarter: Revenue fell 10% to $294 million and adjusted EBITDA declined to $35 million, but the completions business still produced $25 million in free cash flow, and the company ended the quarter with $158 million in liquidity. PROPWR was the standout. Management locked in more than 150 megawatts of contracted capacity and expects to exceed 220 MW by year-end, with ambitions to reach 1 gigawatt by 2030. That expansion is capital-intensive, but a new $350 million lease facility is designed to fund it without stretching the balance sheet. If PROPWR scales as planned and completions stay cash-positive through the cycle, ProPetro’s risk-reward profile could look meaningfully different than in past downturns.

Texas industry groups hoping to claim credit for their neighbor’s progress should take a closer look.
MethaneSAT finds that methane intensity on the New Mexico side of the Delaware sub-basin is half that of Texas, despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.
In Texas, production has increased modestly — around 20 percent — yet absolute emissions also remained flat, producing no meaningful improvement in intensity.
That report found positive progress in upstream methane intensity but uses a methodology that omits important emissions data and should be used as an important, but incomplete indicator of methane performance.","By and Benek Robertson

New data and analysis show that while production increased in both states, decreasing loss rates in New Mexico reflects that progress is possible with strong methane standards.

Findings show that methane intensity on the New Mexico side of the Delaware sub-basin is half that of Texas, despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020, with the vast majority (83 percent) of basin-wide emissions coming from Texas.

If you’ve been following the oil and gas industry’s commentary on its methane performance, you might think that the Texas Permian is cleaner than ever. But new measurement data and analysis from the Permian’s Delaware sub-basin show that New Mexico is improving efficiency by capturing more methane while production soars, whereas Texas is maintaining the status quo.

Drawing on nine satellite overpasses between May 2024 and March 2025, MethaneSAT provides the first robust, measurement-based comparison of methane emissions intensity across the Permian’s Delaware Sub-Basin in New Mexico and Texas — two states that share a resource but allow operations under very different regulatory frameworks.

Texas industry groups hoping to claim credit for their neighbor’s progress should take a closer look. MethaneSAT finds that methane intensity on the New Mexico side of the Delaware sub-basin is half that of Texas, despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020. While New Mexico’s production has surged, the vast majority of the Permian’s methane pollution still comes from the Texas side. MethaneSAT data show that 83 percent of basin-wide emissions — over three million metric tons annually — originate in Texas. In Texas, production has increased modestly — around 20 percent — yet absolute emissions also remained flat, producing no meaningful improvement in intensity.

Portraying Incomplete Data as Mission Accomplished

In recent years, trade groups have used analyses like this recent S&P report (July 2025) in communications about upstream methane intensity — the amount of methane that is released relative to total energy production. That report found positive progress in upstream methane intensity but uses a methodology that omits important emissions data and should be used as an important, but incomplete indicator of methane performance.

Another S&P data analysis, released in October 2025, also reports a decline in absolute emissions. However, these reports both employ measurements from remote sensing technologies that can only detect higher emitting point sources, therefore missing many smaller, dispersed sources that our research shows account for a substantial share of total emissions. Nor do these S&P analyses identify the specific regions that were surveyed. They appear to present oil and gas emissions in New Mexico and Texas together, despite clear regulatory and operational differences across the state line. We need direct measurement-based data for total methane emissions from entire oil and gas basins and sub-basins to be able to make the kinds of claims that industry is touting.

Other papers have corroborated MethaneSAT’s latest findings and illustrate that absolute emissions remain stubbornly high. Varon et al.’s 2025 paper studied the region using weekly satellite observations, finding that total emissions in the Permian region remained flat, and “the decline in methane intensity continues to reflect increasing production, not decreasing emissions.” Despite regional intensity improvements, climate and air pollution from the oil and gas industry remains staggeringly high. Industry should not claim success while continuing to release millions of metric tons of climate super pollutants every year. To remain globally competitive — and to safeguard their employees and neighbors — oil and gas producers and regulators need to better address the industry’s persistent emissions.

Data transparency and scientific rigor matter. Although these S&P reports demonstrate growing remote sensing capabilities in providing methane emissions data, it’s misleading for the Texas industry to claim credit for broad emissions reductions — on either an intensity or on an absolute emissions basis — from data sets that present only a subset of a region’s emissions.

One Producing Basin, Two Vastly Different State Landscapes

New Mexico has adopted a prohibition on routine flaring, a robust leak detection and repair program and nation-leading policies to phase out intentionally polluting equipment. Texas, meanwhile, remains stuck in the past. It routinely allows the wasteful practice of associated gas flaring and functionally exempts smaller wells from basic best management practices like leak detection and repair. Lax and outdated standards for equipment like process controllers fail to address the industry’s second largest source of emissions.

Industry continues to fall short of its own methane-reduction targets. In New Mexico’s Delaware Sub-Basin, methane intensity is still 5 times higher than industry’s own commitments under the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter. Texas will need to reduce emissions even more drastically. And the costs of the state’s inaction are only compounding. Texans are already feeling the impacts of our changing climate, including worsening droughts, extreme heat, and catastrophic storms and flooding. Science shows that reducing methane pollution now is the fastest way to slow warming.

The path forward isn’t mysterious. Texas can cut waste, create jobs, and protect communities by following the playbook already working in New Mexico — curb routine flaring, require regular leak inspections and deploy cleaner equipment. New Mexicans are reaping the benefits of regulations requiring more responsible production: an additional $125 million in natural gas captured annually, adding $27 million in royalties and revenue for taxpayers.

Texas policymakers can’t keep allowing industry to point at progress across the border while refusing to clean up their own backyard. The tools, technology and talent are already here — what’s missing is action.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Tx-blog-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 14:05:18.775710

In the wake of tariffs, immigration crackdowns, geopolitical disruptions, and heightened uncertainty, the pace of US job growth has slowed significantly in recent months and has been trending at a pace well below historical patterns. In addition, performance across industries has recently been notably uneven. While current challenges are clearly affecting near-term expansion, looking out over a few decades, we are still seeing signs of solid potential.

One factor influencing US growth at present is the performance of other countries. Leading global economic analysts are generally projecting moderate growth over the next few years, which is a welcomed signal. However, significant downside risks could affect not only the immediate situation, but also the long-term outlook. One factor which could reduce future gains is the potential for decreased supply chain efficiencies, whether from trade tensions due to policy decisions or ongoing international conflicts.

Another concern is the high cost of energy, which is curtailing growth (as well as quality of life) in numerous countries. Prices are negatively affecting expansion in Europe and other areas, and overall inflation remains an issue. While comparatively low energy prices in the US are making manufactured goods more competitive abroad, there are offsetting downside risks arising from stagnant conditions in other major economies. Fiscal challenges are also increasingly problematic, with many countries facing difficult decisions related to rising debt service, growing entitlements (such as pensions for aging populations), and pressing infrastructure requirements.

Simultaneously, there is potential for technology (especially AI) to reshape international patterns by reducing costs, opening markets, and enabling smaller players. However, optimizing these benefits depends on, among other things, efforts to assure access for emerging countries and stable and predictable trade rules.

Over the long-term horizon, the effects of underlying demographic patterns will further affect overall prospects. As with many nations, US birthrates are falling significantly, and virtually all population gains stem from in-migration. AI is potentially a major factor in dealing with the lack of growth in the numbers of people in prime working age ranges (at least temporarily), but for many essential occupations, hands-on work is essential. The need for sensible immigration policies is clear, as is the need for efforts to encourage labor force participation and productivity.

Even with the current challenges, our analysis of the outlook for the US economy indicates moderate growth, with real gross domestic product expanding at a 2.48% annual rate and a gain of some 79.6 million jobs over the next 30 years. The pace will depend in part on how effectively current issues are dealt with, but the fundamental structure of the national economy remains sound. Business cycles are inevitable, but the US economy has a structural framework conducive to long-term expansion. Stay safe!

In this country, some people spend their retirement playing golf. Other people travel. WHYY's Sophia Schmidt reports on how some retirees in Philadelphia spend their time.

SOPHIA SCHMIDT, BYLINE: Bob Meyer is 71 years old. He retired from a career as a biology professor, but he still likes to keep busy.

BOB MEYER: The horrible lure of retirement is to do nothing, and, you know, that's no good because you just end up vegetating at home watching, you know, daytime TV, and I don't want to do that.

SCHMIDT: Instead, Meyer volunteers with the Senior Environment Corps in northwest Philadelphia. The group of more than a dozen retirees take on projects like sampling the soil and testing the area's waterways for pollution. Today, Meyer is in a lab at a local college. He's looking through a microscope, counting tiny pieces of plastic - or microplastics - from a sample of creek water.

MEYER: OK. I got a pretty sharp view now.

SCHMIDT: He finds tiny pieces with jagged edges and thin, plastic fibers.

MEYER: Ah. Got a thread, and it's pink, so I know it's plastic.

SCHMIDT: Altogether, Meyer finds dozens of pieces of microplastics in this one small sample of creek water.

MEYER: I don't know how you get it out. I know how you stop it. You stop using plastic. But that's - I'll - we'll be pushing up the daisies before that stops.

SCHMIDT: It's not all counting plastics in the lab. Some volunteers wade into streams to collect water samples. Others teach kids how to identify aquatic critters. Meyer and fellow volunteer David Schogel say the group is always looking for new members to join.

Anything you're particularly looking for in people who join?

MEYER: Youth (laughter).

DAVID SCHOGEL: If they're breathing...

(LAUGHTER)

MEYER: Yeah.

SCHOGEL: ...We want them.

SCHMIDT: Schogel is 85 and a retired social worker. He sees the nearly three decades he's volunteered with the Senior Environment Corps as part of his legacy.

SCHOGEL: I'm not a wealthy fellow, and I don't have any money to leave behind to any groups or even my family, but I can leave a better world.

SCHMIDT: The group meets monthly at a senior center. That's where 74-year-old Eleanor Lundy-Wade found out about it. She's a former health inspector and public health educator.

ELEANOR LUNDY-WADE: I said, they're seniors that love and do the environment? I said, I want to be one of them.

SCHMIDT: Fred Lewis helped found the group more than 30 years ago. At 98, he's the oldest member. He says the corps has been testing water quality for years, but looking for microplastics is new. Lewis is old enough to remember back when plastic first became widely used.

FRED LEWIS: I mean, it was just something that was so new that people were just trying to get suggestions as how we can take advantage of it. And now it's how we can end it.

SCHMIDT: Lewis says some people might assume that the older you get, the less involved with society you become, but he hopes this group changes some minds.

UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER: At the count of three.

SCHMIDT: At the end of every meeting, the volunteers close by singing the Senior Environment Corps song.

This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Trump administration has renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, now calling it the National Laboratory of the Rockies, marking an identity shift for the Colorado institution that has been a global leader in wind, solar, and other renewable energy research.

“The new name reflects the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation, and honors the natural splendor of the lab’s surroundings in Golden, Colorado,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director, in a statement.

He did not specify what this “broader vision” would mean for the lab’s programs or its staff of about 4,000.

The renaming is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to deemphasize or cut the parts of the federal government that support renewable energy, while also expanding federal support for fossil fuels.

Asked for details, the Department of Energy said in an email that the renaming “reflects the Department’s renewed focus on ‘energy addition,’ rather than the prioritization of specific energy resources.”

A lab spokesman had no additional information about whether there will be changes to programs or headcount at the lab.

Bill Ritter, a Democrat who was governor of Colorado from 2007 to 2011, said it’s reasonable to worry that the name change signals that the federal government is abandoning the lab’s status as a world leader in renewable energy research. “It’s an iconic research facility,” he said.

Underscoring this point, he recalled a trip to Israel while he was governor. “The head of their renewable energy laboratory said, ‘I have nothing to tell you, because you come from the place that has the best renewable energy laboratory in the world,’” Ritter said.

After leaving office, Ritter founded the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, which specializes in energy policy research, and is now a consultant on energy business and policy.

Based on this experience, he thinks that anything the Trump administration does to divert from the lab’s mission is harmful to the United States’ ability to remain a major player in the energy economy of the near future.

“We’ll no longer be competitive in renewables research with China or India or other countries that are still heading toward the renewable energy transition at a very fast pace,” he said.

People with close ties to the lab were not surprised by the name change, given the administration’s broader goals.

“In the early days of DOGE people there were whispering about a name change to avoid the ire of MAGAs,” said Matt Henry, a Montana-based social scientist who worked at the lab from February 2024 to August 2025, in a post on Bluesky. “It pissed me off—prioritizing the preservation of the institution at the expense of its [stated] mission? So disappointing.”

He was referring to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to cut federal spending in the early months of the Trump administration. The term MAGA refers to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan and movement.

Dustin Mulvaney, a San Jose State University environmental studies professor, said if the name change is a sign of a significant change in the lab’s work, it would be “like losing several major land grant research universities all at once.”

Mulvaney has done projects in partnership with people at the lab. An important part of the institution’s work, he said, is that its research is free and accessible to the public, helping businesses and universities that may not be able to afford the work of private research firms.

The lab’s mission has included consulting to help communities benefit from new energy technologies, and ensure smooth transitions away from fossil fuels.

This work meant that the lab was out of step with an administration that has said it disagrees with the idea of a transition away from fossil fuels and has sought to impede funding and development of renewable energy.

The lab was established in 1974 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, part of a law signed by President Gerald Ford to facilitate alternatives to importing oil from the Middle East, according to a history on the lab’s website. The US was suffering through high gasoline prices amid tensions with oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” said Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of energy, in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand.”

In 1977, the federal government selected Golden, Colorado, as the location for the lab.

In his letter, Polis highlighted a report that found 94% of users said the experience with the federal tool was “above average” or “excellent.” In Colorado, it was expected to save taxpayers $140 million per year while helping them to secure $80 million in federal tax credits, according to a report by the progressive nonprofit the Economic Security Project, while saving individuals hours of work.

“Direct File offered a free, efficient alternative that saved taxpayers both time and money, making government more efficient and reducing taxpayer errors,” Polis wrote in his letter to Bessent. “… There is no substitute for Direct File and we urge Treasury to look again at the results and reconsider their decision, given how successful direct file was.”

One of the incentives to install one in recent years has been a federal tax credit under the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. This allowed homeowners who installed a heat pump to claim a credit on their owed taxes that equaled 30% of qualified expenses up to $2,000.

As of Dec. 31, 2025, this credit will no longer be available, but there are still a lot of reasons to upgrade to a heat pump even if you don’t qualify for the tax credit. GOBankingRates spoke with D.R. Richardson, CEO and co-founder of Elephant Energy, to discuss the benefits of installing a heat pump for heating and cooling your home.

More Comfortable Heating and Cooling

The number one reason to upgrade to a heat pump according to Richardson? A more comfortable heating and cooling experience. A traditional furnace will heat up the air in the room and then stop running, but the heat will then dissipate into the furniture and the walls. Then the furnace will kick on again to heat the air and the cycle continues.

When a heat pump heats your home, “the heat goes into the couches and the walls and the other pieces of furniture in your home at a much more even pace, which means that it stays that temperature,” Richardson said. This means that it takes a little longer to get your home to the right temperature, but it heats and cools the home evenly. “[It] provides a much more comfortable environment for your home,” he added.

Improved Air Quality

Traditional furnaces create heat by burning methane and converting it to heat. But not all of it converts to heat and it emits CO2 which can affect the indoor air quality in your home as well as the outdoor air quality.

Heat pumps don’t actually create heat, they move it. “You’re not burning anything. Instead, you’re moving heat around using electricity. This works even in very cold temperatures because there is still ambient heat in the air even if it feels very cold,” Richardson explained. “The reverse is true when it’s cooling-it pulls heat out of the home and directs it outdoors, cooling the interior.”

All of this means that the indoor air quality in your home will be better with a heat pump over a furnace.

Savings Even Without Incentives

Even without the tax credit incentive, purchasing and installing a heat pump can be more affordable than installing a furnace and an air conditioner. For homeowners who have been heating with expensive fossil fuels, for example “electric baseboard heating or delivered fuel oil or propane,” Richardson said you’ll notice the difference pretty quickly and he estimated that “customers are saving hundreds, if not thousands, off dollars per year, depending on the price of electricity in their market. If you’re coming from natural gas, you’ll be paying about the same to run your heat pump.”

State Rebates May Be Available

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Home Efficient Rebates (HOMES or HER) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) programs allow states to reimburse homeowners directly when they purchase a heat pump. You can check your state’s eligibility requirements to see if your heat pump will qualify for a rebate and for how much.

Grid stability: Advanced nuclear complements renewables and helps address transmission constraints.
Hochul’s decision to direct NYPA towards advanced nuclear development marks a pivotal moment for New York’s industrial future.","New York has taken a significant step toward reintroducing nuclear energy as a core component of its long-term industrial and economic strategy. In June 2025, Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to pursue development of an advanced nuclear facility, signaling that the state is preparing to meet rapid load growth driven by advanced manufacturing, data centers and electronification. This shift positions New York to compete for the next generation of power-intensive industries, including semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and advanced materials production.

For companies evaluating expansion or site selection in New York, this moment presents a rare opportunity to engage early as the state defines its approach to its advanced nuclear deployment.

New York’s Policy Shift Toward Advanced Nuclear

Gov. Hochul’s directive reflects a broader national and global trend: advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular rectors (SMRs) are moving from concept to commercial readiness. Her public statements frame nuclear power as a tool to:

Attract large, energy-intensive manufacturers to upstate New York;

Strengthen grid reliability as AI, cloud services and electronification accelerate demand;

Provide stable, zero-emission baseload that complements intermittent renewables; and

Position the state as a leader in next-generation clean-energy deployment.

The combination of strong public support from the governor and the NYPA mandate creates a strategic opening for companies with significant future energy needs.

Technology Landscape: Advanced Reactors Move Toward Deployment

Advanced reactors represent a fundamental shift in how nuclear energy can be deployed and financed.

Modular manufacturing: SMRs can be factory-built, shipped and deployed quickly, reducing construction duration and cost risk.

Scalable output: Units can be sized to support industrial campuses, fabrication facilities or data-center clusters.

Enhanced safety: Passive safety systems decrease overheating or meltdown risk.

Grid stability: Advanced nuclear complements renewables and helps address transmission constraints.

These attributes directly align with sectors that require high-reliability and predictable long-term energy costs.

Remaining Barriers: Financing and Regulatory Certainty

Despite technological progress, deployment still faces:

Regulatory complexity, even as NRC modernizes its review process;

High capital costs in early phases; and

Financing gaps for first-of-a-kind projects.

Discussions in Congress regarding a potential national infrastructure financing authority could materially change the landscape. Federal credit support, long-term financing tools and project development incentives would reduce risk and enable deployment in markets like New York.

Strategic Considerations for Manufacturers and Large Load Users

Companies considering New York should evaluate opportunities to engage early in state planning processes. Early action can secure:

Preferential access to nuclear-enabled industrial hubs;

Priority positioning in procurement and interconnection discussions;

Eligibility for state and federal incentive programs;

Opportunities to partner with reactor developers, utilities and public agencies; and

Influence over emerging regulatory, siting and permitting frameworks.

This early engagement can materially affect cost structure, siting certainty and long-term operational competitiveness.

FREMONT, CA, UNITED STATES, December 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Electric scooters have moved quietly into the American holiday mainstream. What started as a commuter niche is becoming one of the season’s most quick moving retail trends, as shoppers look beyond TV, sound systems, gaming consoles, and move toward products with real, everyday utility. Families in dense cities, students moving around sprawling campuses, and workers searching for alternatives to cars or rideshares are embracing small electric vehicles as practical gifts - a shift retailers didn’t predict, but one that’s accelerating fast.

This Christmas, U.S. micro-mobility sales are tracking upward across key channels. Web searches for personal electric transport, and scooter brands are climbing into gift-guide territory. A mix of rising fuel prices, expanding bike-lane networks in major cities, and the appeal of an eco-friendly, low-maintenance ride is pulling e-mobility closer to the center of American transport culture. E-Scooters now signal independence, flexibility, and a cut in the monthly cost of getting around.

Kaabo Moves Quickly to Claim the Moment

While many brands are fighting for visibility, Kaabo has stepped into the holiday season with striking timing. The company is pushing deep, clearly communicated discounts across its U.S. store - deals that put high-performance models within reach for shoppers who might normally hesitate at premium pricing. On the brand’s sales page, flagship scooters drop by hundreds of dollars, anchoring a strategy built around momentum rather than slow, incremental growth.

Kaabo already has a strong reputation among riders who value range, torque, and sturdy build quality. By pairing those strengths with aggressive holiday offers, it’s positioning itself not just as another option in the crowd, but as a genuine upgrade path for anyone considering their first e-scooter. The result: a widening gap between Kaabo and slower-moving competitors that haven’t matched the scale or clarity of its holiday push.

The Market Conditions Favor a Fast Climber

The U.S. e-mobility landscape is still young, but the demand curve is steep. More cities are designing infrastructure that supports small electric vehicles. More schools and workplaces encourage alternative commuting. And more consumers are choosing practical tech over disposable trends. Kaabo’s current surge reflects this reality - it isn’t riding hype; it’s riding conditions that now favor brands with performance credibility.

What’s striking is how Kaabo seems to understand the psychology of holiday buying. A scooter isn’t just a gift. It’s a transport upgrade. It’s a new way to move through a city. It’s a shift in lifestyle that arrives fully assembled in the living room. By offering significant savings during the season when Americans are most ready to invest in “big gifts,” Kaabo is converting curiosity into committed ridership.

Disruption in Real Time

Kaabo’s rise has the feel of a brand catching the right wave at the right moment. Its models serve both ends of the spectrum: compact commuters for everyday riders, and high-powered machines for enthusiasts who want something closer to a sport vehicle. That dual appeal gives it reach across multiple buyer segments at once - a rare advantage in a crowded market.

And because Kaabo’s pricing strategy is tied directly to performance value rather than cut-rate positioning, the company isn’t racing to the bottom. It’s pulling the market upward. That’s disruption: not breaking the category, but bending it toward higher expectations of what a scooter should deliver in range, power, and design.

A Holiday Season That Could Reshape the Year Ahead

If the current momentum continues, Kaabo will emerge from the holidays not just with boosted sales, but with deeper U.S. market penetration and stronger long-term loyalty. Each scooter bought in December becomes a rolling advertisement in January. Word-of-mouth spreads quickly in micro-mobility communities, and performance experiences tend to speak louder than marketing.

This Christmas may mark the moment Americans stop viewing electric scooters as optional tech and start seeing them as an everyday tool. Kaabo seems intent on making sure its name is the one most associated with that shift.

The mood, however, is muted by a sharp downturn in the company’s electric vehicle fortunes. Since the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30, demand has plunged, leaving Hyundai’s battery-powered lineup scrambling to regain its footing

How Low Can It Go?

The Ioniq 5 remains Hyundai’s best-selling EV in the US, though November brought little reason to celebrate. Only 2,027 units found buyers across the country, a steep 59 percent drop from the 4,989 sold in November last year.

There was some consolation in the fact that this figure edged up slightly from October’s 1,642 sales, but the wider picture is still uneven. Year-to-date results show a modest 12 percent improvement over 2024, totaling 44,760 cars sold.

Things have been equally as bad for the Ioniq 6, with just 489 being sold this November, a decline of 56 percent. Cumulative sales have also slipped, from 11,055 cars in 2024 to 10,019 so far this year, marking a 9 percent decline.

The seven-seat, three-row Ioniq 9 wasn’t available last year, but it remains a relatively slow seller. A total of 315 found new homes last month, down slightly from the 317 sold in October. Year-to-date, 4,809 have been sold.

Hyundai Sales November 2025

Hyundai’s total November sales have fallen 2 percent from November last year to 74,289 units. So for this year, it still remains in the green, shifting 822,756 vehicles, an 8 percent rise from the 758,304 sold during the first 11 months of 2024.

Hybrids to the Rescue

The big story, though, is hybrids. Sales of electrified models jumped 42 percent, making November Hyundai’s strongest hybrid month on record. That surge has been critical in offsetting the EV slump and maintaining overall growth through the final quarter.

Among individual models, several performed particularly well. In November, The Palisade rose 10 percent to 9,906 units, Santa Fe gained 13 percent to 14,004, and Tucson continued its strong run with an 18 percent increase to 23,762. Even the pint-sized Venue grew 35 percent to 2,059 units.

The Sonata, meanwhile, took a noticeable hit in November, dropping 42 percent year-over-year to 4,018 sales, bringing its year-to-date total to 54,238, down 12 percent from the same period in 2024.

For now, Hyundai’s U.S. lineup shows a clear divide between hybrid gains and weakening EV demand. The next few months will show whether that hybrid momentum can do enough to steady the company’s position in a softening electric market.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Large-61963-2025IONIQ6Limited-copy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 14:04:39.581927

JOHN, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.abc4.com/news/national/ap-trump-plans-to-weaken-vehicle-mileage-rules-that-limit-air-pollution/amp/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected to announce a proposal Wednesday to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks, according to several people familiar with the White House plans.
The move would be the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles.
The Republican administration says the new rules would increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected to announce a proposal Wednesday to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks, according to several people familiar with the White House plans.

The proposal would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year, according to a White House official and several people familiar with the plan. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly because the proposal has not been announced and spoke on condition of anonymity. Further details were not immediately available.

The move would be the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The Republican administration says the new rules would increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Trump is set to announce the plan at a White House event that is expected to include top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers, who have praised the planned changes. Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement Wednesday that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards.

Environmentalists decried the decision.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Trump’s action will feed America’s destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,” Becker said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today.

The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The auto industry has complained that both Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

And the gas plants may be on the way.
These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25.
Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.
Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.","The Southwestern Public Service Company has asked the state of New Mexico to grant exceptions to the state’s Energy Transition Act for two proposed gas-fired power plants, including one exception that would see approximately one-third of the energy produced at one plant qualify as a “zero-carbon resource” like solar panels or wind turbines.

A second exception would exempt both plants from the act’s zero-carbon requirement, “to preserve system reliability and protect customers from unreasonable bill impacts.”

The two proposed plants would be in Texas, with the larger of the two — called Gaines County Power Plant — to be built just across the border from Hobbs, New Mexico. Even though the two wouldn’t be in the state, New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires that all energy sold in the state by investor-owned utilities be from zero-carbon-emission sources by 2045, no matter where it is generated. The act was an early environmental win for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The request is part of a wide-ranging application the Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, has before the Public Regulation Commission of New Mexico for new transmission lines, extended closure dates for existing coal-fired power plants and eight new power facilities — two each of natural gas, solar, wind and battery systems. The $10 billion plan covers the company’s service area in the southeast corner of the state and parts of West Texas.

While most of the proposed plants would generate renewable energy, the two gas plants would generate 51% of the total energy in the application.

“To pretend that natural gas in some way or another is a zero carbon resource is just a bald-faced lie,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, and an energy watchdog. “It’s profound greenwashing.”

The majority of Southwestern Public Service Company’s coverage area and energy sales are in Texas, but, according to Xcel, much of the projected increase in energy would be used in New Mexico, particularly in the state’s portion of the Permian Basin, the nation’s largest oil field. More than 50% of the company’s energy sales in New Mexico already go to oil and gas companies to power their wells and other infrastructure with grid-based electricity. Oil and gas revenues are also the state’s biggest single source of income.

According to the application, replacing the two proposed gas plants with renewable energy sources would cost New Mexico customers an additional $5.5 billion and raise residential electricity rates by more than 40%.

And the gas plants may be on the way. “We have already signed and executed contracts for the turbines,” Kaley Green, a senior media relations representative for Xcel Energy, said. “We anticipate a 40-year service life for each of the plants.”

In the application the company requests that all costs associated with the two solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers because they will be built to meet New Mexico Energy Transition Act requirements, “not because they were needed for the overall system.” In addition, it asks for a speedy approval of the solar plants to secure renewable energy tax credits that were enhanced under President Joe Biden but had their timeframes dramatically curtailed under President Donald Trump.

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25. The commission plans to reach a decision on the Gaines Plant zero-carbon request by Dec. 10 and a decision on the full application by May 7. Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.

“It is a lot for one filing, but it’s not absurd,” said AnnaLinden Weller, senior policy adviser with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit that fights climate change and its impacts across the western U.S. Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “It’s certainly the biggest one that I’ve seen, but not by a huge amount.”

Southwestern Public Service Company cites several factors for the size and complexity of the application: It wants to close two aging coal-fired plants in Texas; it sees increased demand from oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin, data centers and other industries; and there are new requirements from the power-sharing system in which the new plants would operate, the Southwest Power Pool. Despite its name, the pool runs from southeast New Mexico north to the Canadian border, balancing production loads from utility companies in 14 states along the way.

In August 2024, the pool raised the production reserve requirements of member utilities like Xcel from an annual 15% to 16% in summer and 36% in winter. (A production reserve requirement is extra power production capacity available for unexpected peak loads.) The new winter load requirement was in part a response to the winter storms of 2021 and 2022 that created sudden, massive electrical demands from damaged energy systems across the Southwest Power Pool.

The request to keep the new gas-fired plants beyond 2045, when New Mexico pledged to reach zero carbon emissions, aims for a possible loophole in the law.

“So there’s a weird thing about the Renewable Energy Act. It doesn’t prohibit fossil fuels per se,” Weller said, so long as the utility can convince the Public Regulation Commission that it will be producing zero carbon electricity for New Mexico customers by 2045 while hitting ever smaller targets along the way.

Xcel’s Green said, “We will continue to work towards compliance with the 2045 goals and adjust our grid planning as we proceed, based on technology and other factors.”

If that’s not possible, Weller said the commission has the discretion to give utilities “wiggle room” for the 2045 zero carbon requirement if the utility faces reliability or affordability issues — both of which Southwestern Public Service Company explicitly claimed in its application. No utility has tried for such an exemption before, Weller said.

In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas. That plant would have produced about 11% of the electricity that the proposed Gaines County and Tolk plants would generate together. But, “They didn’t have a plan for how it would be possible for them to comply with the Renewable Energy Act,” Weller said — such as asking for exemptions from the act.

Another loophole in the act allows a utility to claim a fossil fuel plant is a “zero carbon resource” if that plant’s use reduces methane emissions “as a result of electricity production” by a 10-to-1 ratio or better of carbon dioxide to methane emissions. Southwestern Public Service Company hired an outside economist to show how electrifying oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin could offset enough methane emitted by wells and associated facilities to qualify roughly one-third of the electricity from the Gaines County plant as “zero carbon.”

“We’re still thinking about that as a legal question,” Weller said. “A plain reading of the Renewable Energy Act [the underlying law for the Energy Transition Act] says that the generation resource has to be zero carbon, not the effects of the generation resource.”

She added, “Are there climate impacts? Yeah. The question is are they big enough or worthwhile enough given what you’re building.”

Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate warming, but methane is far more potent, producing more than 80 times the warming potential as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

On Nov. 12, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 World Energy Outlook, which concluded that oil and gas demand will not peak before 2050, as previously hoped for — and needed — if the planet is to avoid increasingly frequent climate change catastrophes. The report goes on to say that with the increase in fossil fuel use, “exceeding 1.5°C is now inevitable.” Holding global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels was the stated goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.

“There is some low-hanging fruit that we can get from electrifying the oil field, and ideally the infrastructure would be communicable to some future replacement industries that might help the state head in some different direction,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director.

“But you can’t deny the fact that it basically builds a more permanent infrastructure around oil and gas extraction,” she continued. “There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

In 2023, Chevron touted a 20-megawatt solar field it built in southern New Mexico to power a nearby gas facility and reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. For a while, the facility was a prominent focus of the company’s social media advertising in New Mexico.

But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers. The plant is expected to produce 2.5 gigawatts of electricity, 125 times the amount of the solar field.

When asked about the fossil fuel power plants in the Southwestern Public Service Company application and how they mesh with the Energy Transition Act her administration championed, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s office punted.

Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, wrote, “Nearly half of this proposal is renewable energy. The same law that sets those aggressive renewables targets provides an exception process for utilities to protect system reliability. We’re confident the [Public Regulation Commission] can make the technical determination about whether it’s truly necessary. We’ll let that process move forward.”

If approved, Southwestern Public Service Company will build the Gaines County plant about five miles south-southeast of Hobbs, a town of about 40,000. The prevailing wind patterns would carry much of the exhaust from the new plant right over town.

“It’s not like there’s some bright-line border separating New Mexico and Texas’ pollution,” Feibelman said, and the region already suffers from bad air pollution. The American Lung Association has given both Lea and Eddy counties — the center of New Mexico’s portion of the Permian — failing grades for their ozone levels. The American Lung Association does not have ozone figures for the Texas side of the basin.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Permian_2025__01-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 13:01:38.373848

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.
In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.
That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.
Hindered Federal Climate Risk Regulation Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.","Property insurance rates have spiked since 2021 due to the increasing frequency of climate-related natural disasters, inflation in the cost of building materials and supply chain issues. The typical homeowner saw an average increase of $648 in their annual premium from 2021 to 2024. And those rates are expected to increase by an average of 8% nationwide this year — with homeowners in some states facing much higher increases, such as a projected 27% hike in Louisiana.

An increasing number of American homeowners are linking those increases to climate change. A majority of them (72%) say that natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires exacerbated by climate change are somewhat or very responsible for the rise in homeowner insurance costs, according to a poll by Data For Progress.

There is a bipartisan consensus that prices are rising too fast — nearly 80% of homeowners in Texas, for instance, want to see rates reduced, and one-third of Florida homeowners say that rate increases are the most important issue for them (even ahead of inflation and housing costs) — though Americans are torn on the role of climate change.

Insurance companies are regulated on the state level, and there have been heated debates in states as diverse as Idaho, Minnesota, Louisiana and Colorado about policies and regulations to slow the increase in rates. In Iowa, which was expected to see a 19% increase in home insurance rates this year, nearly 180 researchers and educators signed a statement calling attention to the role of climate change in driving up insurance costs — and calling for better building standards and a faster transition to more renewable energy sources in the state, such as solar and wind.

The federal government plays a role in all this through its funding of programs to share the risk of losses such as the National Flood Insurance Program and disaster relief efforts. It also provides access to climate data used by insurers to foresee potential risks and formulate rates.

The Trump administration’s policies on climate, cutting funding to key programs, reducing access to and limiting the collection of climate data, and slashing the ranks of federal regulators are contributing to an increase in property insurance rates for homeowners, said insurance industry analysts and experts.

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.

Asked about the Trump administration’s plans to help reduce property insurance rates, a White House spokesperson declined to speak on the record, but provided Capital & Main with a statement from an unnamed official:

“More people are living in Florida than ever before, which naturally causes an increase in rates,” the statement said. “It’s inaccurate and silly to pin this on climate change. The Administration is working to lower costs across all industries for Americans.”

Tariffs

The steep tariffs on materials like lumber, steel and aluminum are raising construction and repair costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers through higher home insurance premiums. First, insurance coverage limits “may no longer provide enough protection as the cost of materials and labor needed to rebuild your home increases,” noted Wawanesa Insurance in a blogpost. “Second, repair costs following claims will be higher, potentially influencing future premium rates.”

The main insurance industry trade group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, has been actively lobbying against tariffs because of their impact on home insurance.

Cuts to Disaster Relief Funding and Resiliency Programs

The administration has cut disaster relief funds at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are given to local governments and states following natural disasters. The money is used to repair or reconstruct homes and finance housing. Without those resources, communities devastated by such catastrophes won’t be able to rebuild homes and infrastructure in more resilient ways, “and these communities will pay higher insurance premiums as a result,” writes DeLong, the Consumer Federation advocacy associate, and Ethan Weiland, another CFA research associate.

In April the Federal Emergency Management Agency terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, which provided grants to states and communities to fund projects that reduce the risk of damage from flooding, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Ending the program “means terminating mitigation projects that would have saved lives, lowered the risk of property loss, and reduced homeowner, farm, and business property insurance premiums,” DeLong and Weiland noted.

Reduced Access to Critical Climate Data

In May, the administration stopped updating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database for weather and climate disasters that cause more than $1 billion in damage. The database has historically been used by insurance and reinsurance companies to assess risks and project future losses. The loss of that data is likely to lead to less accurate pricing, and cause insurers to hike rates in response to unquantified risk.

In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.

One of the reports, which was uploaded by the Consumer Federation of America, on rising homeowners insurance costs from 2018 to 2022, showed how this increase outpaced the rate of inflation and that policy nonrenewal rates were higher in areas with higher-than-expected losses from climate-related disasters.

“We need reliable, long datasets,” said Kieran Bhatia, head of climate and sustainability for North America at the global reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. “Without them, you basically are kind of putting your finger up to the wind a little bit about what is a realistic [extreme weather] event.”

Bhatia and other climate risk specialists expressed their concerns during a panel discussion during New York Climate Week in September.

“If you want to promote economic growth, the best way to do that is to have good information,” said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress. “Capitalism relies on good information to make an efficient economy and insurers are subject to that rule as well. But now no one has this essential climate information.”

Rollback of Renewable Energy Initiatives

The administration’s rollback of renewable energy initiatives — such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All initiative — has directly impacted the underwriting market for clean energy projects. That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.

And President Donald Trump’s executive orders to block state and local climate change measures — such as those that seek to limit carbon emissions or require oil and gas companies to pay for climate damage — could escalate future litigation risk for insurers as climate change worsens.

“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.

Hindered Federal Climate Risk Regulation

Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.

By reducing federal oversight, the administration is downplaying climate-related financial risks. This leaves property and financial markets more exposed and increases the instability that can be caused by higher costs and limited insurance availability.

Approval of New Fossil Fuel Projects

The administration’s strong push to increase oil and gas production, such as approving six new liquefied natural gas terminals along the Gulf Coast, will likely accelerate the pace of climate change and lead to higher insurance premiums, said Ethan Nuss, senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network.

“The Trump administration’s fast-tracking of dirty energy mega-projects — like the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG (CP2) methane export terminal — increases the risk exposure of both insurers and neighboring communities that will be stuck paying out larger claims and skyrocketing premiums or be forced out of their ‘uninsurable’ homes.”

Despite the current political assault on EVs, the domestic EV market is maintaining its momentum. Consumer interest in EVs remains strong, with nearly 25% of active new car shoppers very likely to buy an EV in the next 12 months. The shift is happening because of the ABCs of EVs:

Affordable—EVs save drivers over $1,000 per year on avoided gas and hundreds more on avoided maintenance.

Better—EVs are high performing and fun to drive and reduce greenhouse gas emissions upwards of 80% compared to gas cars.

Convenient—For most EV owners, 80% of EV charging happens at home while they sleep, while the average range of EVs has tripled over the past decade to approximately 300 miles.

Has your interest in an EV piqued? If so, there has never been a better time to get a good deal on a used EV, with 243,000 EVs coming off lease and heading to the secondary market, where two-thirds of car buyers shop, and where EVs already compete on price with used gas vehicles and outcompete on value. And rest assured, public charging infrastructure is expanding rapidly; fast chargers that support long-distance trips are on pace to surpass 100,000 chargers in 2027, nearly four times the number in 2022.

Gas Cars Have Peaked

Gas cars sales are running out of…gas. Data show that in 2017, global sales of gas cars peaked at 79.9 million. By 2024, that number had sputtered to 54.8 million, a 31% fall. So where did all those car sales go? Well, in 2024, consumers bought 11 million EVs and 6.5 million plug-in hybrids, up from a combined 1.2 million in 2017. Meanwhile, 1 in 4 of all cars sold this year will have a plug. And these number will continue to grow. J.D. Power’s October consumer survey found that nearly 1 in 4 of America’s active new-car shoppers are “very likely” to buy an EV in the next 12 months. Read more.

Used EVs are the Fastest-Selling Cars in the U.S.

New not in your budget? The used EV inventory is expanding rapidly as millions of EVs come off lease. Many of these used EVs have less than 40,000 miles on them and are still covered by their manufacturer’s warranties. Whereas a gas car has about 2,000 moving parts, an EV only has about 20. That means that because EVs cost the same or less than their gas equivalents, you make money when you buy one by significantly decreasing your vehicle maintenance and fueling costs — typically over $1,000/year. Companies like Recurrent now exist to run remote battery checks so you can buy with confidence. Read more.

A Trip to Washington

Despite these encouraging signs, it certainly helps when federal policy is designed to boost the EV transition, not stall it. That’s why I recently joined roughly 30 of my fellow EV advocates in D.C. to meet with over 50 Congressional offices to advocate for transportation electrification. Congress has begun the Surface Transportation Reauthorization (STR) process, which results in an every-5-year bipartisan bill that funds the nation’s transportation system. The last STR resulted in programs designed to build a fast-charging backbone along the nation’s highways and rural areas, put electric schools buses in school districts nationwide, and expand the manufacturing and recycling of advanced batteries.

Global power demand is rising dramatically, driven by rapid growth in advanced manufacturing, data centers, and other energy-intensive industries. In regions like Louisiana and the broader Gulf Coast, this surge underscores a critical need for firm, low-carbon power that can reliably serve industrial loads while aligning with global emissions reduction targets.

Carbon capture represents a critical pathway to meet this demand. However, traditional CO₂ capture systems face significant challenges when dealing with the relatively low CO₂ concentrations found in the flue gas from combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), resulting in high energy penalties and solvent degradation. Addressing these constraints is essential to decarbonizing existing and future CCGT assets. JERA and Newlab seek to advance next-generation capture technologies, including advanced solvents, solid sorbents, membranes, and hybrid configurations, that can materially improve energy efficiency, process durability, and cost performance. By connecting promising startups to industrial environments, the collaboration is structured to accelerate the path from validated pilot performance to commercial deployment.

""JERA Ventures was created to identify, test, and scale breakthrough technologies that can transform the future of global energy systems,"" said Takeshi Kodama, Head of JERA Ventures. ""Through our partnership with Newlab New Orleans, we can validate promising solutions in industrial environments, paving the way for pilot projects and the eventual deployment of commercial-scale technologies capable of supporting power systems across our global markets.""

This initiative is anchored by Newlab's public–private partnership in Louisiana, which leverages the state's long-standing industrial base to attract and commercialize critical technologies across carbon management, advanced fuels, shipping and maritime, and related industrial decarbonization pathways. The platform brings together infrastructure, industry and government partners, and capital to help startups test, iterate, and scale solutions while driving new economic growth in the region. Newlab is working with regional partners to assess existing power generation facilities that could host a demonstration-scale project, in partnership with a selected startup and JERA.

""Louisiana sits at the center of one of the world's most energy-intensive industrial corridors, and the solutions we validate here have global relevance,"" said Sahil Jain, VP of Strategy at Newlab. ""Through our partnership with JERA, we are creating a platform to directly evaluate next-generation carbon capture technologies on real-world flue gas profiles. Our goal is to de-risk technologies that meet the power sector's most urgent decarbonization needs and move faster toward first-of-a-kind deployment.""

This partnership builds on JERA's continued engagement in Louisiana's dynamic energy economy, including its development of the world's largest low-carbon ammonia facility, its ownership stake in the state's largest solar installation — the 300-megawatt Oxbow Solar Farm — and investment in upstream shale gas assets in the Haynesville basin. Together, these initiatives reflect JERA's mission to provide cutting-edge solutions to the world's energy issues.

Looking ahead, Newlab and JERA intend to leverage the applied learnings from this initiative to scale carbon capture and power decarbonization efforts in Louisiana and across other key global markets.",https://www.ajot.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-03 13:02:58.444907

Power generation and transition infrastructure are under unprecedented strain. The artificial intelligence data center boom, combined with a legacy shortfall in proactive investment in the grid, has pushed electricity prices to punitive levels for commercial real estate owners.

As a result, a growing number of building owners are turning to an engineering solution with a technical name that belies its simplicity: ice.

Thermal storage systems store energy not in lithium or another hard-to-extract mineral, but in frozen water, said Brendan Dowd, vice president at Boland, a commercial HVAC systems, services and energy solutions provider in the Washington, D.C., metro area

The systems act like batteries to more intelligently generate or distribute stored energy to meet cooling or heating needs while lowering the impact on the grid and the environment. The thermal battery charges when grid demand and energy costs are low or excess renewable energy is available.

“Most thermal energy storage systems have a large tank or tanks, storing water or ice, which is then used as needed by the building,” Dowd said. “Typically, they make ice at night, when energy is cheap, and then melt it for cooling during on-peak times.”

Flexibility = Savings

In most markets, power utilities apply a higher rate to electricity consumed during peak times, like summer afternoons, when it is more expensive for the utility to generate it, or when renewable energy sources aren’t available and utilities are burning fossil fuels.

That’s a problem for buildings that cannot easily adjust operations, such as offices, schools, museums and government facilities.

“If you dig into your electric bill, you'll see that you're paying more for electricity during peak times of the day,” Dowd said. “This ‘demand charge’ could end up being up to 60% of an overall bill.”

Thermal energy storage systems flatten those peak consumption time spikes. And they allow building owners to capitalize on the times of day when cleaner, cheaper, renewable energy is abundant, Dowd said.

The technology is simple and old-fashioned, albeit with a sophisticated, modern analytics component.

“They melt the ice made during on-peak hours,” Dowd said. “A good portion of the cost, typically 20%, of energy supply is dependent on five peak demand events that take place each summer. With a thermal battery system, building owners can lower their demand on those days.”

Doing Well By Doing Good

While the technology generates savings calculated in dollars and cents, its ancillary benefit is that it reduces a given building’s carbon emissions.

“These systems are extremely green,” Dowd said. “Asset managers love them because they save money, but sustainability managers love them because they reduce the carbon footprint of the facility.”

Incentives: Available and Stackable

With many state and municipal governments ratcheting up their climate goals, there is a patchwork of rebates, grants, programs and other financial incentives building owners can leverage to reduce the cost of installing thermal energy storage systems.

“Rebates and incentives are available and they are stackable,” Dowd said.

The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, expanded the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit, or ITC, to include thermal energy storage. As a result, the technology has a lower “first cost” compared to conventional chilled water plants, Dowd said.

The IRA also expanded the Section 179D tax deduction for commercial buildings to include a new direct payment option for many tax-exempt entities, he said.

With current incentives in place, building owners who invest in thermal battery systems can recoup their initial investment in three years. For perspective, the typical life cycle of these systems is 30 years, Dowd said.

During a recent office building renovation project, which leveraged both Section 48 investment tax credits and local utility incentives, Boland installed a thermal battery system that shifted one megawatt of peak electricity demand and reduced on-peak energy usage by 2.15M kilowatt-hours per year.

Boland offers several variations of thermal energy storage, Dowd said. Full storage systems can cool an entire facility for the entirety of its working hours using just ice. Partial storage systems make less ice and simply trim energy consumption during the day when it is most expensive. Finally, thermal storage systems can be combined with heat pump systems for even greater efficiency.

A Universe of Data Points

With over 4,000 projects completed in 60 countries, Boland, in partnership with Trane, has the institutional knowledge to advise building owners, designers and contractors on how to customize system implementation to maximize benefits for any given facility, Dowd said.

“By combining what we know with a bigger universe of data points and the owners’ own knowledge of their assets, we can unlock energy usage savings and comfort with a great degree of precision,” he said.

The company’s connected mechanical service agreements, or CMSAs, integrate continuous data collection and remote monitoring with traditional on-site HVAC maintenance, offering enhanced transparency into asset performance.

“This approach provides 24/7 operational insights that support Boland Trane technicians in troubleshooting and maintaining equipment,” Dowd said. “Benefits of our CMSAs include lower total cost of ownership, improved equipment uptime and support for sustainability goals.”

A growing headache along the Outer Banks The string of collapses has recently raised the issue to greater national attention.
North Carolina filed more claims than any other state through that program, according to the state’s recent workgroup report.
In 2023, the National Park Service used grant funding to buy and tear down two at-risk homes in Rodanthe.","In recent months, news of Outer Banks homes falling into the ocean seemed nonstop.

Five fell in Buxton within just one hour in late September. Three more came down in the following days. Another five shortly before Halloween.

Since 2020, 27 homes have collapsed along the Outer Banks, all of them unoccupied, as strong waves from storms and rising waters eat away at the shoreline.

The homes leave behind lots of mess: literally, with huge amounts of debris, and financially, for homeowners and taxpayers.

But the property owners have little incentive to take them down proactively, even when disaster appears likely.

The National Flood Insurance Program helps cover only damage after the fact. It does not pay for people to demolish properties before a storm does.

North Carolina leaders are calling on Congress to change that.

“When these houses collapse, they are not just a tragedy for the homeowner,” Gov. Josh Stein and state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey wrote in a joint letter to House leaders last month.

“The destroyed houses also spread pollution and debris for miles and repeatedly result in the closure of once pristine National Seashores and other beaches for public safety. Federal and state taxpayer dollars are then used to clean up the aftermath.”

As structured, the NFIP “provides a perverse incentive,” where it can be in homeowners’ financial interest to avoid taking proactive action, they wrote.

The letter urges federal lawmakers to advance legislation that would allow federal flood insurance to cover relocating or demolishing condemned coastal structures nationwide before they fall, capped at $250,000.

The proposed Preventing Environmental Hazards Act of 2025 is cosponsored by members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation from both sides of the aisle, as well as Virginia Republican Rep. Rob Wittman.

A growing headache along the Outer Banks

The string of collapses has recently raised the issue to greater national attention. But it’s long been on the minds of state and local officials, such as Bobby Outten, manager and attorney for Dare County.

The county includes roughly 100 miles of beachfront, including Rodanthe and Buxton. And “like beaches everywhere on the East Coast, they erode,” Outten said.

County officials have stemmed the issue in many places through beach nourishment, or building up sand to buffer erosion.

But that’s growing increasingly costly. Outten said the county hasn't been able to afford beach nourishment in Rodanthe recently, and a project in Buxton three years ago didn’t last the five years officials expected.

The erosion rate of that mile of beach has increased, and waves have grown closer, now reaching underneath many beachfront houses on stilts.

There are currently about 15 houses “that could go anytime,” Outten said.

When a house falls, debris quickly moves in many directions, stretching far beyond property lines. That makes it tricky to neatly divide responsibility for the cleanup.

“From the county's perspective, when we have storms, there is commingled debris, and you don't know whose it is, you don't know where it came from,” he said. “It piles up everywhere.”

The county treats the mess as it would any other storm, removing debris from roadways and beaches. This year’s messes have cost the local government roughly $200,000.

The National Park Service handles what’s in its jurisdiction, which includes the water. Since September, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore has hauled more than 400 truckloads of debris from fallen houses.

The Park Service reaches out to homeowners to try and recover associated costs, not always successfully.

Homeowners are responsible for cleaning up their private property, moving debris out to the right-of-way. Dare County hauls it to a landfill.

“Needless to say, it's a big mess. It's not what anybody wants,” Outten said. “Nobody believes that you're getting 100% of everything that comes out. You don't know what's floating, you don't know what's sinking, you don't know what's farther out there.”

Debris can threaten people’s health and safety and pollute the environment, including from inundated septic systems releasing sewage into the water. The situation also harms the local economy by giving the county a bad image, despite many miles of beaches still in good shape, he said.

A potential ""budget-neutral"" solution

The renewed push to authorize pre-disaster insurance payments grew out of a collaboration last year by the National Park Service and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

The workgroup laid out short- and long-term ideas for managing threatened oceanfront structures.

Based on aerial imagery from 2020, about 8% of more than 8,000 oceanfront structures across the state were considered at high risk from oceanfront erosion.

The proposed change to the NFIP could provide a “budget-neutral” solution for the most vulnerable structures that are already covered by federal flood insurance, Outten said.

Take a hypothetical homeowner on Hatteras Island whose house is already unlivable and unrentable.

The homeowner has no incentive to remove it, because when it falls, they can get up to $350,000 in pocket from the federal government – $250,000 maximum for damage coverage, plus another $100,000 for the home’s contents, Outten said.

“The question becomes, if NFIP is going to pay that out when it falls a month from now, why not pay it out now, and let's get that house off of the beach before it creates that problem,” he said. “Paying for it today or paying for it next month, really shouldn't make a difference.”

The concept has a precedent.

In the 1980s, after high water levels caused houses in Michigan’s Great Lakes to succumb to bluff erosion, Congress authorized a program that made some structures eligible for NFIP claims to prevent imminent collapse.

North Carolina filed more claims than any other state through that program, according to the state’s recent workgroup report.

But it was discontinued in 1994, replaced by the Flood Mitigation Assistance program, which offers grants instead of insurance. (The Trump administration this year canceled many grants awarded through the program.)

The NFIP initiative offered a quicker fix than the competitive grant process, which can take years to get the money, the North Carolina workgroup noted.

Another way officials could remove structures is through buyout programs. In 2023, the National Park Service used grant funding to buy and tear down two at-risk homes in Rodanthe. The agency has stated it would like to continue the program, but needs a lot more funding.

Meanwhile, local leaders are asking state lawmakers for help to protect Highway 12, the only way in or out of the Outer Banks.

“As the beaches erode and take these houses, the ocean gets closer to Highway 12,” Outten said. “And if we lose Highway 12, and we don't have access for anybody to do anything.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac9f2ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+39/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F53%2F413e1b9842e6b078f57a057c4863%2F556128390-1120339943620905-9039823228889499414-n.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 13:02:24.581346

It’s a bipartisan technology.” Plans for the expansion project call for roughly doubling Framingham’s geothermal network capacity at approximately half the cost of the initial buildout.","The U.S. Department of Energy has approved an $8.6 million grant that will allow the nation’s first utility-led geothermal heating and cooling network to double in size.

Gas and electric utility Eversource Energy completed the first phase of its geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 2024. Eversource is a co-recipient of the award along with the city of Framingham and HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal energy and is the lead recipient of the funding.

Geothermal networks are widely considered among the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. The federal money will allow Eversource to add approximately 140 new customers to the Framingham network and fund research to monitor the system’s performance.

The federal funding was first announced in December 2024 under the Biden administration. However, the contract between HEET and the Department of Energy was not finalized until Sept. 30 and was just announced Wednesday. The agreement, which allows construction to move forward, comes as the Trump administration is clawing back billions of dollars in clean energy funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in Massachusetts.

“This award is an opportunity and a responsibility to clearly demonstrate and quantify the growth potential of geothermal network technology,” Zeyneb Magavi, HEET’s executive director, said in a written statement.

The existing system provides heating and cooling to approximately 140 residential and commercial customers in the western suburb of Boston. The network taps low-temperature thermal energy from dozens of boreholes drilled several hundred feet below ground, where temperatures remain steady at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. A network of pipes circulates water through the boreholes to each building, enabling electric heat pumps to provide additional heating or cooling as needed.

“By harnessing the natural heat from the earth, we are taking a significant step towards increasing our energy independence and promoting abundant local energy sources,” Charlie Sisitsky, Framingham’s mayor, said in a written statement.

Progress on the project is a further indicator that, despite opposition to wind and solar, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress appear to back geothermal energy.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office declaring an energy emergency that expressed support for a limited mix of energy resources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, biofuels, hydropower, and geothermal energy.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump in July, quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar, and electric vehicles. However, the bill left geothermal heating and cooling tax credits approved under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 largely intact.

A reorganization of the U.S. Department of Energy announced last month eliminated the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy but kept the office for geothermal energy as part of the newly created Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.

“The fact that geothermal is on this administration’s agenda is pretty impactful,” said Nikki Bruno, vice president for thermal solutions and operational services at Eversource Energy. “It means they believe in it. It’s a bipartisan technology.”

Plans for the expansion project call for roughly doubling Framingham’s geothermal network capacity at approximately half the cost of the initial buildout. Part of the estimated cost savings will come from using existing equipment rather than duplicating it.

“You’ve already got all the pumping and control infrastructure installed, so you don’t need to build a new pump house,” said Eric Bosworth, a geothermal expert who runs the consultancy Thermal Energy Insights. Bosworth oversaw the construction of the initial geothermal network in Framingham while working for Eversource.

The network’s efficiency is anticipated to increase as it grows, requiring fewer boreholes to expand. That improvement is due to the different heating and cooling needs of individual buildings, ​​which increasingly balance each other out as the network grows, Magavi said.

The project still awaits approval from state regulators, with Eversource aiming to start construction by the end of 2026, Bruno said.

“What we’re witnessing is the birth of a new utility,” Magavi said. Geothermal networks “can help us address energy security, affordability and so many other challenges.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_Wiggs-_Geothermal_4-1024x606.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 13:02:00.271820

The Michigan Public Service Commission is planning on addressing the increasing amount of data centers in the state in a public hearing this week.

Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT, is opening a data center in Saline Township. Bridge Michigan recently reported there are nine other communities where companies have proposed building these large-scale data centers.

This surge is a result of a 2024 law that expanded the exemption from the state’s 6% sales tax purchases for the equipment inside these data centers. But despite economic opportunity, there is concern among residents. Questions about environmental impact came up when the legislature passed those bills.

The hearing is set for Dec. 3.

Detroit Mayor and gubernatorial candidate Mike Duggan is going to lose a huge asset in having the mayoral megaphone to command attention once Mayor-Elect Mary Sheffield takes office.

When random individual homeowners decide to electrify, a shrinking number of remaining gas customers have to pay to maintain the entire pipeline system.
“That’s a very unique business.” Liu is not exactly a known figure in the world of building electrification.
Learnings from those projects informed the development of New York’s statewide Clean Heat program, a partnership between utilities and the state that launched in 2020, offering rebates for heat pumps.
The company doesn’t sell the program to customers by talking about climate change or emissions.","If all goes well, after just a week or so of focused, frenzied work, the show arrives at the grand finale: the capping of the gas line.

Liu has staged this performance more than 25 times since 2023 as the implementation contractor for Electric Advantage, an incentive program in New York offered by the gas and electric utility Con Edison. The program covers 100% of the cost of replacing a building owner’s gas-powered appliances with electric versions, plus installing insulation and air sealing. Although it sounds too good to be true, there’s no catch — except that you have to be lucky enough to own a building that’s eligible for the program and agree to cut your gas connection.

ConEd, as it’s known, delivers natural gas to just over a million customers in the Bronx, Manhattan, Northern Queens, and Westchester County, and qualifies buildings for the program by first identifying sections of pipeline on the peripheries of its network that are due for replacement. Then it runs a cost-benefit analysis. If it would be cheaper to electrify all of the buildings served by a given stretch of gas main than to dig up the street and replace the pipe, the company starts going out to the homeowners and businesses along the line to gauge their interest. If the owners agree to go electric, that’s when Liu steps in.

There’s no established name for what Liu does. “It’s not a home improvement business, it’s not an energy efficiency business, it’s not an HVAC business,” she told me. “It’s about putting together a tight live production.” An apt title would be “electrification contractor” — one of the few, if not the only one of her kind operating in the New York area.

Anyone who has tried to electrify even just one appliance in their home has probably wished they could hire someone like Liu. Between finding an available and trustworthy contractor, navigating quotes and equipment choices, and managing ballooning costs, the process is often frustrating and confusing. It’s a major time commitment, not to mention a big capital investment — not a winning formula for mass adoption.

Liu doesn’t offer her services to just any homeowner, though. She only takes on jobs that come through contracts with utilities and government agencies like the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA. Having ConEd’s backing is actually one of the major benefits Liu brings to the work. It means she’s held to stringent standards of performance. Her business fronts the full cost of every Electric Advantage project, putting up tens of thousands of dollars for parts and labor, and only gets paid back by the utility after she demonstrates she’s met every requirement. Engineers check her design choices on the front end and the installations on the back end. A missing anti-tip bracket on a stove once almost cost her an entire $100,000 job, she told me.

Liu is the first to admit that all of this is a huge headache and a tough business model. She also fundamentally believes in this being utility-backed work. When a homeowner pursues a project on their own, the oversight is only as strong as their own ability to vet contractors and manage the job — which, with limited time, information, and leverage in the market, is likely not nearly as strong as Liu’s.

“My conviction is, for the middle class to thrive, we need to have a lot of things that are expensive to do and complex to do to become utilities,” Liu said. “That’s my hypothesis since I was 22.”

In the climate world, a lot of advocates and experts also believe that a utility-run program like Electric Advantage is the key to unlocking an all-electric future, although for slightly different reasons. When random individual homeowners decide to electrify, a shrinking number of remaining gas customers have to pay to maintain the entire pipeline system. If utilities instead strategically prune the gas system while helping customers go electric, the theory goes, it can reduce costs for remaining gas customers while also creating sustained demand for heat pump retrofits. This would help build the workforce necessary to perform them and create economies of scale.

The problem is, ConEd has 4,400 miles of gas mains. In just over two years of running Electric Advantage, the utility has retired about half of one mile. If the program, or similar ones at other New York utilities, were ever to scale from converting about a dozen buildings a year to taking on the whole state, it would need a lot more Julie Lius. ConEd has a small network of contractors who take on projects with more limited scopes, but Liu is the only one doing whole-home decarbonization.

“It’s high capex deployment of complex work in the field, and you have to have people who go into people’s homes and not piss them off,” said Liu. “That’s a very unique business.”

Liu is not exactly a known figure in the world of building electrification. She’s not on social media or otherwise broadcasting her accomplishments or policy views. You won’t find her headlining clean energy panels or on the boards of nonprofits. But Liu has been quietly leading building electrification in the New York area for nearly a decade. Her early belief in heat pumps and determination to bring them to the New York market helped lay the foundation for future programs in the state.

Long before all of this, Liu was a Taiwanese immigrant growing up in Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles. Her family moved to California from Taipei in 1983, just before she entered seventh grade. Liu told me she “did all the good, dutiful-daughter things.” Her family owned a small furniture manufacturing business, and she went to college at Carnegie Mellon for business and industrial design with the intention of helping her dad produce “more inspiring furniture than colonial reproductions.”

Then her education at Carnegie Mellon took her in a different direction. The programs were built around “productivity, process orientation, efficiency, build it cheaper, faster — it’s all about, can you get things done?” She developed an appreciation for utilities, in a broad sense — for how much of the economy was built around “serving more and more people at scale, and serving them better things.”

When she graduated in the mid-1990s, Liu broke the news to her parents that she wanted to get into telecommunications — the hot field at the time. She initially thought she wanted to work at the Federal Communications Commission, but some early mentors warned her that she wasn’t suited for government work and connected her with a job at DirectTV. “You’re too eager to get things done, you’ll be banging your head against the wall,” she recalled being told at the time. “Go to the private sector.”

She went on to spend the next 15-odd years working in satellite television in New York, with a brief interlude starting a software-as-a-service company with an ex-boyfriend that was a little too ahead of its time, according to Liu. She was successful in the industry, but she wasn’t very happy, she told me. She felt like she was “growing couch potatoes.”

By 2014, after a few zigs and zags — business school, a stint at an online real estate startup in Luxembourg — Liu found herself back in New York, unemployed, and spending a lot of her time trying to fix up the rat-infested Brooklyn brownstone she owned. The building had an oil-burning heating system that was draining her bank account. She wanted to install minisplit heat pumps, which were everywhere back in Taiwan, but at the time nobody was really doing that in New York.

In early 2016, still unemployed and living off savings and tenant rent, Liu reached out to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, to ask about incentives for minisplits, and got connected to a consulting firm called the Levy Partnership that was putting together a proposal for the agency’s first-ever heat pump pilot project. The company told her that brownstones were too difficult and expensive, though, and that it was planning to propose doing the pilot in just a couple of mobile homes on Long Island.

Liu was peeved. Statistically that wouldn’t have even constituted a demonstration, she told me. “That’s not even an alpha in the world of where I came from, satellite communications.” She made a bet with the firm. It was a Thursday. If she could get a bunch of her neighbors to sign letters of interest in the pilot by Monday, she told the company, then “you’re gonna copy and paste that trailer park proposal and say there’s gonna be one for brownstones.”

Needless to say, she got the letters. But Liu didn’t just get the Levy Partnership to expand its proposal or to include her brownstone in the pilot. She convinced it to hire her to help implement the projects. She had looked up the census data on home heating and saw that about half the boilers in the New York City area used expensive heating oil. “I was like, there’s the money,” she told me. She saw that people could lower their bills by switching to heat pumps, while also getting access to better cooling in the summertime. “The business opportunity was just like when I got into satellite, right? It was a transition,” she said.

A week after she and the firm co-submitted their proposal to NYSERDA, Liu incorporated her new company under the name Centsible House. (Her business now goes by the name Carta Electric Homes.) NYSERDA awarded the team the funding a few months later, and by March 2017 they were executing agreements with homeowners to participate. The pilot ran for two years and installed heat pumps in 20 homes throughout Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Long Island, including Liu’s brownstone. Learnings from those projects informed the development of New York’s statewide Clean Heat program, a partnership between utilities and the state that launched in 2020, offering rebates for heat pumps. Liu was “patient zero,” she told me.

After that, NYSERDA as well as ConEd and another local utility, National Grid, hired Liu for other demonstration projects and heat pump programs. She racked up more than a dozen trainings and certifications from the Building Performance Institute, the Environmental Protection Agency, and various equipment manufacturers, developing expertise in building envelopes, heat pumps, refrigerant systems, and health and safety.

In this piecemeal way, Liu created the job of the electrification contractor from the ground up. By the time ConEd was preparing to launch the Electric Advantage program, Liu had the only contracting business in the area that was essentially purpose-built to take it on.

On a recent Thursday morning in Croton, New York, a suburb of New York City, the show was behind schedule. Liu and I pulled up to a two-family house at the top of a hill to oversee what was supposed to be the “grand finale” day of an Electric Advantage-funded retrofit.

In this case, workers had already put in a new electrical panel, minisplit heat pumps, and a heat pump clothes dryer. Now, electricians would rewire the kitchens with 220-volt outlets for new induction stoves, while a father and son duo of plumbers would put heat pump water heaters in the basement, and a weatherization team would spray insulation around the perimeter of the basement roof and attic floor.

While still sitting in the driveway, Liu called PC Richard, the appliance store, to check on the stove delivery, but the sales rep on the other end was confused — she didn’t have anything scheduled. Liu kept her cool and worked it out, setting a new delivery date for the following day. She turned to me, with sympathy, to let me know this meant I wouldn’t get the denouement she had promised — the cutting and capping of the gas line. She made sure the plumbers could come back on Friday to finish the job.

The planning for this project began many months before, with a knock on the door from a man named Mark Brescia, who manages Electric Advantage for ConEd. Brescia does all the initial outreach, making house calls, phone calls, and sending emails, trying to sell homeowners on the idea. Part of the challenge is that in most cases, unless 100% of the buildings served by a given gas main agree to participate, the company can’t move forward because it won’t be able to retire the pipe. The majority of successful Electric Advantage projects to date have replaced gas mains that were serving a single building.

The company doesn’t sell the program to customers by talking about climate change or emissions. Instead, Brescia explains that the money that would have been spent digging up a gas pipeline could instead be used to buy them brand new appliances. “Customers are excited about the opportunity to make their everyday living more comfortable,” Brescia told me when I asked what the biggest selling point tended to be. They also “no longer worry about having to spend money to replace equipment when it fails.” If the building owner is interested, the next step is for them to schedule a visit from Liu, who does a site evaluation and budgets the job.

Survey data collected by ConEd shows that the most common reason customers decline to participate is a preference for gas cooking. The second is fear of higher electric bills. ConEd makes no guarantees to customers that their overall bills will go down if they participate, but by pairing the new appliances with air sealing and insulation, it tries to ensure the homes will run as efficiently as possible. Liu does her best to provide customer education, walking them through how to operate their heat pumps correctly — running the devices consistently, rather than turning them up and down or on and off, which uses more energy. Customers can also opt in to a special ConEd electricity rate that can save heat pump customers money if they run their systems this way.

“Many customers are still learning about the superior performance and convenience these technologies offer,” Brescia said. But there are also other bottlenecks to expanding the Electric Advantage program. Under New York law, if customers want to keep their gas service, ConEd must oblige them. So unless and until legislators change this “duty to serve,” the program will be hamstrung by customers who turn it down.

The program also currently only targets replacement of leak-prone “radial” mains — pipes that connect to the wider gas distribution system on just one end — as these can be removed without affecting system safety or reliability. The path to expanding it beyond these is uncertain because, as currently structured, that would start to put an untenable burden on customers.

Whether the money goes to a new gas main or a home electrification project, it comes from ConEd’s gas ratepayers through their bills. Whenever ConEd identifies a new batch of mains that meet the program’s specifications, it must submit a benefit-cost analysis to state regulators for approval to pursue the projects before it can begin reaching out to homeowners. In the most recent batch submitted to regulators, for example, replacing the 26 mains identified would have cost nearly $8 million, while the estimated cost of electrifying the buildings served was around $6 million, plus another $1 million in electric system upgrades. The latter is obviously a better deal for customers, even if, as an incentive, ConEd earns back part of the difference as a bonus — also paid for by customers.

Since gas customers pay for the program, it doesn’t totally solve the problem of a shrinking number of customers covering these major investments, even if they are spending less than they otherwise would. And once the most cost-effective projects get taken care of, the expense of electrification will be harder to justify.

Growing the program also depends on having more contractors like Liu to implement it, Brescia told me. Liu has a proven track record of coordinating multiple trades, upholding standards, and educating customers. “Delivering an exceptional customer experience is essential to building trust and driving widespread adoption of electric appliances,” he said.

Throughout the day that I spent with her, Liu vacillated over the question of whether she should or even could expand her business. Working alone enables her to keep costs down, she told me. “I cannot afford to hire additional people,” she said, “because every extra bit of cash flow I end up generating as a profit gets fed to more jobs” — that is, more electrification projects. She also doesn’t want to take on a bunch of high interest debt in order to front more capital to take on more projects.

At other points, she talked about scaling as both important and inevitable. She believes in whole-home electrification — both as a climate solution and as a way to change people’s lives for the better — and wants to see other entrepreneurs like her, especially women, be able to pursue this as a career. She already gets more job leads than she’s able to pursue. She’s starting to think about other fundraising options, such as finding private investors.

Liu also recently started working with a Columbia University masters student to develop software that would help manage and automate all of the “mind-numbing, insane amounts of reporting, submissions, and invoicing” she has to do. Although she already does all of the administrative work digitally, the process has only gotten more arduous as the various programs and companies she works with frequently change what and how she has to report back, whether due to shifting policies or just a round of McKinsey-ification. This is part of what prevents her from being able to take on more work, since all the bureaucratic overhead makes it harder for her to fully close a job and get paid.

Although it’s still very early in the process, her hope is that this kind of software solution could also make it easier for others to get into the field.

While there don’t appear to be any specific, imminent cyber or physical threats to the U.S. power grid, China has been seeking vulnerabilities in network systems to be used in future attacks, panelists said during a U.S. House of Representatives hearing Tuesday on threats to the U.S. energy system.

Volt Typhoon — a group believed to be run by the People’s Republic of China’s state security service — is focused on maintaining ongoing access to U.S. network systems for future potential disruptions, according to Michael Ball, CEO of the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center and senior vice president at the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

China is preparing for conflict over Taiwan, potentially in the “very near term,” and its strategy depends on preventing the United States from mounting a successful rescue mission, Harry Krejsa, director of Studies for the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology, said during the hearing held by the Energy and Commerce Committee’s energy subcommittee.

Part of China’s plan is to target U.S. civilian infrastructure to create panic and chaos, Krejsa said.

“Our aging infrastructure makes these threats easier, including in our energy ecosystem,” he said. “Today’s electricity grid is too often a hodgepodge of digital tools sitting atop an analog foundation, creating seams where adversaries can slip in.”

China is the most persistent cyber threat to the U.S., according to Zach Tudor, associate laboratory director for national and homeland security at the Idaho National Laboratory.

“Through Volt Typhoon, Salt Typhoon [and] Flax Typhoon, the Chinese Communist Party has embedded itself in our energy communications and water systems to set conditions for destructive attacks during the Pacific conflict over Taiwan,” he said. “They’re winning without fighting, attempting to undermine our infrastructure.”

Although no U.S. blackouts have been attributed to a cyberattack, “the threat landscape is dynamic and requires continuous vigilance,” Ball said.

Panelists called on Congress to expand programs and funding for cyber defense.

Congress should continue to fund information sharing collaboration initiatives, like the Energy Threat Analysis Center, a pilot initiative led by the Department of Energy that brings together power sector and federal officials, according to Sharla Artz, vice president for security and resilience policy at Xcel Energy.

“Expanding programs like [the Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program] enhances industry and government understanding of the threat landscape and thus needs additional government funding to accomplish that expansion,” said Artz, who represented the Edison Electric Institute at the hearing.

Tim Lindahl, president and CEO of Kenergy, a cooperative utility based in Henderson, Kentucky, urged Congress to reauthorize the $250 million Rural and Municipal Utility Cybersecurity Program, which runs through fiscal year 2026.

Lindahl called on DOE to disburse $80 million in RMUC awards that were announced last fall.

“With continued partnership and targeted federal investment, we can strengthen our defenses and ensure the security of the energy infrastructure that powers our nation,” said Lindahl, who spoke on behalf of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

NERC’s Ball urged Congress to reauthorize the expired Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 to support information sharing between the private sector and government.

During the hearing, Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said the Trump administration was undermining U.S. infrastructure protection efforts by cutting $5.6 billion in funding for state and local grid hardening and resiliency programs.

The administration also fired more than 1,000 cybersecurity and infrastructure agency staff, according to Menendez.

“A lack of public transportation options in South Jersey in particular was a major sore spot for folks,” McKoy said.","With a new governor poised to take the reins in January, a public policy group has issued a roadmap for New Jersey’s future, warning that runaway housing costs, public health and educational inequities, and public transportation gaps undermine the potential of many residents.

The Fund for New Jersey convened policy experts, community leaders, and residents for a series of conversations earlier this year to come up with the policy priorities released Wednesday.

Brandon McKoy, the nonprofit’s president, hopes policymakers at all levels, from Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill “down to the dog catcher,” regard the report’s recommendations as marching orders from New Jersey’s 9.5 million residents.

“We listened closely to what New Jerseyans told us,” McKoy said. “These recommendations reflect the priorities that surfaced repeatedly and the areas where leadership is needed most.”

McKoy’s group, which has provided two grants to the New Jersey Monitor, listed seven policy priorities they deemed most urgent:

Public health, climate, and the environment

Officials should step up ongoing efforts to eliminate lead exposure, which can cause developmental delays, behavioral changes, and other health harms, especially in children. As climate risks escalate and the clean-energy workforce expands, policymakers should create a statewide hub to train people for green jobs such as stormwater management and urban forestry.

Officials should revive a ban on trucks older than 2007 from ports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reduce diesel emissions in Newark, Elizabeth, and surrounding areas already disproportionately impacted by pollution.

Officials should do a cost-benefit analysis of beach replenishment projects, including climate change considerations. Such work has cost more than $3 billion in federal, state, and local tax funds, according to NJ.com. The feds typically foot the bulk of the bill, but the Trump administration has cut hundreds of millions in beach renewal funds this year.

“It is a losing proposition to keep spending taxpayer dollars to replace sand that washes away in extreme weather,” the report says.

Criminal justice reform

Officials can make the criminal justice system fairer by shortening the state’s speedy-trial timeline, in which defendants can languish for up to two years in prison waiting for their case to go to trial.

Rather than cracking down on low-level crimes like disorderly conduct, officials should divert such offenders to social services, sparing them convictions that later can block access to jobs, housing, and education, the report says.

They should also reduce barriers that threaten the successful reentry of people who leave prison. That could involve providing transitional housing, eliminating employment restrictions and driver’s license suspensions, and funding health care, educational, and vocational programs.

Allowing people with felony convictions to serve on juries also should be a priority, the report says. Excluding them separates them from a civic duty and keeps their lived experience out of jury deliberations.

Schools

The state should shift away from a census-based funding model to cover the cost of special education services. That model uses a statewide average to fund special education, leaving districts with more special-education students than average scrambling to close budget gaps.

The state also should spend more on higher education, with the broader goal of increasing the number of residents who earn college degrees. Gov. Phil Murphy cut more than $100 million from New Jersey’s colleges and universities in the current budget. That means New Jersey’s already expensive institutions could hike tuition to make up the loss, leaving degrees out of reach for low- and middle-income students, according to the report.

Already, fewer than half — about 43% — of New Jersey residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, the report says. And thousands of college students take longer than four years to complete a degree, adding to their debt burden.

Affordable housing

McKoy’s group recommends reestablishing the state public advocate’s office, a watchdog former Gov. Chris Christie abolished in 2010, and making fair housing one of its key mandates.

Christie also dissolved the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission in 2015 by merging it with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The commission had used regional tax-base sharing, which enabled 14 towns to share the costs and benefits of development. McKoy’s group recommends restoring the commission as an independent agency, as well as its tax-base-sharing, to ensure stronger enforcement of environmental standards.

Enacting statewide rent controls and growing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund also should be priorities for policymakers.

Jobs and the economy

The state should repeal the New Jersey Parking Offenses Adjudication Act, which enables officials to suspend the driver’s license or vehicle registration of people who don’t pay parking fines. That disproportionately impacts lower-income residents, who may be unable to afford parking fines. Losing their license or registration could threaten their jobs, so New Jersey should follow the lead of states including Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Illinois, where lawmakers ended license suspensions over most non-moving violations.

New Jersey’s unemployment rate is higher than the national average. And 9% of residents age 25 to 64 don’t have a high school diploma or general-equivalency degree — the minimum requirement for many jobs, according to the Kids Count Data Center. Those trends show that the state should provide more and better education and vocational training.

Making child care more affordable would help, the report says. While the state has expanded free preschool, universal child care is “vital for helping families succeed,” McKoy said.

“It’s really becoming a major, major crisis that’s preventing families from being able to be economically stable, let alone successful,” he said.

The report also recommends that New Jersey establish a guaranteed basic income, in which low-income families could count on state support for their essential needs.

“It is a crucial safety net addition for today’s economy, where full-time work does not guarantee financial stability,” the report says.

Baby bonds also would help erase disparities by giving low-income infants a savings endowment they can access at age 18.

The state’s fiscal responsibility

The record $58.8 billion budget state lawmakers approved in June contained controversial cuts, diversions, and funding freezes on affordable housing, child care, and opioid settlement funds, among other things, that left angry advocates demanding reversals. At the same time, lawmakers tacked on more than $700 million in last-minute pet projects critics have condemned as pork.

“Budgets are statements of decisions, and every budget has things in it that I would say are driving towards community benefit, and unfortunately, some things that are not,” McKoy said.

To ensure better fiscal responsibility, the fund recommended that officials review and reduce the tax breaks the state has increasingly given out to lure businesses to New Jersey.

“The effectiveness of this strategy is being questioned. At present, New Jersey does not monitor tax expenditures closely to control their growth and to determine whether they deliver their intended economic benefits,” the report notes.

New Jersey also must restore its “rainy day” reserves, which are meant to cover state operations during emergencies. The state now ranks last in the nation, with just enough money in its rainy day fund to cover two days of operations; Wyoming, in comparison, leads the nation, with enough in its reserves to run the state for 302 days, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

Public transit

Public transit agencies in other states can rely on regular operating funds from the state. NJ Transit’s funding, though, is marked by “constant scarcity and instability,” the report says.

The agency consequently diverts $400 million annually in federal transit dollars meant for capital improvements to cover budget shortfalls, which contributes to chronic service disruptions, according to the report. Establishing a stable and permanent state funding allocation would improve service.

The group also called on NJ Transit, the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, and the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization to work together to conduct long-range planning.

“A lack of public transportation options in South Jersey in particular was a major sore spot for folks,” McKoy said. “Not only will that help folks have different ways of getting around, but also alleviate traffic on the road.”

Other emerging issues

The report listed several other “emerging” priorities, including expanding government oversight and accountability.

Eliminating or weakening government watchdogs leaves public programs and systems vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse, the report says.

McKoy pointed to lawmakers’ current effort to strip the state comptroller’s office of its investigative powers. Such an effort goes against what his group heard during their community conversations, he said.

“Folks want to know that the government is properly spending public money and also cracking down on fraud, waste, and abuse,” McKoy said. “They talk about the state being expensive and needing to do a better job of officially using funds. So we need to actually invest more in these offices that are providing oversight of government processes.”

The report recommends making the state comptroller an independent position, rather than one appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate approval; reestablishing the state Office of the Public Advocate to give residents a stronger voice in holding government accountable; and expanding the Open Public Records Act to reduce exemptions that allow officials to keep records secret. Lawmakers last year instead added new restrictions to public records.

Policymakers also should embrace policies that support immigrants, who comprise 29% of New Jersey’s working population, the report says. Strategies could include boosting funding to the state Office of New Americans and creating pathways for immigrants to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities.

The report urges policymakers to expand access to voting by passing same-day voter registration and a Voting Rights Act.

McKoy’s group also implored officials to get an early start on ensuring the state’s population is correctly counted in the 2030 Census. Federal officials use census data to determine federal funding, so an accurate count is especially important as states endure unprecedented cuts made by the Trump administration, McKoy added.

“The census is the biggest non-wartime effort in the history of the nation, so it requires a lot of forethought,” he said. “Making sure we do a good job on the Census is actually really crucial over these next couple of years to make sure that we are getting all of our federal funds possible.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0199_1-2048x1394.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 12:00:53.786931

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Approximately $3.6 billion in delayed funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, was released Friday to states and tribes, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

The federal funding for LIHEAP, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes, has been held up during the beginning of the cold-weather season because of the federal government shutdown, which ended Nov. 12.

“This release of LIHEAP funding is essential and long overdue,” Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement. “Families can finally begin receiving the support they need to keep the heat on as winter begins.”

States typically receive their allocations at the beginning of November.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, has not yet issued a formal public announcement about resumption of the funding. After the federal shutdown ended, HHS said one of its agencies would “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” blaming the delay on congressional Democrats.

Wolfe said state agencies told his organization they’ve received award letters from HHS, enabling them to begin distributing assistance to households.

A message was left seeking comment with HHS.

On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. House members sent a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to release the LIHEAP funds by Nov. 30. Given the heating season has already started in many parts of the U.S., they said “there is no time to waste,” especially for households that use home heating oil or propane. Those fuels typically aren’t affected by state moratoriums on utility shutoffs during the winter months.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25325014112956.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 12:01:18.287447

The researchers at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, writing in the journal Nature in 2024, had forecast a 19% drop in global income by 2050. Their revised analysis puts the figure at 17%.

The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.

The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.

The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.

Max Kotz, one of the study’s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet's warming.

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School who wasn't involved with the research, said the thrust of the Potsdam Institute's work remains the same “no matter which part of the range the true figure will be.”

“Climate change already hits home, quite literally. Home insurance premiums across the U.S. have already seen, in part, a doubling over the past decade alone,” Wagner said. “Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.”

Similar concerns could well arise in energy regulation.
He goes on to cite Scotland’s water sector as a place where this is done well.
Either way, could similar changes help the energy sector?
The Independent Water Commission’s report is more than a ‘blueprint’ for the water sector: it’s a signal to all UK infrastructure regulators that significant reform could occur if public policy issues are not adequately addressed.","In July 2025 the Independent Water Commission delivered its final report calling for a single, integrated water regulator for England – merging Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, and water-environment functions from the Environment Agency and Natural England, with tailored arrangements for Wales. The aim: restore public trust, enable long-term investment, and deliver environmental outcomes through a clearer, less fragmented regime.

This shake-up in the water sector, with what some would see as quite radical reforms – followed by Ofwat Chief Executive David Black stepping down in August 2025 – is about more than clean rivers and efficient investment in critical infrastructure. It’s a warning bell to what reform might bring if a sector like water fails to deliver what is expected by society and the media.

Just as the Commission proposes breaking down silos in water regulation, achieving net zero will require integrated oversight, adaptive price controls, and regulators with the commitment, skills, resourcing, and mandate to manage cross-sector, system-wide transitions.

Infrastructure is the circulatory system that keeps society functioning – access to affordable, reliable, and resilient water, energy, transport, communication, and waste services is essential for health, productivity, and growth, for individuals and the UK’s economy. But these systems face mounting pressures, evidence by:

Environmental performance gaps: in 2023, UK water companies discharged sewage into rivers and seas over 300,000 times, and pollution incidents are on an upward trend.

Infrastructure bottlenecks: new grid connections for renewable energy projects have faced delays of up to a decade.

These are not abstract issues: the UK’s legally binding target requires national greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to net zero by 2050, and 2030 is the decisive decade. By 2035 the UK must deliver a fully decarbonised power sector, achieve the Sixth Carbon Budget emissions pathway, and meet statutory water sector resilience and leakage targets.

This is not simply a technical delivery challenge – it is also cultural and attitudinal, taking place in contested spaces where privately operated entities exist to serve public needs.

When regulatory culture fosters trust, clarity, and partnership, investment and innovation follow. When it lapses into mistrust or overly rigid control, it can stifle initiative and delay essential investment.

This means infrastructure companies, and their owners, must act to decarbonise, adapt, and expand within tight timeframes, and regulators must enable, not hinder this transformation.

Yet achieving this will require more than better regulation – it will demand breakthrough thinking from all actors. As Paul Hawken and the UN Global Compact’s Project Breakthrough note, genuine breakthroughs occur when institutions shift from incremental efficiency to transformative outcomes – aligning governance, investment, and innovation toward shared goals.

Regulators influence company behaviour through the application of regulatory frameworks: the combination of price controls, performance targets, and incentives that set the commercial conditions for investment.

UK infrastructure regulation was shaped by the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s, anchored in the so-called RPI-X model: prices could only rise by the Retail Price Index minus an efficiency factor (X), incentivising productivity without compromising service quality.

This model, first applied in the privatisation of British Telecom, was built for stable, low-risk sectors, not for infrastructure undergoing climate-driven transformation. The early emphasis was on driving out inefficiency and lowering costs to consumers, with regulators acting as arm’s-length economic ‘referees’ rather than strategic partners in system change.

While this approach delivered cost efficiency, it was premised on utilities as stable, low-risk businesses.

The RIIO model, introduced in the mid-2010s by Ofgem, linked revenue to incentives, innovation, and specified outputs. In water, periodic price reviews set investment allowances and service targets over five years based on a RIIO type approach.

Regulation through RPI-X and RIIO approaches have had a short-term focus (in the context of very long-lived assets) and the design of UK regulatory cycles – typically five years – can entrench short-term decision-making. Companies naturally plan around these windows, leading to bursts of investment just before the review ends, or risk-averse deferral of innovative projects.

In energy, grid connection delays and backlog costs are a clear symptom of long-term needs being stifled and subordinated to annual or five-year planning cycle logic.

While these frameworks were designed to continue to deliver improved efficiency and the delivery of customer centric outcomes, they were not designed for a world with climate change, technological disruption, and the investment levels required by the net zero transition.

The National Audit Office commented on gaps in the conduct of regulation – such as Ofwat’s limited insight into the condition of water and wastewater assets – which constrain its ability to ensure adequate investment. Similar concerns could well arise in energy regulation.

Capability is not about capacity. It’s about having the skills, data, and decision-making agility to manage “radical uncertainty”: the reality that future demand, technology costs, and climate impacts cannot be predicted with precision.

In this environment, rigid rulebooks can create perverse outcomes, while adaptive frameworks can keep the system on track.

Regulatory offices have expanded significantly in size – with Ofgem staff numbers increasing from 300 in 2001-02 to 1,800 and Ofwat’s staff numbers increasing from 219 to 322 over the same time period. This has led to a bureaucratization of regulation, and a pursuit of illusory precision to get the ‘right, objective’ answer based on an outdated economic model.

The key to capability is about understanding how companies respond to incentives put in place and building trust that ensures that private companies deliver public outcomes.

Oxford emeritus professor Colin Mayer is critical of regulatory systems which create a “…conflict between private companies with a primary interest in profit and regulators concerned about the public interest of customers and communities.”

What is required, he states, is the need for ‘purposeful regulation’ that would endeavor to tackle some of the behavioral weaknesses and lack of trust that are clear to see in current regulatory frameworks. He goes on to cite Scotland’s water sector as a place where this is done well.

The Independent Water Commission’s proposal for an integrated regulator is, in effect, a sector-specific ‘uber regulator'. The logic seems to be one of seeking control to cope with the current model of fragmented oversight, which makes it harder to manage systemic risks and optimise investment.

The Cunliffe review cannot be faulted for its comprehensive nature with its 88 extensive recommendations covering a wide range of issues from strategic direction, planning and the legislative framework to detailed regulatory reform, but the nature of the changes is a huge departure from the model of an independent regulator.

There is a real question as to whether changes of this scale can be made to work. It remains to be seen whether merging two underperforming regulators (Ofwat and the Environment Agency) with the Drinking Water Inspectorate can deliver meaningful change, given the risks of added bureaucracy and challenges in securing sufficient expertise.

One also needs to consider the transfer of risk from private companies to the regulator that the review is in essence proposing through its supervisory model. Whether this proves to be an approach that stifles necessary innovation only time will tell.

There are a significant number of recommendations on the legal and policy framework in the Cunliffe review, where parallels with energy can be drawn.

This begs two questions:

Is there a systematic problem with the RIIO type framework itself (that the Cunliffe review seems to be pointing to) or is it simply that Ofwat has not operated it well?

Either way, could similar changes help the energy sector?

One of the most notable suggestions in the review is for a comprehensive planning framework with the establishment of regional catchment-based system planners and a “light national water systems planning coordination function”.

There is a clear read across here to the establishment of the National Energy System Operator (NESO) in energy who have responsibility for developing Regional Energy System Plans as well as national plans. This model of course is still in its infancy in energy, but at least proactively seeks to tackle coordination issues.

There are also several recommendations relating to regulatory methodology – an area where the water and network element of energy regulation share very similar RIIO-based regulatory frameworks.

The review is critical of and provides recommendations in a number of these areas including:

ceasing the use of totex as a concept

removing incentives for good business plans

placing less reliance on technical econometric modelling for determining costs

rationalizing the overall number of performance commitments and associated incentives

These changes would be quite a big departure for Ofgem if applied in energy too.

To deliver net zero we have a number of the right systems and tools - such as the NESO - but there is a need to more fully consider whether we have the right regulatory framework in place.

In a welcome move, Ofgem developed a set of regulatory 'archetypes’ which it consulted on before its RIIO-3 price reviews for gas and energy sectors, including traditional ex ante type approaches based on RIIO five yearly price reviews.

They are nevertheless reluctant to move away from this regulatory approach to a more ‘rate of return’ type approach (its so-called ‘freedom and accountability’ archetype) – and are more inclined towards moving to the ‘plan and deliver’ archetype at least for electricity transmission and distribution.

Perhaps the time is now right to make a bolder shift to better align the motives and interests of regulators and companies.

RIIO was introduced following Ofgem’s RIIO@20 review launched in March 2008 – after twenty years of RPI-X regulation – and has now been in place for well over 15 years. So, arguably the time is right for a comprehensive review and reset.

There is much for the Government to consider from the Cunliffe review in relation to the water sector, but we should not fail to read across to what this could mean for the energy sector too. The real challenge is to develop regulatory institutions, methodologies and a culture that creates ‘purposeful regulation’, and a stable consistent framework for investment.

The Independent Water Commission’s report is more than a ‘blueprint’ for the water sector: it’s a signal to all UK infrastructure regulators that significant reform could occur if public policy issues are not adequately addressed.

For investors, stable and climate-aligned regulatory frameworks are the foundation for unlocking the billions needed to upgrade and decarbonise the UK’s infrastructure.

For society, they are the guarantee that services remain affordable, resilient, and equitable.

And for the global economy, the UK’s position as a financial and regulatory leader means its example can shape how capital flows to climate-critical infrastructure worldwide.

But capability now means more than technical competence: it demands broader ability to mobilise rapid, system-wide progress toward net zero while maintaining legitimacy and trust.

The decisive years to 2030 will determine whether the UK can deliver affordable, enduring, investable infrastructure fit for a low-carbon economy. Investing in regulatory capability is investing in this delivery.",https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-12/Water_pipe_pollution_AdobeStock_180516796.jpeg,N,,2025-12-03 16:02:15.401632

Still, the Trump administration is moving forward with the RIFs at State.
Impacted employees received a message this week stating that they would be separated on Dec. 5.
In August, as the FSOs awaited their official terminations, many of those impacted by RIFs received promotions.
The following day, SBA sent a new message to the roughly 75 impacted employees saying the RIFs were back on and they should ignore the previous communication.","Updated Dec. 3 at 10:50 a.m.

The State Department will finalize its layoffs of 250 foreign service officers on Friday, according to a new notice sent to impacted staff, despite a congressionally mandated moratorium on the cuts through January.

State announced sent reduction-in-force notices to 1,350 employees in July. Most of those workers were civil servants who were terminated in September. Those in the foreign service, however, were required to receive 120 days notice, meaning they were due for dismissal in November. Due to the government shutdown and a court order pausing federal layoffs, those cuts did not move forward at that time.

The shutdown ended when President Trump signed into law a measure extending funding through January for most agencies, which also banned the administration from taking any action to execute a RIF.

“No federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the federal government” for the duration of the spending law, the continuing resolution ordered.

Still, the Trump administration is moving forward with the RIFs at State. Impacted employees received a message this week stating that they would be separated on Dec. 5. State said its Office of Legal Adviser made the decision after receiving “formal written guidance from both the Office of Management and Budget and Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.”

The layoffs, State said, do not violate the language of the recently passed spending bill because the RIF notices were sent prior to the shutdown. Federal News Network first reported the new layoff date.

The Trump administration has rescinded RIF notices sent to nearly 4,000 employees during the shutdown, but is moving forward with those that initially preceded the funding lapse.

One soon-to-be former foreign service officer, a former attorney, called the administration’s legal argument “absolute BS.”

“They are moving quickly and basically saying, ‘Sue us,’” the employee said, adding that impacted staff are speaking to legal counsel and talking to lawmakers’ offices.

A State spokesperson said the RIFs will ""proceed as planned.

“Since the State Department’s lawful RIF process was commenced and initiated well before the lapse in appropriations, the eliminated positions are not impacted by the language in the recent Continuing Resolution,"" the spokesperson said.

The American Foreign Service Association said on Tuesday the administration’s legal interpretations cannot change what is plainly written in law and vowed to pursue legal action.

“This action flies in the face of the current funding law, which clearly prohibits using any federal resources to carry out layoffs during this period,” AFSA said. “That includes sending notices, processing paperwork, or taking any step to advance these separations.”

The legally dubious layoff date marks the latest in the whirlwind of State’s RIF process. After sending the notices, citing bureaucratic bloat, it began onboarding new officers in September. In August, as the FSOs awaited their official terminations, many of those impacted by RIFs received promotions.

Other agencies have also proceeded with layoffs despite the spending law’s prohibition. The Small Business Administration originally sent RIF notices to around 75 employees in April and after a series of delays was set to separate them in October. After further delay due to the shutdown, SBA last month sent the employees an updated message saying the layoffs were canceled due to the CR. The following day, SBA sent a new message to the roughly 75 impacted employees saying the RIFs were back on and they should ignore the previous communication. Both notices were obtained by Government Executive.

OMB and Justice originally told SBA it had to rescind the RIFs, according to an employee briefed on the matter, but the following day the Office of Personnel Management intervened and said the CR was not intended to interfere with SBA’s layoffs and the agency should move forward. The employees were officially separated from the agency, retroactive to Oct. 29.

The General Services Administration is also proceeding with RIFs it first noticed prior to the shutdown but which took effect after it ended, as first reported by The New York Times.

Nextpower is growing its presence in Tennessee. The company just unveiled an expanded Southeast regional hub with a new remote monitoring center in Nashville, alongside a major expansion of its U.S. steel fabrication capacity in the region.

“The Southeast has entered a new era of energy infrastructure,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextpower, formerly Nextracker. “This new U.S. manufacturing line with our partner MSS not only doubles our Memphis factory production capacity for solar trackers, but it also helps our customers scale projects faster, brings new American jobs, and strengthens our supply chain.”

The addition of a new fabrication line, operated by MSS Steel Tubes USA based in Memphis, Tennessee, will double Nextpower’s manufacturing capacity with MSS for solar tracker systems used in utility-scale power plants across the Southeast. The existing steel fabrication line at the facility currently supports 120 skilled U.S. jobs, with 150 expected as the new line ramps up.

“We’re proud to have built a lasting and trusted partnership with Nextpower, one grounded in shared values of quality and innovation,” said António Pedro Antunes, CEO of Metalogalva Group, parent company of MSS. “Together, we’ve firmly established production capacity here in Tennessee to serve the growing demand for solar power infrastructure across the Southeastern United States.”

Supporting solar growth in the Southeast

According to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Southeast added 5 GW of solar in 2024 alone, pushing total capacity to nearly 28 GW, and is on track to nearly double that total to 54 GW by 2030. Nextpower’s fabrication capacity will support utility-scale solar power plants across Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Virginia — many of which are developed, owned, and operated by Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch Corp., one of the largest independent power producers in the country.

“In our first 15 years, Silicon Ranch installed more than 4 GW of solar energy capacity, one of the largest operating fleets in the United States, and we will double that figure over the next three years,” said Reagan Farr, Silicon Ranch co-founder and CEO. “Nextpower’s expansion in Tennessee helps us do so while enabling us to support additional investments in domestic manufacturing; this is what ‘unleashing American energy’ looks like.”

Shugar added, “Silicon Ranch pioneered utility-scale solar in the Southeast and continues to lead the way in delivering high quality projects that serve the region’s increasing demand for electricity.”

To celebrate economic growth in the Southeast and its expansion, Nextpower will host a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its new Nashville office, featuring Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, executives from Silicon Ranch and MSS Steel Tubes, representatives from major U.S. steel suppliers, and officials from the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The event includes guided tours of Nextpower’s new Remote Monitoring Center, which connects Nashville-based engineers to Nextpower solar tracker projects around the world.

“Nextpower’s expansion is a powerful example of the innovation and economic momentum taking place across Tennessee,” said Josh Brown, president and CEO of the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “This investment supports new jobs, deepens our state’s manufacturing capabilities, and positions Tennessee to remain a national leader as demand for clean energy and advanced infrastructure accelerates.”

News Release

EIR forecasts modest impact on U.S. natural gas demand from data center expansion

Report highlights grid-connected data centers limit natural gas consumption due to grids having mixed generation sources, while behind-the-meter projects offer a more certain path to higher gas demand

CALGARY, Alberta (Dec. 3, 2025) Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, the most trusted energy SaaS company that leverages generative AI across its solutions, is releasing a new analysis forecasting U.S. data center load growth and its implications for natural gas demand through 2030.

EIR projects 30 gigawatts (GW) of new U.S. data center capacity over the next five years—significantly below the 50 GW forecasted by major grid operators. This more conservative outlook reflects the impact of stricter utility requirements, which have already reduced speculative project proposals by more than 50% in states such as Ohio.

“Our research shows that while data center expansion will drive substantial energy demand, it will have a marginal impact on natural gas in the immediate years,” said Jimmy McNamara, CFA, principal analyst at EIR. “By focusing on confirmed projects and real-world constraints, we provide a more accurate outlook for both the power and natural gas sectors.”

Key takeaways:

EIR forecasts 30 GW of new U.S. data center capacity by 2030, compared to 50 GW projected by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and PJM Interconnection (PJM).

Recent policy changes in states like Ohio, including higher power costs and stricter credit requirements, led to a 15 GW (over 50%) drop in proposed data center projects.

If all new capacity were gas-fired, it could add up to 4.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of incremental Lower 48 natural gas demand by 2030; however, gas growth will be lower as grid-connected data centers use mixed generation sources. EIR is more confident in 2.1 Bcf/d of growth from behind-the-meter projects with dedicated gas generation.

For example, a 1 GW data center uses approximately 140 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas, less than 1% of Appalachia’s daily production.

EIR’s analysis pulls from a variety of products including Enverus PRISM®, Enverus FOUNDATIONS® and Enverus Mosaic.

Santee Cooper received unanimous approval Tuesday to borrow up to $700 million total for three separate projects, with $120 million of that for the new build in Colleton County.

But first, legislators on the Joint Bond Review Committee had questions about its growing price tag and what that might mean for power customers.

State-owned Santee Cooper and Virginia-headquartered Dominion have agreed to partner on a 2,200-megawatt power plant on the site of a former coal plant along the Edisto River near Canadys.

The power companies now estimate the cost of that plant at $5 billion — up from a $2.5 billion told to senators last August.

That early estimate was based on historical costs to build similar units. But prices have increased dramatically since then as utility companies globally rush to build similar plants, said Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton.

Here’s what SC landowners should expect from a proposed 71-mile natural gas pipeline

The sticker shock had some legislators questioning whether a gas plant was still the best choice for meeting the state’s growing power needs.

Rep. Leon Stavrinakis raised concerns over whether the same demand driving up the cost of the plant’s turbines would also make the gas needed to run them more expensive.

“If everybody is going to be drawing on that same power source, it seems logical to me that that power source is going to get more expensive,” the Charleston Democrat said.

Stavrinakis went on to say the rising cost of electricity is becoming too much for residents who need it to keep the lights on in their homes and small businesses.

“My constituents, I’m going to be honest with you, can’t afford any more rate increases,” he said. “People are hurting.”

Staton acknowledged the price of natural gas has gone up in the past year and a half as the United States has started to export more to other countries.

The U.S. is the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas, and gas exports have tripled in the past five years. By 2030, it will double again, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Energy published in December 2024.

Meanwhile, use of natural gas in the U.S. is expected to hit a new record this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

However, Staton said, the cost of other fuels has been on the rise as well. He said coal prices, for example, are two to three times higher than they were four years ago.

Staton said Santee Cooper has accounted for a potential increase in natural gas prices as part of its long-term plans.

“And in every case, what we find, is this: These are still the best dispatchable resources for us to invest in,” he said of the gas-fired power plants.

Santee Cooper will start by spending $120 million for its share of equipment costs at Canadys.

How much customers ultimately will pay on their monthly power bills for the new gas plant remains to be seen. But Staton told legislators he expects any price increases to match the general rate of inflation.

The power companies still need the permission of state regulators before it can begin construction. Staton said Santee Cooper and Dominion plans to file that application on Dec. 15.

Legislators also signed off on spending related to two other natural gas-related projects: nearly $300 million for a pair of natural gas turbines on the site of an existing coal plant near Georgetown and more than $270 million for the expansion of an existing natural gas plant.

The coal plant, Winyah, came online in 1975 and Santee Cooper plans to close it down within the next decade.

There’s already gas pipelines and power lines that run to the Winyah plant, Staton said, making it an ideal location for the gas turbines and providing a potential future use for the site.

The small turbines will produce about 100 megawatts of electricity and Santee Cooper can fire them up quickly at the time of day when power usage is at its highest.

They would also work well with solar power, Santee Cooper spokeswoman Mollie Gore said, because they can be turned on on days when the sun isn’t shining.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dsc_0320-1024x6831764788527.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=Pzg45iqU,N,,2025-12-03 14:06:06.839295

“By offering free service line identification and replacement, we are eliminating one of the biggest hurdles families face in protecting their home’s plumbing,” said Timothy Mitchell, Director of Lynchburg Water Resources.","Affected customers will receive notifications by mail in December 2025.

Lynchburg Water Resources (LWR) recently launched Pure Pipe Lynchburg, a multi-year initiative designed to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s lead and copper compliance regulations. The federal mandates, which were first introduced in 2021, require all water utilities in the country to develop a complete inventory of water service line materials in their respective water distribution systems and to remove all lead service lines by 2037.

The City’s initial inventory was successfully submitted to the Virginia Department of Health and published on the City’s website in 2024, and required notifications were mailed to customers believed to have lead, galvanized (if downstream of lead) and unknown water service line materials. Starting this week, a second round of required notifications are being mailed to customers with lead, galvanized and unknown service lines – a process that will continue annually until all service lines in Lynchburg have been verified to be non-lead.

As part of the City’s commitment to safeguarding public health, LWR’s Pure Pipe Lynchburg program is offering comprehensive support to customers by assisting with water service line identification and replacement. Residents who receive a notification of unknown service line material are being asked to complete an online survey about their pipe material or request assistance from the City. Residents who receive a notification of a lead or “galvanized requiring replacement” (GRR) service line will be provided information about the City’s replacement program.

“By offering free service line identification and replacement, we are eliminating one of the biggest hurdles families face in protecting their home’s plumbing,” said Timothy Mitchell, Director of Lynchburg Water Resources. “Each household’s participation helps move us closer to eliminating any remaining lead service lines in the water delivery system.”

To encourage participation in the program, the City is providing residents with an extensive suite of tools through the dedicated Pure Pipe Lynchburg webpage at www.lynchburgva.gov/purepipe.

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-canceled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”",https://i0.wp.com/wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/President-Bush-with-corn.jpg?fit=1200%2C842&quality=100&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-03 11:07:28.157260

The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.

The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.

The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.

Max Kotz, one of the study’s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet’s warming.

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School who wasn’t involved with the research, said the thrust of the Potsdam Institute’s work remains the same “no matter which part of the range the true figure will be.”

“Climate change already hits home, quite literally. Home insurance premiums across the U.S. have already seen, in part, a doubling over the past decade alone,” Wagner said. “Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.”

Rising production from OPEC and its allies around the globe has helped to drive down crude oil prices, which in turn provide relief for Americans at the pump. AAA reported Tuesday that the average price for regular U.S. gasoline was $2.998 per gallon.

“U.S. oil producers do continue to slowly increase oil production,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis with the GasBuddy fuel-price-tracking service. “But the bigger story here really has to do with OPEC.”

Members of the cartel have been squabbling, he said. Yet the group known as OPEC+ has agreed to increase production for December, following other increases this year.

AAA said Monday that the U.S. gasoline average was just over $3 a gallon before reporting Tuesday that it had dropped below that threshold. The average hadn’t been that low since May 2021, said AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz.

While details of gasoline price reports vary, the Trump administration is eager to point to lower fuel costs as it remains under pressure to address higher prices in other areas of the economy, from beef to electricity.

President Donald Trump sought to claim credit for the drop as he spoke to reporters during his Cabinet meeting Tuesday. He predicted that pump prices will keep dropping.

“We’re down at about $2.50 a gallon,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to get down to $2. We could crack that at some point.”

The president has also frequently touted the administration’s pro-drilling policies.

Prices vary widely by state because of different levies and gasoline infrastructure. Oklahoma’s average was just over $2.40 a gallon, AAA said Tuesday, while California was at $4.54 per gallon.

AAA’s highest recorded average price of $5.016 per gallon for regular U.S. gasoline came on June 14, 2022, during the administration of former President Joe Biden. It came the same year that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

But the average U.S. price a year ago was just $3.047, AAA said Tuesday, or about a nickel more than the new $2.998 average. GasBuddy reported recently that “a few dozen stations” in the country have been selling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, told Trump during Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting that prices were down because of Trump himself.

“The biggest determinant of the price of energy is politicians, political leaders and policies — that’s what drives energy prices,” Wright said. “There are a number of stations in the heartland of America with $1.99 signs flying today.”

But De Haan said geopolitics are driving the market, not U.S. politics.

“OPEC is sick of ceding market share to U.S. and Canadian producers,” he said. “It’s all pretty much additional supply, right? It’s not additional supply from the United States. It’s additional supply being added to the world by OPEC.”

‘Downward pressure’

Trump has pushed for aggressive oil and gas development, clearing away regulations that crimp petroleum profits while going out of his way to block the wind and solar projects favored by Biden.

The United States became known as the largest oil producer in the world during Trump’s first term in office, and the increase continued for Biden’s four years. The latest U.S. Energy Information Administration production number, 13.84 million barrels per day in September, once again set a new record.

Parents watching the price of toys rise as Christmas approaches may be taking comfort in lower gasoline prices, though some people in the oil industry have been growing unhappy with the direction of oil prices.

They’ve watched the price of oil drop as Trump’s tariffs drive up the cost of steel and other supplies. West Texas Intermediate oil, a U.S. benchmark, settled Tuesday for less than $59 a barrel. That is below break-even prices in the range of $62 to $64 per barrel for parts of the prolific Permian Basin, as noted by EIA and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

EIA has said global Brent oil prices could average well below that range in 2026.

While production has been increasing for years, oil companies say continued low prices are causing them to start cutting back.

“The downward pressure on oil prices coupled with continued tightness in finding qualified labor in remote locations continues to pressure profitability and dividends,” an unnamed oil industry executive wrote in response to third-quarter energy questions from the Dallas Fed.

“Right now we are bleeding,” said another executive.

Beyond OPEC+ decisions, other factors have contributed to the drop in gasoline prices, such as refineries coming back online after maintenance. EIA has noted that prices often drop in winter as people drive less and environmental regulations no longer require the use of more expensive summer-grade gasoline in some areas.

Oil inventories have been growing globally and in the United States, and EIA expects them to keep rising through 2026, which puts more downward pressure on prices. OPEC+ countries may not continue production increases next year.

More broadly, De Haan said, the oil market is starting to balance out from the twin shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic that sent prices plunging and Russia’s ground war against Ukraine that sent prices surging.

“The Federal Reserve has been doing its job, trying to rein in inflation by making borrowing more expensive,” he said.

“U.S. consumers have slowed down their consumption. And various central banks worldwide have been fighting inflation, too,” De Haan added. “So, everyone’s been doing their part to slow down not only the U.S. economy, but the global economy, so that today’s supply is better matching demand.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/5c/b1/c5b0d5c2490699d8972b8ad82cad/us-extreme-weather-illinois-47592.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 11:09:01.405814

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90m acres – about the size of Montana – and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that the US’s obsession with corn has a steep price: the fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when the nitrogen in the fertilizer breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol – which now consumes 40% of the US corn crop – is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Industry is also pushing for ethanol-based jet fuel and higher-ethanol gasoline blends as growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of US greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide – making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

Since 2000, US corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

The environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy – and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), passed in the mid-2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn”, demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50bn in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps – such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in cornfields – could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: if the US’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it in a different way?

How corn took over the US

In the late 1990s, the US’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom”.

Corn production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of the US’s corn crop into ethanol.

In 2001, the US Department of Agriculture launched the bioenergy program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 farm bill created programs supporting ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon mounted an all-out campaign to persuade Congress to require that gasoline be blended with ethanol, arguing it cut greenhouse gasses, reduced oil dependence and revived rural economies.

“I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying: ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you,’” Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, said in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

In 2005, Congress created the RFS, which requires adding ethanol to gasoline, and expanded it two years later. The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, was more land cleared to grow corn. The Global Carbon Project found that nitrous oxide emissions from human activity rose 40% from 1980 to 2020.

In the United States, “king corn” became a political force. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55m on lobbying and millions more on political donations to Democrats and Republicans alike, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Now the sectors are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups did not respond to requests for interviews. But they have long promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40%-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong – and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement to Floodlight that US farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial”, using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint. “Biofuel producers are making investments today that will make their products net-zero or even net negative in the next two decades,” the statement said.

Some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the midwest – with the same fields planted in corn year after year – carries a heavy climate cost.

And research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to worsening water pollution and increased emissions, concluding the climate impact is “no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher”.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling – a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Nitrogen polluting rural drinking water

The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution, experts say.

According to a new report by Clean Wisconsin and the Alliance for the Great Lakes, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources – mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

In 2022, Tyler Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles (32km) east of Green Bay. Testing found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” Frye said.

He installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible – but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

Recent moves by the Trump administration have stripped out Biden-era incentives for climate-friendly farming practices, which the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, dismissed as part of the “green new scam”.

Research, however, shows that proven conservation practices – including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields – could make a measurable difference.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson is planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer on 130 of the 1,200 acres (485 hectares) of corn and soybeans she farms with her father. Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They have also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” – bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

They were counting on $20,000 a year from the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, but it never came.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps.”

In south-east Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres. He uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller crimping: flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” Lyle said.

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based aviation fuel could prompt another 114m acres to be converted to corn, or 20% more corn acres than the US plants for all purposes.

“The result,” said University of Iowa professor and natural resources economist Silvia Secchi, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ef13a588f12fdc935bbdd49c83b1a71dc0926d/349_0_3331_2666/master/3331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3f5041c33fd6866d30d9a350ba545f6",N,,2025-12-03 11:08:18.811490

,Congress,2025-12-03 14:28:18+00:00,Whistleblower Network News,The Stage is Set for International Community to Prioritize Environmental Whistleblowers,Greta Leeb,,,,,https://whistleblowersblog.org/environmental-whistleblowers/the-stage-is-set-for-international-community-to-prioritize-environmental-whistleblowers/,"2025 has proven to be a turning point in the establishment of strong oversight for environmental whistleblowers.

Scott Hajost, Senior Environmental Policy Advisor to the National Whistleblower Center (NWC), worked tirelessly to embed whistleblowers into international accords.
Together these resolutions and the IUCN program ensure that CAE and environmental whistleblowers are a high priority for IUCN.
Upcoming conventions and congresses, including the UN Convention Against Corruption, will continue to address environmental whistleblower protections and work towards strengthening enforcement of CAE.","2025 has proven to be a turning point in the establishment of strong oversight for environmental whistleblowers. After the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress (WCC) in Emirati capital Abu Dhabi—and thanks in large part to the ongoing efforts of the National Whistleblower Center’s Scott Hajost—whistleblower protections have been incorporated into five WCC resolutions, the IUCN 20 year vision, the IUCN four year program, and in the mandates of the World Commission on Environmental Law and Commission on Education and Communication (CEC). The Abu Dhabi Call to Action also addresses the urgent need for protection of environmental defenders—a category in which whistleblowers decisively fall. Combating crimes that affect the environment (CAE) is now firmly anchored in the IUCN mission after this year’s WCC. The stage is well set for environmental governance to play a role in the upcoming Doha UN Convention Against Corruption Conference of State Parties in early December and the Abu Dhabi UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in April 2026.

Scott Hajost, Senior Environmental Policy Advisor to the National Whistleblower Center (NWC), worked tirelessly to embed whistleblowers into international accords. Hajost (who is also IUCN US National Committee Vice-Chair) representing the NWC, collaborated with the Nature Crime Alliance World Resources (Alliance) based secretariat and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). The NWC and WCS are members of the Alliance.

Hajost worked closely with Elodie Parrat (senior government Engagement Manager at the Nature Crime Alliance secretariat), Charles “Chip” Barber (Director of the Alliance), and Susan Lieberman (Vice President of International Policy at the WCS), to draft a motion on CAE, and offer input on the 20 and four year programs.

As the group drafted a motion on CAE, the French government and the International Council of Environmental Law (ICEL) were drafting a similar proposal. These two motions were merged and, after a near-unanimous vote by the IUCN Members’ Assembly, became resolution 48/52 on Crimes that Affect the Environment.

In a statement on the resolution, Dr. Lieberman said, “Governments and civil society must recognize that nature crime is not a peripheral issue. It strikes at the heart of conservation, governance, and human rights. This motion is an essential step toward building a global response equal to the scale of the threat.”

Hajost views the collaboration between the Alliance, WCS, and NWC as vital to the promotion of environmental whistleblower protections. Fighting environmental crime requires multi-sectoral participation. Everyone, from governments to civil society to whistleblowers, are key to detecting, deterring, and prosecuting CAE. Hajost emphasized that the Alliance was the “glue” that held together such a large variety of actors. It was these partnerships, he continued, that “allowed the NWC to operate and really expand its reach.”

To continue working towards strong environmental whistleblower protections, Hajost said, “We started reaching out to a larger membership, including partners in the Nature Crime Alliance, members of the IUCN, to provide a larger critical mass to promote and support this motion.”

Whistleblowers, as discussed in past WNN reporting, are recognized in two other NWC supported resolutions. These include #49 on Strengthening Civic Spaces to Fulfill the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and #126 on Advancing Citizen Science to Support and Democratize Conservation. Two other resolutions, not NWC affiliated, included support for whistleblowers, demonstrating the increasing global awareness of their status as crucial to conservation. One of them, #104 on Safeguarding Biodiversity and Human Rights in Energy Transition Mineral Governance demands that state governments not tolerate attacks on human rights defenders and whistleblowers. The other resolution, #33 on Port State Measures Regarding Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, recognizes the role of whistleblowers in protecting global fisheries.

The resolutions are not yet published on the IUCN Congress resolutions platform, but all have been adopted and are in effect. Once officially published, the enumerations will change.

Together these resolutions and the IUCN program ensure that CAE and environmental whistleblowers are a high priority for IUCN. Reports from insiders allow authorities to crack down on the crimes that have the greatest impact on the ecosystem, including illegal logging, illegal fishing, wildlife trafficking, illegal mining, and even illegal dumping and polluting.

A particularly important aim of the three NWC resolutions has been to reiterate and emphasize Resolution 115 on Protecting Human and Peoples’ Rights Defenders and Whistleblowers. This motion was passed during the 2021WCC that took place in Marseille, France.

To further this goal, Resolutions 49 on Civic Spaces included a specific request to the Director General that Resolution 115 be upheld. According to Hajost, this resolution was the result of collaboration among members of the IUCN Civic Spaces Task Force. This group, chaired by Ernesto Herrera, Executive Director of Reforestamos México, worked to ensure the resolution highlighted the role of whistleblowers and environmental defenders within civic spaces ecosystem. Herrera is also the newly elected Chair of the IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy, which plays an important role in protecting whistleblowers.

It is evident that the fight to embed whistleblower protections into international environmental governance has widespread support and hearty legal foundations. The future of environmental defense must rely on these resolutions as supports for future efforts.

The IUCN has a clear plan for what these future efforts will be. The 20 year vision, four year plan, and Call to Action all sketch a clear picture of continued conservation, human rights defense, and, most notably, whistleblower protections. Further still, the new mandates of the WCEL and CEC outline similar aims. As before, much of the language on environmental crime and whistleblowers is the result of tireless effort by Hajost, the Alliance, and the WCS.

The 20 year vision, entitled Unite for Nature on the path to 2045, lays out the IUCN’s plan to align short term goals with sustainable, long term ambitions. It highlights a “rights- and equity-based approach to conservation action,” meaning whistleblowers and environmental defenders—the people most at risk of losing their right to speak and protest—must be uplifted. Unite for Nature clearly recognizes this: “Environmental justice mandates the right to ethical and responsible access to and use of land, territories, species and renewable resources, and embeds the right to life, the right to speak, and to be heard by environmental defenders and whistleblowers.”

Nature 2030: One nature, one future, the blueprint for the next four years, is even more insistent on safeguarding whistleblowers. Measures “to ensure the full protection of environmental human rights defenders and whistleblowers must be taken. There needs to be a response to the long-standing call for effective human rights due diligence, associated grievance mechanisms and for dealing with illegal and criminal activities through enhanced regulation and enhancement in criminal justice and application of the rule of law.” It is evident that CAE is well-recognized as an urgent problem for conservationists and nature defenders.

Crucially, Nature 2030 calls for the incentivization for informants: states must work “to strengthen legal and policy frameworks, including whistleblowers protection and reward laws, to more effectively prevent and combat crimes that affect the environment at national and international levels.” Reward laws are highly effective in encouraging potential informants to report on illicit activities, especially in states where whistleblowers face social, financial, and physical retaliation for their bravery.

All these documents—the resolutions, program, and vision—further anchor whistleblowers into the work of the IUCN and will help in promoting the role of whistleblower s in other international organizations and agreements. There is hope for the future.

The results of the IUCN offer concrete steps towards a brighter, healthier world. Upcoming conventions and congresses, including the UN Convention Against Corruption, will continue to address environmental whistleblower protections and work towards strengthening enforcement of CAE.

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Related: As Minnesota curbs climate emissions, what’s the future of natural gas?

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a new rule that aligns the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act with the U.S. Supreme Court’s unanimous 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision. Simultaneously, the Department of the Interior announced common-sense updates to Endangered Species Act (ESA) regulations that focus on species recovery rather than divisive litigation and illegal federal land management.

Tom Pyle, President of the American Energy Alliance, issued the following statement:

“The Trump administration’s WOTUS reform finally reins in decades of federal overreach and respects the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision. At the same time, the proposed Endangered Species Act updates will end the abuse of a 50-year-old law that has been wielded as a sledgehammer against landowners and has not provided sufficient incentives to recover endangered species. These are pro-environment, pro-economy, pro-America reforms that prove we can conserve our natural heritage and unleash American innovation at the same time. This is exactly the balanced, reasonable regulation the American people voted for.”

Waters of the United States

The WOTUS rule will focus federal regulation within the bounds set by the Constitution, empower states and local communities, and ensure that federal resources are focused on protecting America’s navigable waters.

The proposed rule, announced by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, will end the regulatory ping-pong between administrations and instead establish a rule that builds lasting credibility. Over the years, federal regulators have used the Clean Water Act to regulate wetlands, regardless of the restrictions the Constitution places on the federal government’s power. By focusing on the proper limits of the federal government, this new rule protects landowners from overzealous federal regulators and allows the state to exercise its regulatory prerogatives under the Constitution.

Endangered Species

The Endangered Species Act, like the Clean Water Act, has been improperly used as a tool of federal land use management for too long. Instead of properly focusing on protecting species, federal regulators have frequently wielded the ESA to punish landowners. This suite of regulatory changes focuses the listing process on the best scientific and commercial data, improves the consultation between federal agencies, requires species-specific rules for threatened (as opposed to endangered species), and clarifies how economic and national security impacts are taken into consideration in the designation of critical habitat.

Overall, these rules will create better incentives for federal regulators to partner with landowners to recover endangered and threatened species.

Environmental Advocacy Groups Some environmental groups have argued that narrowing federal jurisdiction exposes wetlands and headwater features to significant risk.
The proposed WOTUS definition introduces a wet-season standard that has potential to conflict with the decision.","On November 20, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a long-anticipated proposal to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). The proposed rule seeks to align federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (CWA) with the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Sackett v. EPA (2023), while addressing years of regulatory uncertainty following Rapanos, the 2015 Clean Water Rule, the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule, and the 2023 amendments.

For regulated industries and public agencies, the proposal is significant for two reasons:

It reflects the clearest effort in a decade to adopt a durable, administrable definition of WOTUS; and

It introduces multiple alternative regulatory approaches within the proposal itself, signaling the agencies’ desire for robust public input before finalizing any new rule.

Public comments are due January 5, 2026, under Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

I. The Supreme Court’s Direction in Sackett: Clarity, Predictability, and the Limits of Federal Power

Any serious discussion of WOTUS must begin with Sackett. The Court’s 2023 decision clarified the test for federal jurisdiction over wetlands and emphasized that regulated parties must have reasonably clear notice of the law’s reach. The majority held that jurisdiction must be grounded in clear, administrable criteria consistent with Congress’s limitation to “navigable waters.”

The Court underscored this in unusually direct language. In criticizing the “significant nexus” test, Justice Alito, writing for the majority, stated that a regulatory scheme that leaves citizens dependent on “the discretion of government officials” or the judgment of experts who “cannot say whether or not the Act applies to a particular parcel” raises serious constitutional concerns. The majority held that jurisdiction must be grounded in clear, objective criteria – criteria consistent with Congress’s textual limitation to “navigable waters.”

In short: the Court demanded a simpler, more predictable line.

EPA and the Corps were therefore compelled to revisit their 2023 rule and bring it in line with the Court’s standard:

Wetlands must have a continuous surface connection making them “indistinguishable” from a jurisdictional water.

Tributaries must have relatively permanent flow.

Groundwater cannot be used as a jurisdictional connector.

The significant nexus test cannot be used to establish jurisdiction under Sackett.

This new proposal explicitly embraces those holdings.

II. Overview of the Proposed Rule

1. Wet-Season Framework for “Relatively Permanent Waters”

The agencies propose to identify “relatively permanent” tributaries using regionally defined wet-season flow, rather than year-round hydrology alone. This is apparently intended to give field staff and applicants clearer, more predictable standards for determining whether a tributary qualifies as a WOTUS. The proposal invites comment on how “wet-season” should be determined and applied in the field.

2. New Definition of “Tributary”

Under the proposal, a tributary must:

have relatively permanent flow, and

connect to a downstream traditional navigable water.

Tributaries may pass through natural or artificial (e.g., culverts, pipes, ditches) features – so long as they convey relatively permanent flow.

A break in relatively permanent surface flow would sever jurisdiction upstream under the proposal. Unlike prior WOTUS definitions, jurisdiction cannot “skip” or otherwise be extended over non-jurisdictional segments.

3. Updated “Continuous Surface Connection” for Wetlands

EPA and the Corps propose clarifications consistent with Sackett:

Wetlands must abut a navigable water or a relatively permanent tributary.

Seasonal wet-season surface water may satisfy the test if the wetland remains physically connected.

Discrete artificial features (culverts, pipes, swales) cannot extend jurisdiction unless there is continuous flow.

This approach aligns with Sackett’s requirement that wetlands have a continuous surface connection making them ‘indistinguishable’ from jurisdictional waters. This is a departure from the 2023 rule, which treated artificial connections as sufficient. The agencies rescinded that interpretation earlier this year.

4. Lakes and Ponds

The proposed rule removes “intrastate” as a jurisdictional qualifier for lakes and ponds and revises how adjacency and surface connection are evaluated. The agencies expressly seek comment on multiple alternative models for assessing these waterbodies.

5. Exclusions – Including Several Alternatives

The agencies revise and request comment on:

Waste treatment system exclusion (including multiple definitional alternatives)

Prior converted cropland (one option would vest determination authority solely in USDA)

Ditches (alternative definitions distinguishing upland-excavated features from potentially jurisdictional ones)

The presence of these alternatives indicates the agencies’ apparent willingness to reshape portions of the rule based on stakeholder input.

III. Why the Agencies Included Multiple Alternative Approaches

This proposal contains more built-in alternatives than any prior WOTUS proposal. EPA and the Corps explicitly acknowledge the difficult balance they must strike:

Sackett constrains federal authority more sharply than any prior case.

States vary widely in their wetland protection frameworks.

Regulated parties need clarity, but hydrological systems are inherently variable and can be complex.

Courts have repeatedly rejected prior rules as either overbroad or insufficiently justified.

By embedding alternatives – such as differing definitions for tributaries, wetlands, lakes, and exclusions – the agencies are effectively asking:

“Tell us what works. Show us what is implementable. Show us what is legally durable.”

This means the comment period is unusually important. The agencies are signaling they intend to consider revisions.

IV. Reactions from Stakeholders – and Additional Context

Stakeholder reactions have been mixed, as reflected in national media coverage and industry commentary.

1. Environmental Advocacy Groups

Some environmental groups have argued that narrowing federal jurisdiction exposes wetlands and headwater features to significant risk. These concerns reflect genuine policy preferences but ignore the legal constraints imposed by the Constitution and the CWA as discussed by the Supreme Court.

Congress has never authorized EPA or the Corps to regulate all wetlands – nor could it under the limitations imposed on it by the U.S. Constitution. The CWA’s definition of “navigable waters” limits federal authority, and the Court has repeatedly emphasized that states – not the federal government – retain primary authority over intrastate waters and wetlands.

2. State Primacy in Wetland Regulation

Congressman Brian Mast (R-FL) praised the proposed rule as a step toward returning responsibility to the states, noting that communities with the most at stake are often the most attentive stewards of local waters. His position reflects a federalism-based view: that the appropriate forum for expanding wetland protection is within state legislatures, not Congress or EPA.

As federal jurisdiction narrows, state authority becomes more important. Many states already administer robust wetland programs that exceed federal requirements and protect isolated and intrastate wetlands regardless of WOTUS status.

These examples demonstrate that federal narrowing does not necessarily mean diminished protection – rather, it shifts decisions to the level of government best suited for local environmental management and can best address the hydrological variables that make it difficult to craft a one size fits all approach.

3. Potential Conflicts with Maui?

Since the Supreme Court’s County of Maui decision, concerns have emerged about confusion between sections 402 and 404 of the CWA. The proposed WOTUS definition introduces a wet-season standard that has potential to conflict with the decision. While some commentators perceive potential tension, the decisions address different and functional-equivalent discharges; Sackett addresses the geographic scope of WOTUS and rejects groundwater as a connector for jurisdiction.

V. Next Steps for Regulated Entities

Given the breadth of the proposed rule and the number of alternatives offered, we recommend the following:

1. Consider Filing Comments

Regulated industries, utilities, agriculture, developers, and local governments may benefit from providing input on:

the wet-season definition,

the tributary standard,

the treatment of lakes and ponds, and

exclusion alternatives.

The rule is open for public comment for 45 days, with a deadline of January 5, 2026. Written comments must reference Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322 and may be submitted through Regulations.gov or orally during one of two hybrid public meetings (dates to be announced).

2. Review Projects in the Pipeline

Projects with pending jurisdictional determinations or permit strategies should review whether the proposed rule could affect their jurisdictional status or timelines.

3. Monitor State-Level Activity

In states without robust wetland programs, legislators may take action. Clients with multi-state operations should track emerging state initiatives.

Conclusion

The November 2025 WOTUS proposal represents a meaningful attempt to produce a durable, judicially defensible definition of federal jurisdiction – one that meets the Supreme Court’s demands for clarity while acknowledging the hydrological complexity of the nation’s waters. EPA and the Corps have signaled openness to stakeholder input and have included significant alternative approaches for consideration.

For businesses, public agencies, and landowners, the proposal presents both challenges and opportunities. Clarity may finally be in sight, but the next two months will be critical in shaping what the final rule looks like.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15413_3100.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 11:08:23.229759

Saronic Technologies is a leader in maritime innovation, advancing autonomous vessel technology for defense and commercial markets.

The company recently acquired the former Gulf Craft shipyard in Franklin, establishing its Louisiana operations and workforce.

FRANKLIN, La. – Saronic Technologies, Inc. is expanding operations in St. Mary Parish to increase production capacity at its autonomous surface vessels shipyard. The $300 million investment will strengthen Louisiana’s advanced manufacturing base and create new opportunities for skilled workers in one of the state’s most historic maritime communities.

The company is expected to create 1,500 direct new jobs with an average annual salary of $87,936 at full employment, which is 46% above the average St. Mary Parish wage. When Saronic acquired the shipyard in April, it retained the existing workforce of 35 employees and has since grown to more than 100. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 1,770 indirect new jobs, for a total of 3,270 potential new job opportunities in the Bayou Region.

“Saronic Technologies’ decision to invest in Louisiana speaks to the strength of our workforce and the state’s leadership in defense manufacturing,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “Louisiana has long built the ships and technology that keep America strong. This project shows that our people, our ports and our pro-growth policies are creating jobs and securing our state’s place at the forefront of America’s defense economy.”

The expansion will add more than 300,000 square feet to the company’s shipyard in Franklin, including construction of three new slips, a larger warehouse and a new production line dedicated to large-vessel assembly. These additions will expand Saronic’s shipbuilding capabilities and help meet rising demand for autonomous vessels in the defense and commercial sectors.

“Saronic’s shipyard expansion in Franklin represents a major step forward for American shipbuilding, and we’re proud to deepen our roots here in Louisiana,” Co-Founder and CEO of Saronic Dino Mavrookas said. “The strong support we have received from our state and local partners has enabled us to move quickly and confidently as we scale production of our autonomous vessels. Together, we’re creating high-quality jobs, growing the Gulf Coast’s maritime economy, and building the advanced maritime capabilities our nation needs.”

Saronic established its Louisiana operations with the acquisition of the former Gulf Craft shipyard in Franklin and has since advanced production of its autonomous vessels at the site. In August 2025, the company marked a major milestone with the keel-laying of its first 150-foot vessel, the Marauder, further demonstrating Saronic’s commitment to growth in Louisiana.

“Saronic’s expansion draws on Louisiana’s historic strengths — a world-class maritime workforce, generations of shipbuilders and unmatched technical expertise,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “This project builds on that proud legacy by integrating new technology and innovation to ensure our state continues leading in the maritime and defense sectors for decades to come.”

Saronic broke ground on the expansion in November 2025 and expects construction to be completed by the end of 2026, with expanded operations beginning in 2027.

“As a life-long resident of St. Mary Parish with over 40 years of public service, this announcement sends a powerful message that we are a place of thriving opportunity and economic momentum,” St. Mary Parish President Sam Jones said. “St. Mary Parish’s best days are ahead of her, and this project is the beginning of a new era of economic leadership in South Louisiana. I am proud to welcome Saronic to St. Mary Parish, and I look forward to working with our state and regional partners in supporting this project as it becomes a cornerstone of our parish’s economic future.”

To secure the project in Franklin, the state of Louisiana offered Saronic Technologies a competitive incentives package that includes the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. It also included a $2 million performance-based grant and $3 million from the Economic Development Award Program (EDAP) to support facility and infrastructure improvements. The company is also expected to participate in Louisiana’s Quality Jobs Program.

“This project marks a significant step forward for St. Mary Parish and positions our community at the center of the Gulf Coast’s advanced manufacturing economy,” St. Mary Economic Development Director Evan Boudreaux said. “The scale of investment and the quality of jobs Saronic will create will have a generational impact: supporting our families, expanding career pathways for our residents, and reinforcing St. Mary’s position as a competitive destination for advanced industry. This opportunity is proof of Louisiana’s economic development comeback story, and I look forward to what’s next.”

“Saronic’s investment builds on the momentum we are seeing across St. Mary Parish and the wider Bayou Region,” COLAB President and CEO Christy Zeringue said. “This $300 million project brings together a skilled workforce and next-generation technology to support U.S. defense and drive meaningful economic growth. With 1,500 new jobs and hundreds more supported across the region, it reinforces our position as a place where innovative companies can succeed. We are proud to see continued growth that strengthens both our local economy and Louisiana’s role in the maritime and energy landscape.”

Entergy plans to build three new gas-fired power plants and new transmission infrastructure to provide the 2.3 GW of energy the center will need.

While there are measures in the agreement the PSC approved meant to mitigate the risks, some experts are concerned that the project could lead to higher bills for Entergy’s ratepayers.

Similar centers meant to support artificial intelligence applications are sprouting up across the country, and Entergy says more could be on the way to Louisiana.

If rates go up in Jefferson Parish, for example, constituents will call Henry’s office wanting to know why, and what the Legislature plans to do about it. If that call comes, he wants to have an intelligent answer.

And if there isn’t a good answer, that could threaten the economic development state officials are hoping to see over the next several years.

Henry stressed that he doesn’t have any preconceived notions about what the task force will come up with; maybe they’ll find out that Louisiana is doing everything right in this area.

“There’s no point in trying to hide the discussion or pretend like we don’t need to have it,” Henry said.

“It’s something that we need to do, and we’re going to push it through until we get some good, solid answers moving forward.”

Senate Natural Resources Chair Bob Hensgens, who is on the task force, said the fact that electricity rates in Louisiana remain low compared to the rest of the country, and that Meta chose Louisiana, could indicate that the state already has the right model.

But “our energy world is changing,” and it’s important to make sure the state is ready for what’s next, he said.

“Data centers are coming,” Hensgens said. “And we don’t reverse technology in this country. I use Grok [X’s AI tool] five times a day.”

The Public Service Commission also has a spot on the task force. PSC Chair Mike Francis tapped Executive Secretary Brandon Frey to fill that role.

Francis didn’t want to comment before today’s meeting. Commissioner Davante Lewis said the Louisiana PSC, in contrast to the approach in many other states, has independent constitutional authority to regulate power generation and infrastructure.

Lewis said he doesn’t think Senate President Henry is trying to encroach on that authority, though some legislators might not fully understand how the commission exercises its responsibilities.

But he does see room for collaboration.

For example, while most data center projects will be looking to use some renewable energy, Louisiana has trouble permitting and siting wind and solar, he said. Lawmakers could help to bridge that gap with the locals.

“If Meta says, ‘I want to build 2,000 megawatts worth of solar,’ and then we turn around and Richland Parish and Sabine Parish and Morehouse Parish all say ‘no solar here,’ that makes it hard to do,” Lewis said.

Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois was not available for comment, though LED provided the following statement: “This Task Force is an important initiative for Louisiana’s long-term economic competitiveness.

From LED’s perspective, it provides a coordinated forum for stakeholders to assess how Louisiana’s energy infrastructure can meet the needs of a rapidly growing and evolving economy.

A modern, reliable, and affordable electric grid is foundational not only for attracting new investment but also for supporting existing industries.”

Henry’s SR 195 created the Task Force on Energy Infrastructure and Modernization. The group’s report is due to the Senate by March 1.

GREENWOOD, S.C., Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- ES Foundry, an American company advancing U.S. solar by onshoring crystalline solar cell production, is closing 2025 with significant milestones that mark a turning point for domestic solar manufacturing.

The company's Greenwood, South Carolina, facility has reached full-scale PERC (Passivated Emitter Rear Contact) solar cell production, establishing a proven and Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)-compliant foundation for developers and asset owners seeking to meet the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) domestic-content requirements and reduce exposure to imported-supply-chain risk.

SEIA's most recent report underscores the strong national push to expand domestic solar manufacturing. ES Foundry reflects that ambition in action: we are one of the few manufacturers producing U.S. cells at commercial scale today, offering developers and asset owners a reliable, FEOC-compliant source as the broader domestic ecosystem builds out.

Built on field-proven PERC technology, ES Foundry's production enables developers and panel manufacturers to secure domestic-content and FEOC compliance today — while other next-generation cell technologies remain tied up in global intellectual property disputes.

""In 2025, ES Foundry demonstrated that American solar cell manufacturing is both achievable and essential,"" said Alex Zhu, CEO of ES Foundry. ""By focusing on proven, scalable PERC technology, we've given U.S. developers and asset owners the ability to build with confidence and certainty. Our next phase will take that momentum further — closing the import gap and strengthening America's energy independence.""

Throughout 2025, ES Foundry partnered directly with leading U.S. developers and asset owners to integrate its FEOC-free crystalline cells into commercial, community and utility-scale projects. By sourcing domestically produced cells, these companies strengthened their eligibility for the 10% IRA domestic-content bonus credit and reduced exposure to the supply-chain volatility and compliance risks associated with imported components.

Looking ahead, ES Foundry is advancing plans for a 2-GW Phase II expansion at its Greenwood facility in 2026. The next phase will further enhance efficiency, consistency and output. Once complete, ES Foundry will rank among the largest producers of crystalline solar cells in North America.

""Every new gigawatt of capacity we bring online reinforces America's clean-energy independence,"" Zhu added. ""ES Foundry's role is to manufacture, not wait. While others pause for patents and litigation, we're producing the cells and making the shipment.""

About ES Foundry

Dry Turkey: Another Precipitation Deviation

Rain didn’t have a regular place at the table again last month, which was drier than normal across North Carolina. Based on preliminary data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), the statewide average precipitation was 1.18 inches, which was our 16th-driest November since 1895.

Much of the Mountains, Piedmont, and Sandhills had less than an inch of total precipitation all month. That included Asheville with 0.66 inches and its 13th-driest November on record, 0.52 inches in Greensboro in its 9th-driest November, Fayetteville’s 0.55 inches for its 8th-driest November on record, Charlotte’s 0.49 inches and 8th-driest November.

Coastal areas fared a bit better, largely due to the impact of an offshore low pressure system on November 3. On that date, Hatteras had 5.21 inches of rain – its wettest single day since August 31, 2023, during Tropical Storm Idalia. With a final monthly total of 7.33 inches, it was the 14th-wettest November for Hatteras, while Elizabeth City had 3.79 inches and its 27th-wettest November on record.

For inland areas, though, there were very few notable rain events throughout the month. Before it emerged offshore, the low pressure system crossing the state on November 2 brought around half an inch across most of eastern North Carolina, and a warm front moving through on November 21 brought widespread but light rain generally totaling a half-inch or less.

Our dry November wrapped up an overall dry and drought-plagued fall for most of the state. Near the epicenter of the current spot of Severe Drought (D2) in the northern Coastal Plain, Greenville had 6.01 inches of rain – just 42% of its normal amount – all season for its 10th-driest fall on record.

In the Piedmont, where Moderate Drought (D1) expanded in November, Raleigh had its 13th-driest fall dating back to 1887, and Monroe tied for its 10th-driest fall on record out of the past 125 years.

Among our recent drought impacts, streamflow levels continued to decline in November, Falls and Jordan lakes fell more than two feet below their targets, and on a few dry and windy days, wildfire activity flared up, including a 160-acre fire burning near Banner Elk and a 500-acre fire on the Roanoke River National Wildlife Refuge.

Lukewarm Leftovers: Another Weakly Warm Month

Continuing another trend from this fall, November saw mostly near-normal to slightly above-normal temperatures statewide. NCEI reports a preliminary average temperature of 52.2°F and our 28th-warmest November out of the past 131 years.

Many eastern sites finished within a degree of their normal monthly temperature, including Wilmington tying for its 58th-warmest November in the past 150 years and Lumberton tied for its 39th-warmest November on record.

Central and western areas were 2 to 4 degrees above normal, on average, including the 16th-warmest November on record for Charlotte, the 25th-warmest for Greensboro, and tied for the 29th-warmest in Raleigh.

In contrast to recent years when we saw multiple 80-degree days in November 2023 and 2024, that sort of warmth had waned by last month. Instead, with weaker high pressure across the Southeast, our warmest days topped out in the mid-70s, and a series of cold frontal passages meant even that warm weather was short-lived.

Those fronts also ushered in some downright cold air, especially in an Arctic blast on November 11 that brought widespread below-freezing temperatures, officially ending the growing season across most of the state.

That morning’s low of 31°F in Wilmington was the earliest sub-freezing day there since 1998, and Laurinburg’s low of 26°F was its coldest night that early in the season since 1991.

Another chill arrived just in time for Thanksgiving, including widespread lows in the upper 10s and low 20s on Saturday, November 29. Our Goldsboro ECONet station bottomed out at 20°F – one of only six November nights that cold there in the past 24 years.

Icing on the Cake: A Snowy Surprise

Clearly there was no tryptophan slowing winter’s arrival last month, and it showed with more than just a few chilly nights. Along the cold front that ushered in that frigid air on November 11, precipitation fell as snow, with flakes observed from the Mountains all the way to the coastline.

The highest totals naturally fell on our highest elevation areas, including parts of the Great Smoky Mountains that had more than six inches, plus 3 inches in both Hot Springs and Grandfather Mountain.

Banner Elk had 2.5 inches, which was its earliest snow of that size since 2014. In recent years, it took until mid-January in both 2023 and 2024 to see that much snow in a single day.

While November snow in the Mountains isn’t too rare, it was unusual to see accumulations much farther east. Isolated areas south of the Albemarle Sound had up to 2 inches, with a widespread dusting to half an inch of snow.

Edenton reported 0.2 inches on the ground in its earliest measurable snow on record dating back to 1895. Williamston and Plymouth each measured 0.3 inches, which was also their earliest snowfall in a season – and in Williamston, it happened almost two full weeks earlier than the previous record, which was set in 1935.

While it’s tempting to hope that this November snow is a sign of things to come throughout the winter, it’s important to keep expectations in check. Another recent early-season snow in December 2018 turned out to be essentially the only snow most areas saw in that entire winter.

And as our winter outlook noted, the La Niña pattern in place this winter is often warmer and drier than normal in North Carolina, and we expect below-normal snowfall overall. Our best chances of snow will likely look like that November event: narrow windows of time when cold air is in place and any passing weather systems bring enough moisture to fuel some flakes.

With climatological winter officially underway, we now await whatever the weather serves up next, whether it’s more dry dishes, something fire-roasted amid an extended drought, or perhaps a trip to the freezer for another cold and frozen surprise.",https://climate.ncsu.edu/wp-content/themes/hillsborough/assets/img/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-03 11:09:18.450359

“Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.” ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate reporter.","The authors of a study that examined climate change’s potential effect on the global economy said Wednesday that data errors led them to slightly overstate an expected drop in income over the next 25 years.

The researchers at Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, writing in the journal Nature in 2024, had forecast a 19% drop in global income by 2050. Their revised analysis puts the figure at 17%.

The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.

The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.

The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.

Max Kotz, one of the study’s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet’s warming.

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School who wasn’t involved with the research, said the thrust of the Potsdam Institute’s work remains the same “no matter which part of the range the true figure will be.”

“Climate change already hits home, quite literally. Home insurance premiums across the U.S. have already seen, in part, a doubling over the past decade alone,” Wagner said. “Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.”

Renewables account for 55.78% of energy on the South West Interconnected System in November

First time that renewable energy has provided a majority of energy used by households and industry

The Cook Government's drive to make Western Australia a renewable energy powerhouse is setting records, with more than half the power used in November coming from renewable energy.

The South West Interconnected System (SWIS) reached a record 55.78 per cent renewable energy contribution in November, eclipsing the previous record of 49 per cent, set in November 2024.

Energy prices in November fell significantly due to increased use of renewables, with average prices for major customers down by almost 30 per cent on the previous month.

The Cook Government's plan to exit State-owned coal by 2030 and deliver large-scale renewables will continue to increase renewable energy output and keep downward pressure on energy prices.

The Clean Energy Link program to expand and upgrade the SWIS transmission grid will unlock more renewable energy resources.

The Government's Residential Battery Scheme is enabling households to benefit further from the State's clean energy transition, through rebates and no-interest loans to install solar panels and batteries.

The scheme delivers important cost of living relief by enabling households to store and use more of their solar energy, driving down power bills.

The scheme will enable 100,000 households to gain the benefits of solar energy.

Comments attributed to Premier Roger Cook:

""Becoming a renewable energy powerhouse underpins our plans to diversify our economy, ensuring it continues to be the strongest in the nation.

""My government is delivering record investment in our transmission infrastructure to connect households and businesses to cheaper renewable energy.""

Comments attributed to Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:

""Renewable energy is the cheapest form of generation, and renewables and storage firmed by gas when needed is the least cost energy mix for households and businesses.

The Department of Energy has canceled or restructured billions in clean energy commitments, and federal priorities have clearly shifted. For companies that built their growth strategies around policy incentives, this may feel like a door is closing.

But it isn’t closing — it’s just opening somewhere new.

The Trump administration’s recent moves, including the “One Big Beautiful Bill” , signal a broader focus on strengthening the country’s industrial base and securing energy reliability. For climate tech firms, this creates a different kind of opportunity, one rooted in supporting the energy demands of artificial intelligence infrastructure and domestic supply chains, rather than in traditional subsidies.

A new kind of challenge

Artificial intelligence has become the economic centerpiece of 2025. As data centers multiply, so do their energy demands. Gartner projects that 40% of AI data centers will face power constraints by 2027, and the International Energy Agency expects U.S. data center electricity use to double by 2030.

That’s not an engineering footnote; it’s a national constraint, an infrastructure and competitiveness issue. The White House knows it and DOE knows it, which is why the latter is repositioning its mission around powering the digital economy; just two weeks ago, DOE reorganized under new priorities including fossil fuels, geothermal, and nuclear, formalizing its ongoing policy realignment. This consolidation aligns with early Trump administration interest in expanding domestic uranium production, critical minerals processing and geologic hydrogen exploration — areas now receiving elevated attention inside DOE.

This is where climate tech comes back into focus, not as a subsidy recipient, but as a strategic enabler.

In July, DOE designated four federal sites — Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and Savannah River Site — for co-located AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Two months later, it issued a request for applications from projects that combine clean energy, storage, and advanced materials development for those sites.

Meanwhile, OBBB has opened $7.5 billion for domestic critical minerals extraction and processing. The DOE followed that up with $1 billion in additional targeted funding for lithium, nickel, rare earths, gallium, and graphite. The intent is unmistakable: rebuild the industrial base that supports U.S. electrification and AI-scale energy demand.

Put simply, DOE funding has moved upstream, toward the technologies that make energy abundance and grid reliability possible; it’s these companies that deliver grid capacity and supply chain strength that are expected to lead the next chapter. The recent cancellations make that shift unmistakable —many of the programs cut or restructured were the kinds of deployment and grant-driven initiatives that defined federal clean energy support over the past two years.

Where climate tech fits in

This moment calls for climate tech companies to think about that strategic alignment. The technologies that stand to gain are those that enhance reliability, flexibility, and integration across the grid. The companies most likely to succeed will:

Solve for capacity as well as carbon: The winning pitch today is scale and reliability, not ideology. If your tech can enable 24/7 power for AI operations, industrial processing, or critical refining, that’s your ticket back onto DOE’s radar.

Focus on the middle of the value chain: America’s bottleneck in critical minerals isn’t only the mineral resources themselves, but rather refinement and processing. That’s also true for power. Between generation and delivery lie storage, transmission, and grid efficiency — the “refining” layer of energy. That’s where climate tech can deliver the most impact.

Link your innovation to national competitiveness: Framing matters. In our current political reality, a clean energy company that powers AI data centers or reduces the energy intensity of critical refining isn’t a climate company; it’s an infrastructure company. Speak that language and you’ll be heard.

Don’t wait for subsidies: DOE’s AI energy hubs will rely on direct public-private partnerships, not tax credits. Position your technology as shovel-ready for site deployment, not dependent on long-term grant cycles.

This approach demands agility. Climate tech firms that can frame their solutions as infrastructure enablers, supporting AI growth, manufacturing, and domestic energy resilience, will remain well-positioned for funding and partnerships, no matter the administration. And we’re already seeing examples across the market — from advanced materials companies aligning with data center procurement needs to storage developers repositioning projects around reliability services for high-capacity computing loads.

The opportunity to be seized

Even as federal programs consolidate, private capital is accelerating. U.S. climate tech investment reached $15.3 billion in the first half of 2025, up 35% year over year. The difference lies in focus: investors are prioritizing mature, infrastructure-ready technologies that can scale to meet industrial and digital energy needs.

The policy environment may look different, but the underlying goal — building a resilient, low-carbon energy system — hasn’t changed. It has simply broadened. Climate tech companies that can strengthen supply chains, stabilize the grid, or power the digital economy are still central to that mission. And those prepared to adapt will define the next chapter of the country’s energy story.

,American Energy,2025-12-03 12:52:49+00:00,Utility Dive,Solving PJM's data center problem | Utility Dive,"Robert Walton, Tom Rutigliano, Ethan Howland, Claire Lang-Ree",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solving-pjms-data-center-problem/805600/,"NRDC estimates that the public will pay over 80% of increased capacity costs caused by data center demand forecasts.
A modest investment on the scale of data center development can build enough storage to cover the demands of data centers and provide a clear path to zero-carbon operations.
Similarly, a little data center flexibility can make a big difference in grid reliability and costs for other consumers.
Our proposal embraces that, allowing any data center willing to be flexible in its operations to pull its own weight through PJM’s demand response programs.
States that wish to incentivize responsible data centers can continue to do so — all this approach adds is an insurance policy.","Tom Rutigliano is senior advocate and Claire Lang-Ree is advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

This summer, the 67 million people served by the PJM Interconnection were hit with an extra $9.4 billion in electricity bills as proposed data centers drove up prices. Another $1.4 billion increase is already locked in for next summer, and there’s no end in sight.

Unless something changes, PJM consumers will pay an extra $100 billion through 2033 as new data centers continue to exceed available power supply. By 2028, families in the region will be paying around $70 a month extra on their electricity bills.

Future reliability is also at risk. The power grid in the region is full: Starting in summer 2026, PJM will have just enough power to keep the grid reliable.

Data centers are connecting to the grid faster than we can build new power supply. Right now, PJM has no authority to stop those connections, and data centers are allowed to connect even if there isn’t enough electricity to go around. If nothing changes, by June 2027, the region may fall below reliability standards. That means a greater risk of rolling blackouts, especially during winter storms and summer heat waves. PJM appears to agree: It recently published scenarios that show deep shortages in 2030.

The consequences of overestimating data center demand fall on the public. There are currently no guardrails to ensure that developers and utilities don’t speculate wildly about the demand that will exist in the future.

This overestimation directly impacts prices — it’s how PJM determines how much capacity to buy, three years in advance. NRDC estimates that the public will pay over 80% of increased capacity costs caused by data center demand forecasts. If these data centers don’t show up, the public is still left footing the bill. To add to the problem, most of the money goes to existing power plants, not new supply that we desperately need.

That is why, in collaboration with a bipartisan coalition of over 50 state legislators, led by Maryland Sen. Katie Fry Hester, we’ve proposed a simple solution. PJM must stop buying capacity for new data centers and instead only provide them with interruptible service until they bring their own capacity.

Data centers can still connect to the grid and get power 99.97% of the time. Not providing a guarantee of service for that remaining 0.03% of hours will save the public tens of billions of dollars.

Bring-your-own-capacity puts responsibility for new supply where it belongs: on the data centers that need the power. It’s only common sense. The biggest companies in the world can make their own capital investments. They certainly shouldn’t be allowed to force the public to make investments on their behalf or risk blackouts so that electricity can go to data centers instead.

This doesn’t mean developers need to rush to build traditional power plants. Given reports of multiyear delays in obtaining critical parts and completing necessary transmission upgrades, that might not even be possible. The electric industry just moves slower than Silicon Valley is used to.

Instead, data centers should be looking to rapidly obtain firm service by investing in energy storage and being as flexible as possible. Right now, in PJM, a 6-hour battery contributes more to reliability than a gas-fired combustion turbine, thanks to the battery’s better reliability in the winter. This storage also provides a crucial missing link PJM needs to become a low-carbon grid. A modest investment on the scale of data center development can build enough storage to cover the demands of data centers and provide a clear path to zero-carbon operations. Any tech company that’s serious about its climate commitments and speed to market should be looking very seriously at large-scale, grid-connected energy storage.

Similarly, a little data center flexibility can make a big difference in grid reliability and costs for other consumers. Our proposal embraces that, allowing any data center willing to be flexible in its operations to pull its own weight through PJM’s demand response programs. Similarly, our proposal lets power generation developers willing to connect to the grid quickly — without waiting years for transmission upgrades — to dedicate every watt of their output to support data center operations.

Many proposals include incentives for data centers to bring their own generation or capacity, but they don’t say what happens if they don’t. Without a solid backup plan, these proposals are not guaranteed to protect residents from higher electricity bills and risk of blackouts. States that wish to incentivize responsible data centers can continue to do so — all this approach adds is an insurance policy.

If nothing changes, people served by PJM will spend billions to prop up data centers, all while still risking blackouts on the hottest and coldest days of the year. This is unacceptable.

On Nov. 19, PJM members voted no-confidence on 12 different proposals for how to solve the issue of large loads, including on PJM’s own proposal. Now the board of directors must choose: Will it fully protect the general public from the risks of blackouts and soaring electricity bills, or will it fall short on providing reliable electricity?",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/bCSVJLnilGtnliy42Drlx0ROwC-rUTDnCmO_RJb78ho/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9WaXJnaW5pYV9kYXRhX2NlbnRlci5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-03 09:59:02.398946

The vast majority of new cars in the U.S. are sold through dealerships.

And in many states, laws to protect dealerships prohibit car companies from selling their vehicles without that middleman.

Budds: “Some of them outright ban or prohibit direct sales of vehicles to consumers. Others offer limited access.”

Hannah Budds is with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, a group that’s advocating for more electric vehicles in the state.

In North Carolina, direct-to-consumer sales – for example, at a retail showroom or online – are mostly prohibited. Only Tesla has qualified for an exception.

Budds says these restrictions limit the growth of EVs in the state because they reduce consumer choice. In fact, some EV brands are simply unavailable in North Carolina.

Budds: “So in order to kind of enable access to EVs for all consumers, they really do need more options and price points to choose from.”

So her group is pushing for policies that allow more direct-to-consumer EV sales.

Budds says it’s a common-sense solution that will benefit consumers and accelerate the transition to a clean energy future.

The state signed off on the developers’ plan for the overall project, known as Quantum Shores, with a few conditions:

• Out of caution regarding potential vapor intrusion into buildings, the IEPA is requiring either the construction of venting systems under future building floor slabs or additional evaluation to verify venting is not needed, once planned building locations are finalized

The question now is whether the region’s green dreams can endure a pivot to natural gas by its political leaders.

Three of the largest clean energy projects in New England’s history are nearing completion after a decadelong push to curb its reliance on gas, bolster its electric grid and slash planet-warming pollution.

But even as the finish line comes into sight, some of the region’s leaders are considering plans that are antithetical to the climate goals that sprung those projects to life. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, has openly embraced the idea of building gas pipelines. Massachusetts lawmakers briefly considered, then rejected, a plan to water down the state’s climate targets. And the whole region has effectively pressed pause on offshore wind development.

New England leaders say they are as committed to clean energy as ever. But the political shift highlights how a region that spent almost 10 years building two massive offshore wind projects and a transmission line carrying hydropower from Canada is increasingly focused on cutting electricity prices — not carbon.

“Time is already a non-renewable resource, but then you recognize that the more time it takes to build any of this stuff, the more uncertainty you’re exposed to,” said Ben Downing, a former Democratic Massachusetts state senator who authored a landmark clean energy bill in 2016. “I think that if there’s one consistent theme throughout the last decade, it’s that.”

New England is a bellwether for national climate policy. Five of its six states have committed to achieving deep carbon reductions by midcentury. (New Hampshire, where Republicans have had a trifecta in state government for seven of the last 10 years, is the exception.)

Its efforts to remake its energy system began in earnest in 2016, with passage of a Massachusetts law that directed utilities to buy large amounts of Canadian hydropower and offshore wind. The law paved the way for what would become Vineyard Wind 1, an 800-megawatt offshore wind farm 15 miles from Martha’s Vineyard, and New England Clean Energy Connect, a 146-mile transmission line that will carry Canadian hydropower into the U.S. through Maine. Connecticut and Rhode Island followed with plans to buy power from Revolution Wind, a 715-MW wind project about 12 miles off the coast of Rhode Island.

All three projects are nearing completion, having navigated a series of major setbacks. Vineyard Wind’s permit was delayed during the first Trump administration. It was later approved by the Biden administration, but construction was slowed first by a dockworkers strike and then by an accident that saw a turbine blade detach and crash into the ocean. Half of the project’s 62 turbines were generating power at the end of September.

The hydropower line, known as NECEC, faced a series of lawsuits and a ballot referendum in which Maine residents voted to revoke a permit for the project. The state’s highest court later struck down the vote, ruling that it was unconstitutional for voters to retroactively cancel a project that had received a permit and started construction. NECEC, which is capable of serving 8 percent of New England’s electric load, is set to be energized by the end of the year.

Construction of Revolution Wind was first delayed when contamination was discovered at the project’s onshore substation, which is being built at the site of a former military dump. Then in August, it was dealt a near fatal blow when the Trump administration ordered construction to stop. That decision was reversed in court, and the administration has not appealed. Ørsted, one of two companies building the project, said in a recent earnings call that the project was 85 percent complete and is scheduled to come online during the second half of 2026.

“I think all three projects are coming none too soon in providing real benefits,” said Philip Bartlett, who chairs the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

The projects are expected to help alleviate the region’s reliance on gas, which accounts for roughly half of New England’s power generation and is the leading source of home heating. Yet the region has limited pipeline capacity to serve that demand, leaving the region exposed to spikes in gas prices and leading to fears that its pipelines could become overburdened in a cold snap.

The completion of NECEC, Vineyard Wind and Revolution Wind could ease those concerns, said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She estimated that the three projects would increase New England’s electricity supply by 10-13 percent, depending on how much hydropower is delivered in a given year.

The results are becoming evident. Even at half capacity, Vineyard Wind is more than twice as big as the region’s largest onshore wind project. (Maine’s Bingham Wind development is 184 MW.) New England’stop 10 days for wind generation have all come since the beginning of October. ISO New England, the regional grid operator, said completing the power line and the wind project would make the region’s electric system well-prepared for winter.

“This is really, really good news for ratepayers in New England and for the reliability of our grid to have so much capacity being added in the near term,” Dykes said.

Yet she acknowledged that the world is different today than it was a decade ago. Lamont has signaled his openness to new pipelines as part of a push to address Connecticut’s sky-high energy costs. The state has also launched a program to assess potential sites for a new nuclear plant, Dykes said.

“If there’s a solution that can help bring costs down for ratepayers and improve affordability that can get developed, there’s nothing that’s off the table,” she said.

Whether other states follow suit remains to be seen. When the Trump administration halted Revolution Wind, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee (D) indicated that he was open to permitting gas pipelines in exchange for keeping the wind project moving.

“We don’t have a gas line. But I’m with Gov. Lamont. It’s like, we’ll open up those conversations to make that happen for an all-in strategy,” McKee said at a September press conference. A spokesperson for McKee did not respond to a request for comment.

One of the biggest questions relates to Massachusetts. State lawmakers floated a plan to make the Massachusetts 2030 climate target an aspirational goal. Current law calls for halving emissions from 1990 levels. Lawmakers later walked back the proposal to water down that target, but it’s unclear how the state will meet its goals. Massachusetts officials have talked up plans for tapping into onshore wind in Maine and importing offshore wind from Canada.

At the same time, Gov. Maura Healey (D) has opened the door to new gas infrastructure. In September, she said she supported a plan to increase the capacity of an existing pipeline into the region.

“I’ve said we need energy from all sources. You know, wind, solar, gas,” Healey said at a press conference last month. She pledged to work with lawmakers to lower energy costs, saying “we know it’s a struggle for residents and our businesses, and that’s why I’ve continued to make energy affordability, lowering your bills, a priority.”

It’s unclear what that means for the state’s climate goals. Massachusetts already faced a steep climb toward meeting its targets. Its emissions were 28 percent below 1990 levels in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. That means it would have to cut its emissions an additional 22 percent this decade to meet the goal.

New England overall has hit a carbon wall in recent years. Climate pollution from the region’s power plants fell 57 percent between 2005 and 2019, according to EPA data. The decline was driven by the closure of aging coal- and oil-fired plants in favor of cleaner burning gas units.

But power sector emissions have climbed steadily in the years since, reaching 27 million tons last year — an increase of 5 million tons over 2019 levels. The region has struggled to replace the carbon-free generation that was lost with the retirement of Pilgrim Nuclear Station in 2019. There are also no more coal plants to close following the shutdown of Merrimack Station in New Hampshire earlier this year.

The road ahead is even more challenging, with electricity demand projected to rise 11 percent by 2035 due to electrification of heating and transportation. That marks a reversal for the region, where demand has declined since 2005, thanks to energy efficiency measures and rooftop solar installations.

New England leaders had traditionally looked to offshore wind and Canadian hydro for new infusions of power. But it’s not clear if those sources can offer future electrons.

Vineyard Wind and Revolution Wind were conceived as the first of many offshore wind projects in New England. They are now likely to be the only two that are built in the region this decade, and maybe the next. The Trump administration is seeking to revoke permits for two projects, New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind, which had received preliminary power contracts from Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Deadlines for finalizing those contracts have been repeatedly postponed.

Meanwhile, a historic drought in Quebec has stopped the flow of Canadian power into the U.S. — and even reversed it. In October, New England exported 30 gigawatt-hours of electricity to Quebec, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. That is the first time since at least 2019 that New England has been an exporter of electricity to Quebec on a monthly basis, according to a review of federal data by POLITICO’s E&E News.

“Hydro resources of Canada were considered inexhaustible in many state capitals in New England. And the reality is that for pretty much this entire fall, New England has been an electricity exporter to Canada for the first time I can ever remember,” said Dan Dolan, executive director of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group representing power plant owners in the region. “That is a fundamentally changed circumstance for resource additions and the overall energy mix in the region.”

Hydro-Québec, the provincial utility, said it has enough power to fulfill its contract obligations for NECEC. It is also building out the province’s onshore wind resources. The company hopes wind power can provide more domestic electricity, leaving hydropower available to be shipped south, said Serge Abergel, chief operating officer at Hydro-Québec Energy Services.

But he acknowledged that the drought has altered Hydro-Québec’s thinking. The utility has long sold large amounts of power in New England’s spot market, but going forward it could choose moments when New England power prices are high because of waning solar and wind generation. It may even import power from New England during periods with large amounts of wind and solar.

“I think that the future will be more dynamic as we see more price fluctuations because of the intermittency factor in the market,” Abergel said.

Much of the region’s hopes now rest on a plan to build new transmission lines into the rolling farm fields of northern Maine, which boasts New England’s best onshore wind and solar resources. ISO New England recently announced it had received six bids to build new transmission capacity linking Maine to the rest of the region.

The effort represents a significant shift in the region’s approach to clean energy. NECEC was a project spearheaded by Massachusetts and built in Maine. The opposition to that power line convinced the region’s leaders that more collaboration was needed to share the costs and benefits of major infrastructure projects, said Bartlett of Maine’s Public Utilities Commission.

“I think a big important lesson from that is if we’re going to build big energy infrastructure in the region, I think it’s important that all the states kind of be at the table,” he said.

The last decade showed that the greatest barriers to clean energy are bureaucratic and political, said Downing, the former Massachusetts senator who now works at the Engine, a nonprofit clean energy incubator supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Last summer, Downing went on a family vacation to Martha’s Vineyard. They drove out to the tip of the island, where they could see the towering turbines of Vineyard Wind on the horizon.

“It’s a beautiful thing, and that’s after everything that they’ve had to go through,” Downing said. “The fact that we’ve done it at all shows that we can do it. And, yeah, it’s nowhere near the straight line that we thought it was. Nowhere near that. But that isn’t a reason to say, ‘Well, take a right turn when we thought we were going straight. The thing’s over.’ No way, no way. We got to come up with a new plan to get back online.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d6/b0/fd195e494fcabeb4f221089a7ad9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/614802176,N,,2025-12-03 09:59:06.215523

A new report from the Climate Litigation Network explores how 10 years of court cases have helped establish ""binding legal duties” for leaders and big polluters to help protect citizens from climate harm.

Many of these legal battles were inspired by the groundbreaking Urgenda case, which marked the first time a court anywhere in the world ordered a government to take stronger climate action.

The ruling came after the non-profit Urgenda Foundation, along with almost 1,000 citizens, petitioned Dutch courts to hold the government to its own commitments to reduce emissions, protect the public and uphold human rights.

Climate cases are ‘restoring agency and trust’

The report, titled Laying the foundations for our shared future: how ten years of climate cases built a legal architecture for climate protection, argues that the rise of climate litigation is a direct response to governmental and corporate failure to address the “defining challenge of our time”.

Globally, almost nine in ten people (89 per cent) want their governments to do more to tackle climate change – yet only one in five people believe their government will keep its promises.

“In this context, climate litigation has become a means of restoring agency and trust,” the report reads.

“Litigation allows citizens to seek accountability through independent courts, which promise to assess their plight according to the law rather than short-term political pressures.”

Climate defences

Successfully suing a government or powerful company once seemed impossible, but long-standing defences are now being challenged. Since the 1990s, corporations have relied on a trio of key arguments to “resist accountability” in the courts.

These are the “leave it to politics defence” which argues that climate policy is too complex for the courts; the “drop in the ocean” defence, which claims that a single country or company is too globally insignificant to create enforceable legal duties; and the “choose any target” defence, which says that governments and companies are free to determine the level and timing of their emissions reductions.

Case by case, the power of these defences has dwindled, resulting in strengthened climate targets and amended laws in countries like Brazil, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Korea.

This has helped lay down legal foundations that also empower communities to challenge once untouchable fossil fuel giants like Shell and TotalEnergies.

Climate change in the courts

The report details a number of successful climate cases that have gone through the courts following the Urgenda case.

For example, in 2015, Asghar Leghair filed a case against the Pakistani Government demanding that it do more to protect the country from increasinglysevere climate impacts. The Lahore High Court ruled in favour of Leghair, ordering the establishment of a Climate Change Commission and tasked government agencies with implementing climate policies.

In Switzerland, members of KilmaSeniorinnen challenged the government’s climate inaction as a violation of their human rights.

The case led to a landmark decision of the European Court of Human Rights, which found that Switzerland was in fact breaking its human rights obligations by failing to adopt a sufficient reduction pathway for greenhouse gas emissions.

Even failed court cases, like Pabai v Commonwealth of Australia, have successfully drawn national attention to the existential threat climate change poses and underscored the need for stronger government action.

This case saw two elders from the Torres Strait Islands file a class action against the Australian Government in 2021 over rising sea levels that threatened their community.

In 2015, mountain guide and farmer Saúl Luciano Lliuya took RWE, Germany’s largest electricity producer, to court.

Lliyua argued that the company’s emissions were contributing to the melting of glaciers in Peru, and that RWE should help pay for flood defences for the city of Huaraz.

Despite the case failing, the court’s ruling now means that if a major carbon emitter refuses to take “protective measures”, then it could be held responsible for costs proportional to its share of emissions, even before damages occur.

Overall, the report says these kinds of cases have created legal building blocks defining how governments must reduce emissions to prevent dangerous climate change. This includes limiting temperature increase to 1.5℃, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, and ensuring that big polluters can be held accountable for climate damages.

A ‘legal imperative’

“What was a moral imperative ten years ago has become a legal imperative,” says Sarah Mead, co-director of the Climate Litigation Network.

“Big polluters – the governments and companies most responsible for climate change – have a duty to pull their weight in the global effort to stop dangerous climate change.”

Mead adds that the world’s highest-emitting companies shouldn’t be able to ""pollute with impunity” and profit “on the back of our future”, arguing the courts are now catching up.

Dennis van Berkle, Legal Counsel at Urgenda, says that over the past decade, people have used the courts to build an accountability framework from the ground up.

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger made the cost of living the focus of her campaign, frequently mentioning high energy bills. House Democrats, whose majority has been boosted by the addition of 13 new members of their party, are also expected to focus on these bread-and-butter issues.

In Virginia, the cause of these high bills is not hard to identify: Data centers are driving up demand well beyond the available supply, and high fossil fuel prices are pinching a state that relies on natural gas for most of its electricity. Spanberger has committed to making data centers “pay their fair share,” and both she and legislators will be looking for other opportunities to lower costs.

With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

The bad news is that adding ever more data centers across Virginia means the upward pressure on electricity prices will continue. If the governor and legislators don’t want to kick tech companies to states with spare capacity, and if the administration of President Donald Trump continues to throttle the energy supply with its war on wind and solar, lowering energy costs in the near term likely isn’t possible.

Even so, there is a lot that Spanberger and the General Assembly can do to protect residential consumers from these higher prices.

Making data centers pay their fair share means more than tweaking rate structures. Several Virginia utilities have created special rate classes for large load users like data centers. The utilities will require data center operators to sign long-term contracts committing them to paying for a large percentage of the electricity and transmission they say they need, even if they don’t end up using that much or leave the Virginia market prematurely.

These new tariffs can help protect other customers from some – though not all – of the risk involved in serving data centers, but they don’t address the “fair share” issue. The current allocation of transmission costs, with residential ratepayers picking up most of the tab for new lines that don’t benefit them, needs to change. If the SCC determines it doesn’t have authority to do that on its own, the General Assembly and Spanberger should pass legislation to make it happen.

The harder problem is how to make residents whole for rate increases that result from data centers gobbling up all available power. The supply and demand problem has been compounded by a lot of bad decisions, with plenty of blame to go around. The federal government has driven up fossil fuel prices by allowing the export of increasing amounts of natural gas, while hindering and even blocking solar and offshore wind projects that could make up the deficit.

Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin is to blame for illegally pulling Virginia out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), removing the market incentive for Virginia utilities to increase investments in low-cost renewable energy instead of burning expensive fossil fuels. (His promotion of the false narrative that gas is “cheap” doesn’t help.)

Virginia utilities share the blame for relying too much on natural gas and high-priced electricity imported from other PJM states. And grid operator PJM is to blame for failing to approve enough new generation, including wind and solar facilities that make up the vast majority of projects waiting for approval to interconnect.

This history leaves Spanberger with a fine mess. Keeping prices in check now requires two things that can actually be accomplished during the next four years: a greater buildout of solar generation and energy storage to get more capacity on the grid; and investments in energy efficiency and rooftop solar to take pressure off the demand side.

Solve utility solar siting with agrivoltaics. Virginia needs more energy, and solar is the only source that can be built quickly. Yet one of the knottiest problems confronting the General Assembly in the past few years has been the rise of anti-solar sentiment in rural counties.

Landowners who want to lease their property for solar, or even to install arrays for their own use, find themselves stymied by opposition from neighbors who don’t like the look and are able to persuade county boards to deny permits. As we’ve seen, sometimes denial of a solar permit even follows approval of an energy-sucking data center.

Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

Last year the General Assembly came close to passing a bill that would require solar developers to implement industry best practices. Passing legislation like that this year will address the legitimate concerns of localities around controlling erosion and maintaining native plant buffers. But more can be done to make solar look and function like a normal part of Virginia’s agricultural economy.

Already, solar facilities have become integrated with agriculture, as sheep and sometimes cattle take over vegetation management and farmers learn which crops do well growing between rows of solar arrays. It’s a trend that offers benefits to the land and the community alike. Farmers are struggling; solar can provide a stable income while protecting land from permanent development and putting much-needed energy on the grid.

Businesses are ahead of public policy on this. Virginia-based Gray’s Lambscaping manages vegetation with over 800 sheep at solar farms across the state, and the company plans to grow to over 5,000 sheep by the end of this year. Meanwhile, solar panels have proven compatible with a wide range of food crops.

Virginia should take a leading role in expanding agrivoltaics. Virginia law already recognizes the right to farm as an exception to localities’ authority over land use decisions, and this should be extended to farmers who put solar on their land, as long as they are also using the same land for traditional agricultural practices like grazing and crops.

Install solar on new public buildings and schools. Heck, put it everywhere. In the past ten years or so, Virginia’s commercial solar sector has blossomed while saving taxpayers money. To date, an estimated 150 Virginia schools have installed solar panels, saving schools about 25% on their energy bills. Solar on every sunny school rooftop would add up to more than 1,000 MW of carbon-free generation. Extend the effort to the roofs of all suitable public buildings across the state, and that number can go much higher.

Dominion and APCo have long tried to squelch competition from rooftop solar, a war that looks increasingly foolish as Virginia finds itself short on energy for all customers. Earlier this year Congress drastically accelerated the phase-out of solar tax incentives, but the savings remain available for commercial and utility-scale projects for the next two years. There is no shortage of good ideas out there to be acted upon. Spanberger and legislators should take full advantage of that opportunity to install as much solar as possible.

Battery storage at data centers does triple duty. While solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest way to generate power, it needs batteries or other forms of energy storage to make it into a 24/7 resource, and storage remains relatively expensive. For tech companies, however, the calculus makes more sense.

Data centers need backup power anyway; they typically have three layers of redundancy so that they never risk losing power when the grid goes down. Today the backup power is mostly provided by massive diesel generators, sometimes three times as many as they might actually need. Most of these have no pollution controls and are therefore not supposed to run except in emergencies and for testing and maintenance.

Some tech companies are now installing generators with selective catalytic converters that produce fewer emissions. The catch is that these can legally be used in non-emergency situations, raising the possibility that they might be used for demand-response or peak shaving. In effect, data centers would be solving the peak demand problem with one of the dirtiest forms of energy. The cumulative effect on air quality could be worrisome, and Virginia’s carbon footprint would grow at a time when the law says it should be shrinking.

What if, instead of diesel generators, data centers installed storage as their first line of defense against power outages, leaving diesel generators to be used only in the rare case of extended grid outages? Air quality would benefit, carbon emissions would decrease, and the data centers would have the backup power they need. The tech companies would pay more upfront but could be compensated by utilities for using their storage capability for grid services and demand response, lowering their draw from the grid at peak demand times.

All the data centers in Virginia today use 6 gigawatts of power. That much storage would exceed the targets set in the VCEA for Dominion and APCo combined. Even limiting the requirement to two hours of storage at new data centers would bring enough storage online quickly to eliminate the expensive demand peaks that drive the high price of energy.

Require data center operators to source their own zero-carbon electricity. Most of the tech companies have sustainability commitments that they aren’t meeting, so it isn’t asking too much of them to put them in charge of this effort. Legislation to require this as a condition of accepting Virginia’s generous tax subsidies has been defeated for the past two years. The difference this year is that rising energy prices are now affecting everyone.

Under this proposal, the zero-carbon electricity doesn’t have to come from Virginia, as long as it is available to customers here. Maybe the tech companies could even tap into their considerable influence with the Trump administration to make electricity more plentiful and affordable by reversing its war on solar and wind energy.

Why, after all, should Virginia residents sacrifice for the richest corporations in the world? If “paying their fair share” means anything, it should mean that data centers, not residents, bear the costs of making enough energy available to Virginia, and complying with our clean energy mandate.

Lower demand with energy efficiency and distributed solar. The gap between energy supply and demand does not have to be filled entirely through supply-side solutions. Lowering demand should also be part of the solution. Virginia utilities, Dominion in particular, have done a poor job of running energy efficiency programs. Looking on the bright side, though, that means plenty of opportunities remain.

House Democrats have already started work on this issue, with a focus on lowering winter heating costs for lower-income households. As reported in the Mercury last week, HB 2, from Farifax Del. Mark Sickles, requires Dominion and APCo to make their “best, reasonable efforts” to provide energy efficiency and weatherization to 30% of income-qualified customers by the end of 2031. HB 3, from Del. Destiny Levere Bolling, D-Henrico, sets up a task force to study income-qualified energy efficiency and weatherization.

These steps are okay for starters, and they would be juiced by the influx of money from RGGI carbon auctions (see next section), earmarked for low-income energy efficiency. But Dominion has repeatedly failed to meet the energy efficiency targets the legislature sets for it, and after all, why stop with 30% of low-income customers when all households could benefit from more comprehensive programs? Virginia can do much better.

My last column discussed Rewiring America’s proposal to have tech companies pay for heat pumps, solar and batteries in the residential sector, saving money for households and freeing up capacity for data centers to come online sooner. An independent provider could run the program and verify the energy savings.

(If the tech companies complain that an awful lot of the solutions I’m proposing come at their expense, it’s true. But the industry benefits from a state tax subsidy that has reached nearly a billion dollars per year, and will only grow further as the number of data centers doubles and triples. They can afford to give back.)

Use RGGI for long-term affordability. Gov.-elect Spanberger has committed to seeing Virginia rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the compact of northeastern states working to lower carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. RGGI works by requiring owners of carbon-emitting generating plants to buy carbon allowances at auction, penalizing carbon-intensive generation and rewarding investments in zero-carbon facilities like wind, solar and nuclear. States collect the auction proceeds, which in Virginia are dedicated to low-income energy efficiency and climate adaptation measures.

Republicans have already renewed their attacks on RGGI, calling it a tax on energy consumers. To the extent that’s true, it’s a tax mostly paid by the largest consumers (including data centers) for the benefit of low-income residents and people most vulnerable to storms and sea level rise. Moreover, all energy consumers benefit over the longer term as low-cost clean energy increasingly replaces expensive fossil fuels.

Beef up efficiency standards in the residential building code. Most people who buy a new home assume that modern building codes incorporate the latest standards for insulation and efficient technology. In Virginia, they do not. Buyers would be dismayed to learn that their homes are costing them more on their utility bills than they saved on a purchase price supposedly made more affordable by poorer-quality insulation and appliances. Buyers are rarely consulted on these trade-offs, and few have the expertise to question a builder’s choices. Building codes are supposed to do that job.

Unfortunately, Virginia’s Board of Housing and Community Development, which writes the code, is dominated by the homebuilding industry. The industry wants to build homes as cheaply as possible to ensure the highest profit possible on the homes it sells. Even as national model code standards have become more rigorous, homebuilders have protected their own interests by keeping weak energy efficiency requirements in Virginia’s residential building code.

In 2021, Virginia adopted legislation requiring the board to consider and adopt energy standards “at least as stringent as” the latest national model code standards when the benefits over time to residents and the public exceed the incremental costs of construction. But the board simply didn’t do it. Will this be the year legislators realize that a board dominated by the industry it regulates won’t act in the public interest without explicit directions?",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/53247147735_cacdab3c96_o-1024x7681764757152.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=y1ilRdic,N,,2025-12-03 06:57:51.548991

HOOSIER NEWS: The Midwest grid operator that serves Indiana is looking to fast-track more power plants through its interconnection process. MISO, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, said the grid needs power for AI data centers, manufacturing plants and electric vehicles. None of the projects the operator approved so far are in Indiana, but at least six in the state are eligible this round. MISO fast-tracked 10 energy projects in September. About half of them were natural gas plants and half were energy sources like solar, wind and battery storage. But in terms of megawatts, it was no contest. Natural gas made up about 80% of the capacity that was able to quickly connect to the grid. The Indiana energy projects eligible to speed through the queue are similarly split: half are natural gas and half are battery storage. About 73% of the megawatts proposed by NIPSCO and Duke Energy would come from gas. Renewable energy companies are concerned the high energy demand from things like data centers will allow natural gas projects to jump the line, even though many more clean energy sources are waiting to get connected.

NATIONAL NEWS: Waymo has released nearly 100 million miles of autonomous driving data showing its self-driving cars were involved in 91% fewer serious-injury crashes and 80% fewer injury crashes than human drivers on the same roads. The company also recorded 96% fewer injury-causing intersection crashes, with large reductions in pedestrian, cyclist and motorcycle-related crashes. While three incidents involving Waymo cars resulted in two deaths and one serious injury, all were caused by human-driven vehicles. The findings come as the U.S. continues to face 39,000 annual traffic deaths, highlighting the potential public health impact of wider autonomous vehicle adoption. (Dr. Jonathan Slotkin/NYT)

This Day in Shelby County History

Local headlines reported on or around this date in Shelby County history. Selections are curated by The Addison Times from Shelby County Public Library Genealogy Department materials.

2005: Demolition of Shelbyville’s old Fire Station No. 1 and several neighboring buildings began to make way for the new fire department headquarters. Mayor Scott Furgeson said the work would last about four weeks and would not impede traffic.

1995: Shelbyville defeated Columbus North in boys basketball, pulling away after an early exchange of leads. The Golden Bears honored longtime coach Bill Stearman before the game, marking his first return to Shelbyville as an opponent in more than 25 years.

1985: Overhead Door announced a $1.5 million expansion that was expected to add 50 to 60 jobs in Shelbyville, centered on a 47,000-square-foot addition, new office space and expanded manufacturing areas. The project also included replacing and enlarging the company’s St. Joe Street facility.

1975: St. Paul’s town board discussed several potential improvement projects, including purchasing the Triple Lakes property for a water supply and recreation area and converting the former Jones Bar-B-Q restaurant into a senior center or recreation facility. The board planned to set priorities once funding decisions were finalized.

1965: Southwestern High School planned its Student Council–sponsored Sno-Ball Dance with a “Silver Wonderland” theme and selected Dan South as the event’s disc jockey. In other school news, the marching Spartans prepared for a Saturday performance in Shelbyville, led by drum major Bob Cortelyou, head majorette Nancy Main, and a seven-member majorette and flag corps that included Karen Sandefur, Pat Hamner, Della Scheffler, Barb Hamner, Debbie Kendall and Connie Martin. The Stagelighters club also gathered to celebrate Larry Coffey’s birthday.

1955: The Shelbyville News published an article on Mrs. Russell (Reba) McNeely of Third Street, who grew more than 75 African violets using a “sign method” taught by a national growers’ organization, earning honors for plants started from show-winning stock. Her collection included many varieties in colors from deep purple to pastel pink, and she tended them under fluorescent lights with careful watering and grooming to produce balanced blooms. McNeely frequently exhibited her flowers, and belonged to a statewide violet club.

1945: Foundation work was underway for the new Nu-Kraft manufacturing plant on Meridian Street, facing the Shelbyville High School athletic field. Company president Russ Gross said operations would continue at the Shelby Shops until the new facility was finished, with the plant expected to house all manufacturing by March. The one-story structure was planned at roughly 225 feet long and 80 feet wide, and Shelby Woodcrafters, a Hallcrafters subsidiary, would occupy the factory to build radio cabinets.

A new federal rule by the Trump administration is expected to reduce regulatory burdens on farmers by narrowing the scope of federal oversight on the nation’s wetlands and other waterways.

Released last month by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the proposed rule carries out directives from the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA, ending years of regulatory uncertainty about how the Clean Water Act applies to working farmland.

The rule is designed to cut red tape and prevent federal overreach, EPA said, which could save farmers time and money by reducing permitting requirements for activities on their land. It provides a new definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, that aims to ensure that only relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes—and wetlands that are connected to and indistinguishable from such water bodies are federally regulated, EPA added.

Public comments on the proposed rule are due Jan. 5.

Farm groups, which have long called for clearer rules on WOTUS to simplify compliance for landowners, largely expressed support for the new definition, saying it brings much-needed clarity and ends years of shifting regulations that often led to confusion about what waters were under federal control and require a Clean Water Act permit.

Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation, called the proposed rule “a real positive step in the right direction,” as it provides a clear distinction between regulating major water bodies and farm-specific features such as ditches and ponds.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines,” AFBF President Zippy Duvall said, adding that the new rule “protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with.”

Since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, defining WOTUS has been one of the most complex and contentious issues in federal water policy. Due to lack of statutory language in the law, multiple administrations and courts have grappled with how far federal jurisdiction should reach on wetlands and water features. This has led to decades of conflicting court decisions, shifting regulatory interpretations, intense political debate and implementation challenges.

The 2015 rule under the Obama administration expanded federal protections to ephemeral and intermittent streams, as well as wetlands not directly adjacent to larger waterways.

In 2020, under the first Trump administration, the rule narrowed protections significantly, excluding wetlands, streams and other water bodies that were previously covered.

The Biden administration issued a new rule in 2023 that returned to the pre-2015 regulatory regime. Without incorporating the Sackett decision into the regulatory text, the Biden rule defined WOTUS as relatively permanent waters, such as traditional navigable waters, along with those with a continuous surface connection to them.

“Some ill-defined areas from the Sackett ruling compounded with updated guidance from the Biden administration has led to continued challenges with interpreting the regulation,” said Erin Huston, federal policy consultant for the California Farm Bureau.

The updated rule is meant to establish a “clear, durable, common-sense” WOTUS definition, EPA said, and clarifies whether farmers, landowners and businesses must secure permits before they pursue projects that might impact surface water quality.

“No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a water of the United States is on their property,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said.

Under the proposal, certain ditches, prior converted cropland, waste treatment systems and groundwater are not considered WOTUS—revisions that EPA said would “accelerate economic prosperity.” Ephemeral waters, or those with surface water flowing or standing due to rainfall or snow, also are not federally protected, according to the proposal.

In addition, the new rule defines “relatively permanent” water, which is federally regulated, as “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.”

EPA said the proposal protects water quality “by striking balance between federal and state authority, recognizing that states and tribes are best positioned to appropriately manage their local land and water resources.”

To that end, the federal rule does not change what California requires, as states retain authority to regulate waters within their borders and have their own protections for wetlands and water quality, said Kari Fisher, senior counsel for the California Farm Bureau.

She noted California’s Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act—which gives the California State Water Resources Control Board and the nine regional water quality control boards the authority to protect surface water, groundwater and wetlands—is more restrictive than the federal Clean Water Act and regulates more groundwater and surface water.

“The big question is if the state of California will in turn regulate even more if the new WOTUS rule is enacted,” Fisher said.

The state water board is expected to release a new report in the coming months that could provide more clarity on how it may change its water quality protection programs in light of the new WOTUS rule.

Last month, Ohio’s Mahoning Valley was hit once again with job cuts at the Ultium Cells battery plant; around 500 jobs lost, and 850 workers temporarily laid off.

The community spent years working to bring manufacturing jobs back to the area.

Workers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) spent additional years organizing the Ultium plant to ensure safety and living wages.

It is difficult to see the gains of these workers and this community lost again, and that basic ask from our community years ago, “invest in us” stays top of mind.

Since 1966, the Lordstown Complex employed thousands of Ohioans who showed up and worked hard, even as our jobs were threatened with offshoring and automation.

After I had the honor of being elected as President of Local UAW 1112, I did everything in my power to see a new vehicle brought to Lordstown.

We knew that plant had all the right stuff to be a herald of a revived American automotive industry, and our members were ready to get back to work.

We believed then, and continue to believe now, that our members are the backbone of our communities, our states, and our nation.

We have urged our representatives on both sides of the aisle to invest in workers and in communities like Lordstown across the country.

But for companies like Ultium, the passage of the Republican budget bill (the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) this past summer makes it clear that Congressional Republicans are willing to lay waste to these goals.

Ohio U.S. Sen. Jon Husted lauded the significant tax cuts in the bill, but failed to mention that these historic tax breaks for the ultra-rich come at steep cost for working people.

More than 410,000 workers are currently employed in manufacturing facilities like Ultium that build the next generation of clean vehicles or their components.

This includes more than 240,000 manufacturing jobs in the domestic electric vehicle (EV) supply chain alone.

Many of these jobs are supported by federal policies and regulations, including the 30D EV tax credits and the 45X subsidies.

The UAW believes that incentives like these need stronger protections for workers attached, to make sure public dollars are only used to create good union jobs.

But instead of working with us to improve the credits, Republicans used their budget bill to eliminate them altogether, throwing companies that produce EVs and their parts into uncertainty.

The Ultium plant in Ohio is not an outlier.

Significant layoffs at GM’s Factory Zero and Rivian were also announced last month, as were temporary layoffs at Ultium’s Tennessee plant.

The loss of jobs at these facilities is not only a loss for the workers, but also a loss for all of us who live and work in these communities.

These plants uphold local economies, build innovative technologies that position the United States to compete in an advancing global marketplace, and ultimately, produce safe, reliable American cars.

In the plants we organized, the UAW worked to ensure these jobs were good jobs, safe jobs, where workers were able to achieve significant union-backed wage increases and benefits to support themselves and their families.

Facilities like Ultium proved that auto workers building parts and components for clean vehicles could receive the strong union protections and benefits they deserve.

In April, the Partnership for Public Service—a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the federal government—found DOGE’s actions had cost taxpayers around $135 billion in its first 100 days through the loss of federal worker productivity, repeated fire-and-rehire cycles and paid leave.

This figure does not account for the costs of defending the many lawsuits filed against DOGE, nor any potential decline in tax collections caused by cuts to IRS personnel.

“The main problem with this whole initiative is that it seems to have taken a scattershot approach to cutting government rather than a thoughtful approach of targeting where the inefficiencies truly lie,"" Gruber told Newsweek.

Goldman Sachs Research estimates that the electricity demand from data centers worldwide will increase 50% by 2027 and up to 165% by 2030 from 2023 levels. This rapid increase is straining power grids globally with a massive volume of new capacity being built and connected, notably in Northern Virginia where 20GW of data center capacity is being added along with other US markets. This is resulting in data centers and other large loads being forced to wait until utilities and grid operators can prepare and ensure sufficient generation and delivery capacity. BluWave-ai Data Center Autopilot will allow for operation with much lower grid connection build-out.

RMI reports in a recent paper: In Northern Virginia Dominion Energy is warning that new data center connections may have to wait up to 7 years for connection, and in Dallas-Fort Worth some data center delivery dates are delayed until 2027 or later. Grid operators are seeing similar issues in Canada and worldwide. Hydro-Quebec expects data center power to grow by 7 times <[2] > and connection applications are being delayed or rejected. In British Columbia, the government is restricting data center energy use until the system is able to provide the capacity.

To meet this challenge, there is an opportunity to mitigate demand by throttling applications that are not time-critical running in data centers. Using patent-pending technology from BluWave-ai, the Data Center Autopilot realizes this by moving tasks that can be scheduled to operate at times where grid congestion and energy costs are lower, smoothing out spiky AI workloads while maintaining quality of service and uptime.

""The data center industry is struggling to balance immense growth with the imperative for sustainability and grid reliability. Our experience and proven technology for optimizing the grid using electric vehicles and renewable energy storage has given us a unique position to solve this problem,"" said Thomas Triplet VP of Engineering at BluWave-ai. ""The BluWave-ai Data Center Autopilot leverages our patented approach to translate what's going on in the grid into an actionable signal for data center application workloads. This means data centers and their associated applications can finally act as a sophisticated, flexible partner to the grid, with up to 35% reduction of the peak electricity utilization. This effectively enables data center owners to achieve significant cost savings while lowering their carbon footprint.""

""The strain that hyperscale AI is putting on the grid is a major concern for all colocation providers, especially as we commit to meeting aggressive sustainability goals. BluWave-ai's approach is unique because it goes beyond facility-level controls to address the power demands at the rack and application level,"" said Mike Lalonde, Co-founder at Purecolo. ""Integrating Data Center Autopilot allows us to provide our customers with a truly granular demand response capability, ensuring we can optimize workloads to align with the grid's real-time cost and carbon intensity. This partnership is a key step for Purecolo to manage volatility, offer superior quality of service, and deliver on our promise of a more efficient, net-zero-ready data center.""

Built on BluWave-ai's patented AI energy optimization technology, the Data Center Autopilot provides:

Applications Owner Benefits: Application owners who have not time sensitive applications can subscribe to the service and opt in to energy use reduction during grid constrained times and receive a direct revenue stream from BluWave-ai reducing their overall cost of operations. BluWave-ai aggregates multiple applications within a data center or across data centers in an electricity system operator service area

Data Center Operator Benefits: The platform provides joint optimization for all connected assets (on-site batteries, data center management system and applications) to perform peak demand reduction and energy arbitrage. This delivers a demonstrable ROI with net reduction in total electricity expenditure and measurable improvements in power usage efficiency using existing hardware assets.

ESG and Carbon Emissions Reduction: By preferentially scheduling workloads to run during periods of high renewable energy availability, the solution actively helps operators achieve aggressive carbon usage effectiveness targets and meet net-zero sustainability mandates which are quantified by the platform for ESG reporting purposes

The system uses a proprietary, predictive signal, BluScore™ which communicates the real-time cost, carbon intensity, and availability of grid power. This signal is consumed by the BluWave-ai AI optimizer to automatically throttle, pause, or shift non-critical workloads, containers, or individual applications. This precision ensures quality of service for mission-critical functions is maintained while enabling participation with highly granular demand response and other electricity market services.

The solution operates on the BluWave-ai Infrastructure Cube, already deployed across Canada to seamlessly connect with utilities, system operators and with BluWave-ai's other Smart Grid Optimizer solutions. The platform standardizes and handles ""dirty data"" from the grid providing more accurate grid predictions for optimal control in concert with other electricity consumers and producers, supporting the power grid. It also coordinates with other distributed energy resources on the grid such as any available on-site battery energy storage at data centers, providing further opportunities for participation in demand response and energy arbitrage further improving net operating costs.

""With the large volume in grid interconnection requested and ramp in loads from existing data center operators, distribution grids are constrained given the increasing electrification coming from general grid loads and EVs, "" said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai, ""Our Data center Autopilot will allow non-time-sensitive data center loads to self throttle as much as 100 percent during grid constrained periods. This capability is operational across Canada with EVs and we're bringing the capability to data center applications. For a 100MW group of non-time-sensitive applications such as AI model training or other batch processing compute intensive applications, our simulations for a weekly load suggest the potential for a drop from 100MW peak loads to an average of less than 65MW peak""

Autumn Budget 2025: the Energy Profits Levy, renewables, nuclear, electric vehicles and energy infrastructure

On 26 November 2025, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered the Autumn 2025 Budget, introducing important changes affecting the Energy sector. Announcements include:

The Energy Profits Levy windfall tax will be replaced by an Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM). The levy, introduced in 2022, will remain in effect until the earlier of March 2030 or on the triggering of the Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM), at which point the new OGPM will take effect, also triggering the tax rate to return to the flat 40% ""headline"" tax, which will continue as a permanent regime. (The ESIM was established as a trigger such that if the six-month average price of both oil and gas drops below $71.40/barrel for oil and £0.54/therm for gas, thereby returning to ""historically norma"" prices, the Energy Price Levy would cease to apply.) The OGPM imposes a 35% charge on revenues above ""unusually high"" price thresholds of $90/barrel for oil and £0.90/therm for gas. It is intended that the OGPM will be legislated in the next Finance Bill.

The government will publicly fund 75% of the domestic legacy costs of the Renewables Obligation from 2026-27 to 2028-29. As recently reported, there is an ongoing consultation in relation to the indexation of the Renewables Obligation. Paired with ending the Energy Company Obligation, this is projected to reduce average household energy bills by around £150 in 2026-27. These changes will take effect from 1 April 2026.

The British Industry Supercharger, providing energy bill relief for energy-intensive industries, received an uplift. The Network Charging Compensation Scheme relief, which compensates eligible businesses against the cost of using the Great British Electricity Grid, will rise from 60% to 90%.

Nuclear energy will be introduced as an eligible use of funds under the UK Green Financing Framework. However, proceeds from green gilts and Green Savings Bonds issued before 27 November 2025 will not be used for nuclear projects. See further on nuclear developments below.

Electricity used to produce electrolytic hydrogen will be exempt from the Climate Change Levy (CCL). See more on the CCL below.

The introduction of a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme from 2027, which the government states will reduce the electricity costs for over 7,000 businesses by up to £40/MWh. Support is intended for manufacturing ""frontier industries within the Industrial Strategy's growth sectors and foundational manufacturing industries that provide key inputs to the frontier's industries which meet a certain threshold of electricity intensity"". The consultation opened on 24 November and will close on 19 January 2026; responses should be submitted to: bics.correspondence@businessandtrade.gov.uk.

The Carbon Price Support rates (the minimum floor price for carbon) in Great Britain will be frozen in 2027-28 at a ""level equivalent to"" £18 per tonne of CO2.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids will pay a per-mile levy from April 2028. The self-reported charge for EVs will be ""half the equivalent fuel duty rate for petrol and diesel cars, and plug-in hybrid cars will pay a reduced rate equivalent to half of the electric car rate"".

Government releases report on Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce review

On 26 November, the government published a report on the Nuclear Regulatory Review 2025. The review identifies regulation as central to the UK's relative decline in nuclear competitiveness, with the increasing complexity and risk aversion of the regulatory system contributing to a weakening of the UK's leadership position.

It diagnoses five primary regulatory problems: (i) fragmented oversight with multiple regulators and no designated lead; (ii) disproportionate decisions that are overly conservative and costly; (iii) flawed legislation prioritising process over outcomes; (iv) government indecision in policymaking and regulatory roles; and (v) weak industry incentives due to near-monopolistic market structures.

The review proposes reforms that include a new Commission on Nuclear Regulation as a one-stop decision-maker for major approvals, which has been proposed to address the issues in current oversight identified by the taskforce. Interim steps entail a formal lead regulator model (the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) as default) and merging the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator (DNSR) into ONR. These structural recommendations complement earlier government initiatives analysed in this previous update, which covers parallel reforms in regulatory, planning and delivery frameworks.

Following the publication of the report, the prime minister's strategic steer endorses all recommendations, committing to full implementation within two years (subject to legislative timelines). It ties reforms to broader policies: a new National Policy Statement for Nuclear Energy Generation beyond 2025, Planning and Infrastructure Bill changes, and forthcoming SMR/advanced nuclear frameworks.

Government launches North Sea Future Plan

The government has published its response to the 'Building the North Sea's Energy Future' consultation, setting out a framework for managing the transition of the North Sea basin from traditional oil and gas production towards clean energy industries. The North Sea Plan seeks to implement the government's manifesto commitments to manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan and not to issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields.

To implement this framework, the government has outlined a few measures listed below:

Transitional Energy Certificates: A key part of the government’s response is the introduction of Transitional Energy Certificates, which allow limited oil and gas production on or near existing fields without new exploration. This mechanism supports an orderly transition by permitting development linked to existing infrastructure (""tiebacks""), consistent with the commitment to halt new exploration licences. Developers cannot explore new sites, and some uncertainty remains over how the framework will apply to larger projects extending into unlicensed seabed areas.

Regulatory and licensing reforms: Primary legislation will amend the North Sea Transition Authority’s (NSTA) statutory objectives to balance maximising economic value, supporting net zero delivery and assessing long-term transition impacts on workers, communities and supply chains. Decisions on field extensions, emissions and decommissioning will incorporate these factors, aligning with the Climate Change Act and the Paris Agreement. The ban extends to new onshore licences in England (effectively ending fracking), while stricter rules on flaring, venting and platform electrification accelerate decarbonisation of legacy assets.

Workforce transition support: A new North Sea Jobs Service, launching in 2026, will provide career transition support for oil and gas workers into clean energy, defence and manufacturing, building on the expanded Energy Skills Passport and £20 million UK/Scottish funding from the Aberdeen pilot. A minister-led North Sea Future Board, with industry and union representation, will oversee coordination, alongside a five-year basin-wide supply chain plan and a Fair Work Charter standardising employment rights across sectors.

Investment in clean energy infrastructure: The plan sits alongside substantial government investment commitments, specifically across offshore wind, CCUS and hydrogen. The government intends to develop a comprehensive guidance package for supply chain businesses and improve certainty for investors.

As next steps, the government will launch a new minister-led delivery board of experts from across the industry and trade unions, who will meet regularly to oversee the progress, coordination and long-term planning of the North Sea's industrial transition.

Government publishes response to consultation on Climate Change Levy costs for low-carbon electrolytic hydrogen

The government has published its response to the consultation on the proposal for CCL no longer to be charged on electricity used in the electrolytic process for the production of green hydrogen. The existing CCL application to hydrogen provides ""green"" hydrogen (that which is electrolysed using renewable energy) less favourable treatment than ""grey"" or ""blue"" hydrogen (which uses steam reformation from natural gas) which already benefited from an exemption from the CCL. As previously reported, the government had therefore committed in this year's Spring Statement to remove the costs from green hydrogen production and this consultation was to consider the most appropriate legislative route to doing so.

The consultation response confirms that the government will proceed with its proposal to add electricity used in electrolysis to produce hydrogen to CCL's ""non-fuel use"" exemption. As this exemption is designed to only exempt ""non-fuel"" uses, only electricity used in the electrolysis process itself will be eligible for relief.

Despite suggestion in the original consultation that the selection of this approach could see changes implemented by the end of 2025, the response paper confirms that the changes will be implemented by spring 2026.

Opportunity Scaling with Next-Generation Geothermal Technologies One of the most promising growth opportunities for geothermal power generation lies in next-generation technologies that could massively expand where geothermal plants can be built.","Report Overview

The Global Geothermal Power Generation Market size is expected to be worth around USD 20.4 Billion by 2034, from USD 9.2 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 8.3% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, Asia-Pacific held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 38.6% share, holding USD 3.5 Billion revenue.

Geothermal power generation refers to producing electricity from heat stored beneath the earth’s surface, typically via dry steam, flash steam or binary-cycle plants. It offers firm, low-carbon baseload power with a very small land footprint, so it plays a strategic role alongside variable renewables like wind and solar in long-term decarbonisation plans. However, it remains a niche technology in today’s power mix, concentrated in a limited number of countries with high-quality resources.

On the supply side, global geothermal power capacity is still modest. REN21 estimates that only about 14.8 GW of geothermal power capacity was operating worldwide in 2023, after just 0.1 GW of new additions that year. IRENA likewise reports that geothermal electricity capacity has grown at around 3.5% per year since 2000 to roughly 16 GW in 2021, yet this represents only about 0.5% of total installed renewable electricity capacity. In terms of output, the U.S. EIA notes that 24 countries generated about 92 billion kWh of geothermal electricity in 2022.

Despite its small scale, geothermal is important in several national systems. In 2022, Indonesia produced around 17 billion kWh of geothermal power, equal to roughly 5% of its total electricity, while Kenya generated about 5 billion kWh, meeting approximately 45% of its annual electricity demand from geothermal plants. Governments are pushing to expand this role: Indonesia’s power development plan targets roughly 5.2 GW of geothermal capacity by 2034, implying a near-doubling from current levels, alongside a specific goal to add 3.3 GW of new geothermal capacity by 2030.

Several structural drivers underpin the industry. Geothermal plants provide 24/7 low-emission power with very low direct CO₂ emissions, and global net-zero scenarios assume a much larger contribution from such firm clean sources. The IEA’s Net Zero pathway projects that clean energy investment overall must rise to about USD 4 trillion per year by 2030, more than triple today’s levels, with geothermal among the technologies expected to scale in suitable regions. In parallel, geothermal already accounts for less than 1% of global electricity, highlighting a large untapped technical resource.

Cost trends are becoming more favorable. IRENA’s latest cost assessment finds that the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for geothermal fell by about 16% in 2024, from roughly USD 0.072/kWh to USD 0.060/kWh, narrowing the gap with other mature renewables and remaining within a relatively stable range over the last five years.

Asia-Pacific region accounted for 38.6% of the global geothermal power market, representing approximately USD 3.5 billion.

By Component Analysis

Turbine leads with 34.8% — driven by its central role in energy conversion and operational reliability.

In 2024, Turbine held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 34.8% share, as turbines continued to be recognised as the principal component converting geothermal steam and fluid enthalpy into usable electrical power. Investment and maintenance emphasis was placed on turbine efficiency and materials that withstand corrosive geothermal fluids, and incremental design improvements were implemented to raise thermal-to-electric conversion rates while lowering downtime.

Suppliers and plant operators prioritised turbomachinery upgrades and balance-of-plant integration to secure predictable output and extend operating life, which reinforced the turbine segment’s market lead. In 2025, the turbine component remained a focal point for capital expenditure and performance optimisation, with engineered upgrades and retrofits being pursued to improve reliability and reduce levelised cost of electricity — actions that are expected to sustain the turbine’s influential position within geothermal power systems.

By Type Analysis

Flash Steam leads with 47.6% — favoured for high-energy output from deep, high-temperature reservoirs.

In 2024, Flash Steam held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 47.6% share, as developers and utilities continued to select this type for reservoirs with high enthalpy and abundant steam supply. The technology’s ability to convert high-temperature, high-pressure fluid into steam for direct turbine driving delivers strong power density per well and predictable baseload output, which reduces the number of wells required for a given capacity and improves project economics.

Plant designers and operators have prioritised flash systems where reservoir conditions permit, because installation and commissioning timelines are well understood and retrofit paths exist for many legacy fields. Into 2025, flash steam is expected to retain its lead as new high-enthalpy projects and targeted retrofits proceed, supported by ongoing improvements in corrosion-resistant materials, turbine efficiency and balance-of-plant integration that together lower operational risk and enhance long-term asset value.

By Power Plant Size Analysis

Large-scale plants lead with 59.2% — driven by economies of scale and stronger grid integration.

In 2024, Large-scale Plants held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 59.2% share, as utility-grade geothermal installations continued to be preferred for bulk power delivery and long-term capacity planning. Project developers and system owners favoured large plants because they allow cost dilution across higher output, enable more attractive financing through predictable revenue streams, and simplify grid interconnection compared with many small, distributed units.

Investment was concentrated in steam-dominant and high-enthalpy fields where a single large plant can deliver baseload power with lower levelised cost of electricity; engineering effort was therefore directed toward optimized wellfield layouts, turbine selection and corrosion-resistant materials to secure long plant life and steady availability. Policy support and utility procurement practices that prioritise firm, dispatchable renewable capacity further reinforced large-plant economics in 2024. Into 2025, deployment activity was expected to remain skewed toward large-scale projects where resource quality and transmission access permit, while modular and small-scale solutions continued to be used selectively for remote or constrained sites.

By Site Analysis

Onshore dominates with 92.4% due to easier resource access and lower project risk.

In 2024, Onshore held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 92.4% share, as most geothermal power generation continued to rely on well-mapped, land-based reservoirs that offer predictable drilling conditions and lower development costs. Onshore sites were preferred because they provide stable geological profiles, faster permitting timelines, and easier integration with existing transmission networks, which collectively reduce overall project risk. Most global capacity additions in 2024 were directed toward high-potential volcanic belts and sedimentary basins where drilling depths remain manageable and well productivity supports long-term baseload output.

In 2025, the onshore segment is expected to maintain its lead as governments and utilities continue prioritising firm renewable power, and as ongoing investment focuses on resource expansion, wellfield optimization, and improved drilling efficiency. While offshore geothermal exploration is gradually advancing, its share remains minimal due to uncertainties related to seabed geology, high capital intensity, and complex environmental approvals. The overall market structure therefore remains firmly anchored in onshore development, which continues to provide the most reliable, economically feasible, and technically mature pathway for geothermal power generation.

By Deployment Type Analysis

New deployments dominate with 67.3% due to active project pipelines and policy backing.

In 2024, New Deployments held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 67.3% share, as capital was primarily allocated to greenfield geothermal projects and new wellfield development rather than to retrofits or expansions of existing plants. This preference was driven by pipeline economics, where fresh resource development offered clearer capacity additions per well and more attractive long-term returns for investors; permitting and financing frameworks in several markets were aligned to support new builds, and developers were incentivised to secure first-mover sites with high enthalpy potential.

Project delivery was focused on front-end engineering, drilling campaigns and turbine procurement, while risk-mitigation efforts such as detailed reservoir characterisation and staged drilling strategies were implemented to protect investment. In 2025, new-build activity was expected to remain the primary growth driver, with continued allocation of industry capex toward site development and early-stage project execution.

By Industry Verticals Analysis

Industrial leads with 49.1% — driven by steady on-site energy needs and process heat demand.

In 2024, Industrial held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 49.1% share, as geothermal power solutions were primarily adopted by industrial operators requiring reliable baseload power and low-cost heat for processes such as manufacturing, food processing, and mineral treatment. Large consumers favoured geothermal because it provided consistent output, reduced exposure to fuel price volatility, and delivered combined heat-and-power benefits that improved overall site economics; as a result, capital was directed toward integrated plant solutions and long-term offtake arrangements that lowered levelised energy costs and supported financing.

During 2024–2025, deployment activity for industrial applications was sustained by policy incentives for decarbonisation, increased corporate commitments to lower scope-2 emissions, and technology improvements that reduced drilling and balance-of-plant risk. Consequently, interest from heavy energy users and cluster developments was reinforced, with system designs increasingly tailored to deliver both electricity and process heat at required temperature ranges. Overall, the industrial vertical remained the principal demand centre for geothermal power, driven by operational stability, fuel-cost savings and the capacity to substitute fossil-fuel heat with low-emission geothermal energy.

Emerging Trends

Rising Capacity Additions and Broader Use

One of the most noteworthy recent trends in geothermal power generation is the uptick in global capacity additions and the growing ambition to use geothermal for both electricity and heat. According to the IEA’s “The Future of Geothermal Energy” report, by the end of 2024 global geothermal capacity reached roughly 15.1 GW, helped by a surge in new installations — at least 400 MW was added in 2024 alone.

This trend reflects a shift: geothermal is no longer just a niche source for a few active volcanic regions — it’s emerging as a cleaner, stable option for more countries. Because geothermal plants deliver steady, around-the-clock output, they offer what other renewables struggle with: firm, dispatchable power. The IEA notes that geothermal capacity utilization rates have exceeded 75% in 2023, much higher than typical wind or solar installations.

What makes this trend heartening is that improving technology and policy support are helping overcome past limitations. The IEA highlights advances in “next-generation geothermal” — for example, engineered deep systems that can tap heat from deep rock layers rather than naturally hot aquifers — opening geothermal’s reach to many areas previously considered unsuitable.

For countries thinking long-term about clean and reliable power, this renewed interest in geothermal means opportunities: not just in new build-outs, but also in integrating geothermal heat for industry and buildings, improving energy security, and reducing carbon emissions. If the momentum continues, geothermal may increasingly become part of the backbone of stable, renewable-heavy power systems worldwide — not just a small add-on.a

Drivers

Rising Need for 24/7 Clean Electricity Drives Geothermal Power Growth

One of the strongest driving factors for geothermal power generation is the global push for reliable, round-the-clock clean electricity. Unlike solar or wind, geothermal plants operate continuously, making them highly valuable for stabilizing power grids while cutting emissions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), geothermal plants typically operate at capacity factors above 70%, compared with about 25% for solar and 35% for wind, highlighting their baseload advantage.

Governments are increasingly recognizing this value as electricity demand rises from electrification of transport, heating, and industry. The International Energy Agency (IEA) states that global electricity demand grew by about 2.4% in 2023 and is expected to accelerate further as electric vehicles and heat pumps expand. This growth creates pressure on grids to add clean power sources that are not dependent on weather, directly supporting geothermal deployment in suitable regions.

National energy strategies clearly reflect this shift. The U.S. Department of Energy announced in 2023 a funding program of USD 60 million specifically for enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), aiming to unlock geothermal resources beyond traditional volcanic areas. The DOE estimates that EGS alone could support up to 90 GW of U.S. geothermal capacity by 2050, enough to power tens of millions of homes while maintaining grid reliability.

Developing economies also view geothermal as an energy-security solution. Kenya’s Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority reports that geothermal already supplies about 45% of the country’s electricity, reducing dependence on hydropower that is vulnerable to drought. This reliability has helped Kenya avoid power shortages during dry seasons and stabilize household electricity prices.

Restraints

High Upfront Drilling Risk and Capital Cost Limit Large-Scale Adoption

The biggest restraining factor for geothermal power generation is the high upfront cost and financial risk linked to exploration and drilling. Unlike solar or wind projects, geothermal plants must confirm underground heat resources before power generation begins. This requires deep drilling, which is expensive and uncertain. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) states that exploration and drilling alone can account for 30% to 50% of total project capital costs, even before a single unit of electricity is produced.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), around 20–25% of exploratory geothermal wells globally fail to deliver commercially usable heat or flow rates. These failed wells generate no return, yet their full drilling cost must still be absorbed, making financiers cautious about funding early-stage geothermal projects.

Capital intensity further slows projects in emerging economies. The World Bank estimates that developing a single geothermal well can cost between USD 3 million and USD 10 million, depending on depth and location. For a typical commercial plant requiring multiple wells, upfront investment quickly rises above USD 100 million, which is challenging for countries with limited access to low-cost financing.

Governments are trying to reduce this barrier, but progress is gradual. The U.S. Department of Energy notes that drilling costs have declined only about 10–15% over the past decade, far slower than the rapid cost reductions seen in solar or wind technologies. This slower learning curve limits geothermal’s competitiveness in energy auctions focused mainly on lowest upfront price.

In developing regions, public risk-sharing mechanisms are essential but still limited. The World Bank’s Global Geothermal Development Plan has mobilized about USD 200 million for risk‐mitigation funding since launch, yet this covers only a fraction of global project pipelines.

Opportunity

Scaling with Next-Generation Geothermal Technologies

One of the most promising growth opportunities for geothermal power generation lies in next-generation technologies that could massively expand where geothermal plants can be built. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if technological improvements continue and costs are brought down, geothermal could supply as much as 800 GW of global capacity by 2050 — a huge jump from today’s roughly 15–16 GW.

That kind of capacity could meet up to 15% of global electricity demand growth between now and 2050. Such growth would transform geothermal from a niche, regional energy source into a central backbone of clean energy systems worldwide — offering stable, low-emission baseload power alongside solar and wind.

This opportunity is especially significant for regions with limited surface-level geothermal resources today. With “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS) and advanced drilling, even areas without classic volcanic or high-enthalpy geology could tap deep heat reservoirs. The IEA notes that harnessing only a small fraction of global geothermal potential — including these unconventional resources — could transform energy access in many developing regions.

On the policy side, several governments are beginning to support geothermal through incentive programmes, funding for demonstration projects, and streamlined regulation — making the economics more favourable for new entrants. As policy and technology align, geothermal could emerge as a core component of clean-energy transformation across many parts of the world.

Regional Insights

Asia Pacific leads with 38.6% — valued at USD 3.5 billion, driven by rich geothermal resources and rapid project development.

In 2024, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 38.6% of the global geothermal power market, representing approximately USD 3.5 billion, a position supported by large resource endowments in Indonesia, the Philippines and emerging projects in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The region’s share reflects both sizeable installed capacity and an active pipeline: global geothermal capacity approached ~15 GW by 2023, with Asia-Pacific nations contributing a material portion of recent additions and pipeline projects.

Technology improvements—better corrosion-resistant materials, modern turbines and enhanced geothermal system (EGS) pilots—have raised plant load factors and lowered levelised costs, improving the economics of both flash and binary plants across varied reservoir types in the region.

Key Players Analysis

Alterra Power’s geothermal, hydro and wind assets were integrated into Innergex following a C$1.1 billion acquisition; the combined group increased renewable capacity materially and preserved Alterra’s geothermal project pipeline. Alterra’s project portfolio historically spanned multiple countries and included utility-scale geothermal sites and development rights. Post-acquisition, the legacy Alterra geothermal assets have been managed within Innergex’s broader renewable platform, supporting ongoing operations, project development and cross-technology optimisation across hydro, wind and geothermal resources.

Turboden designs and supplies Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems for geothermal and waste-heat recovery, focusing on medium-to-low enthalpy resources and modular plant solutions. Its portfolio includes multi-megawatt ORC units and numerous global installations, supporting power outputs up to ~40 MWe per generator and several hundred megawatts of installed capacity. In 2024 the firm continued to expand project deliveries and partnerships to deploy binary and ORC units for geothermal and industrial sites, reinforcing its role as an ORC specialist.

Atlas Copco supplies compressors, vacuum solutions and rotating equipment used across geothermal drilling, binary turbine balance-of-plant and plant maintenance activities. The group’s wide service footprint and rotating-equipment expertise support reliability and uptime for geothermal operators. In 2024 the Group reported revenues of BSEK 177, reflecting its broad industrial scale and capacity to support large equipment and aftermarket services for energy infrastructure.

From an event hall in Bozeman, Montana, a small city in the American Midwest, Gov. Jenniffer González said in mid-October that “Puerto Rico should be the showcase of how American Energy Dominance can be [done].”

She was referring to President Donald Trump’s energy policy, which seeks to position the United States as the global leader in energy exports, driven by fossil fuels such as oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power, an option González had publicly dismissed just a month earlier.

Beyond the political alignment already visible between Trump and González Colón, some argue that Trump’s energy agenda for Puerto Rico should be even more expansive.

In an opinion column published in August, Justin Peterson, a Washington, D.C. lobbyist close to Trump and a former member of Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Control Board, proposed that the federal government take charge of privatizing and rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power system, anchored in natural gas and nuclear energy.

“The Presidential Council for Energy Dominance and the Department of Energy should lead this effort, working with a potentially reconstituted [Board],” Peterson wrote, after the White House removed five of the Board’s seven members in August.

The Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (CPI) asked La Fortaleza whether González Colón’s support for Trump’s energy agenda, as she stated in Montana, also extends to Peterson’s proposal.

“We respect Mr. Peterson’s opinion. He’s no longer part of the Board. He’s not an elected official. Obviously, as a colony, there are many people who like everything to be federalized,” said Jean Peña Payano, a legislative adviser to the Governor.

According to him, the González administration will pursue anything that helps achieve “energy relief and getting LUMA out.”

“If that includes [implementing Trump’s energy policy], we’ll gladly do it,” he added.

The CPI reached out, through a White House spokesperson, to the National Energy Dominance Council, a new executive office created by Trump to facilitate and accelerate projects aligned with this vision, but received no response.

Under the banner of “energy dominance,” Trump rolled back environmental regulations and sped up permit approvals for activities related to the extraction and export of fossil fuels, nonrenewable energy sources. In a recent proclamation declaring October 2025 as National Energy Dominance Month, Trump said that “three simple words” define America’s energy future: “Drill, baby, drill.”

Although “American Energy Dominance” has barely been discussed in Puerto Rico, the González administration has been implementing Trump’s energy agenda almost verbatim.

During her appearance at the Big Sky, Bright Future Economic Summit, a forum hosted by Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, the Governor boasted that extending the life of the AES coal plant until 2032. The facility had been scheduled to shut down next year. She criticized the Biden administration’s strategy of prioritizing federal funds for renewable energy projects and pointed to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, as the main obstacle to lowering energy costs.

She also highlighted her first law in office, which eliminated the intermediate benchmarks established years ago requiring Puerto Rico to reach 100% renewable energy by 2050.

But if anything was unmistakable during her participation, it was her embrace of U.S.-sourced liquefied natural gas (LNG) as Puerto Rico’s primary energy source.

“I believe in American LNG,” González said repeatedly while discussing the $4 billion contract she signed with New Fortress Energy (NFE) to supply natural gas for seven years, a deal that had, until then, been rejected by the Fiscal Control Board.

On Friday, Nov. 28, the Board announced it had approved the NFE contract, but warned that even with the revisions made to the agreement, the company would retain a monopoly over the supply of that fuel at the Port of San Juan.

“This lack of competition affects the reliability of the energy system, prices, and Puerto Rico’s overall economic competitiveness,” the Board said.

Puerto Rico bets on gas again

This is not the first time Puerto Rico has pinned its hopes on natural gas. Over the past 20 years, governors from both major political parties have promoted the use of this fossil fuel under the premise that it would lower energy costs on the island.

Under former Gov. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, construction began on the ill-fated “southern gas pipeline,” intended to transport gas from Peñuelas to Salinas. Then came Gov. Luis Fortuño, who also failed in his attempt to build the “northern gas pipeline,” known as Vía Verde, designed to move gas from the island’s south to its north. In the 2014 energy reform signed by Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, natural gas was framed as a “transition” fuel on the way toward renewable energy.

During the Ricardo Rosselló administration, two years after the cancellation of the Aguirre Offshore GasPort project in 2017, NFE arrived as the main gas supplier and to build a new receiving terminal. Its inauguration was celebrated in 2020 by then-Gov. Wanda Vázquez. And in his final week in office, Pedro Pierluisi laid the foundation stone for the new gas-fired plant now under construction in San Juan by the Energiza consortium.

But the Governor’s plans for natural gas, including the new contract with NFE, tie Puerto Rico’s energy future to this fossil fuel, placing the island’s goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2050 at risk.

In addition, the generation projects announced by her administration would result in an energy surplus in Puerto Rico, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), and would drive up electricity costs.

Of the 1,200 megawatts the Governor claims to have added to the grid in the past 10 months “just by fixing old plants,” nearly half relies on natural gas. And although the Energiza plant was initiated under former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, González has continued its construction; it would add 450 megawatts powered by liquefied natural gas. Fourteen emergency generators left behind by FEMA also run on this fossil fuel. Meanwhile, the private operator Genera PR, which manages the former Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority generation fleet, is pursuing projects to convert most of those plants to natural gas.

This administration also approved three new generation projects in October that would collectively add 800 megawatts, primarily through diesel. That same month, the Government released a new request for proposals for up to 3,000 megawatts of additional generation.

“If these plans materialize, Puerto Rico will have far more capacity than it needs, and this problem will only worsen in the future as residents and businesses continue adopting rooftop solar with battery storage,” said Cathy Kunkel, an Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) consultant.

Those who remain connected to the centralized power system would face higher electricity costs because of these inefficiencies.

To supply nearly 100% of the natural gas the island needs, the González administration selected NFE, the parent company of Genera PR.

“What I did over the summer is that I renegotiated a deal to bring more LNG to the island, because we need to move forward from petroleum, and I cut from $20 billion to $4 billion a contract of LNG for the island and I’ve been waiting since June to get it approved by this federal board. […] I believe in American LNG,” González said in Montana.

The Governor was referring to the Fiscal Control Board. However, she did not clarify that her administration had tried unsuccessfully to execute the same contract, at 15 years and $20 billion. At the time, the Board rejected the agreement, noting that it would establish a monopoly over fuel supply, among other concerns.

In September, a renegotiated version of the contract was announced, this time for seven years and $4 billion. Although González claimed her administration removed a clause preventing another supplier from entering the market if NFE failed to meet its obligations, the Board raised new objections in October regarding the contract’s language.

Late Friday night, the Fiscal Control Board announced its conditional approval of the contract, requiring revisions to a separate agreement between NFE and the Government that governs the entry of other gas suppliers into the Port of San Juan if NFE is unable to do so.

Regarding this deal, IEEFA warned that, in addition to the possibility that Puerto Rico may end up buying more gas than it needs, the Government would remain tied to a company facing serious financial troubles.

As the CPI revealed in 2022, NFE has repeatedly failed to deliver natural gas as agreed, forcing the Government to purchase diesel, a more expensive fuel whose cost is passed directly to customers through higher electricity bills.

As part of its approval of the NFE contract, the Board required the Government to prepare “an evaluation of the amounts that should be returned to the people of Puerto Rico to compensate for diesel expenses incurred as a result of NFE’s delivery failures under existing contracts.”

This report must be submitted no later than March of next year.

Energy Dominance Council

Trump created the National Energy Dominance Council in February through an executive order. The Council is led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and its mission is to fast-track projects that “help America at home, help us sell energy overseas,” explained Executive Director Jarrod Agen in an interview.

Agen, who also advises Burgum and previously served as communications director for Vice President Mike Pence, said the Council works with the oil, gas, and mining sectors to advance projects that, in his view, have been stuck in permitting processes for years.

“We’ve been very effective — because we didn’t bring in a bunch of academics. We took people directly from industry in particular areas — oil and gas, coal, mining, and nuclear. And so, we have a very small team. It’s a start-up within the White House,” Agen said in September.

Trump also canceled renewable energy programs funded with federal dollars, some of which were intended for solar and battery projects in Puerto Rico, eliminated restrictions on oil burning, and opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to fossil fuel exploration.

The measures taken by Trump have largely benefited the oil and gas industry, which financially supported his 2024 presidential campaign. One of the key figures behind shaping Trump’s energy agenda was Burgum, who pledged at campaign events that the president would halt “the hostile attack on American energy,” The Washington Post reported.

As early as February, González posted a photo of a meeting with Burgum at the White House, where they discussed “energy and permitting matters for Puerto Rico,” according to her social media post.

Meanwhile, the González administration has hired at least three lobbying firms for $1.5 million to position itself in federal discussions on Capitol Hill and at the White House about energy policy.

One of these firms is Navigators Global, through which the Puerto Rico Government has monitored the implementation of Trump’s energy agenda, according to invoices obtained by the CPI through a public records request.

In March, for example, Navigators’ lobbyists reported that they “flagged comments by Secretary of Energy Wright regarding Puerto Rico’s energy system, identifying opportunities for strategic follow-up,” while in April they closely tracked congressional discussions about vulnerabilities in the U.S. electrical grid with the goal of “elevating the urgency of modernizing Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure.”

The invoices also describe coordinated meetings with members of Congress and White House officials. Among the lawmakers most frequently mentioned is Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

Senator Lee is not a newcomer to Puerto Rico’s energy affairs. In 2019, the CPI revealed emails showing that before the Government announced its intention to privatize the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority that same year, and before LUMA Energy arrived in 2021, Lee had quietly promoted, through communications with the Fiscal Control Board, a proposal to privatize the public corporation through federal legislation.

At least since last March, the González administration’s lobbyists have sought to establish a direct line to Lee’s office.

The March invoice submitted by Navigators notes that the firm coordinated with Spencer Stokes, a Utah lobbyist who served as Lee’s chief of staff more than 12 years ago, “to ensure continued follow-up and scheduling of a meeting between Chairman Lee and Governor Gonzalez.”

In April, Navigators reported coordinating a meeting between Puerto Rico’s Federal Affairs Administration and a staff member in Lee’s office “who agreed to assess the possibility of a congressional delegation visit to Puerto Rico focused on energy resiliency.” The lobbyists then followed up “to confirm interest in scheduling a direct meeting with Governor González-Colón and to coordinate staff-level engagement on upcoming territorial hearings.”

Another meeting arranged by Navigators on energy issues involved Wendy Baig, the director of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and an adviser to Sen. Lee, to “explore legislative avenues related to Puerto Rico’s energy resiliency and infrastructure modernization.”

Governor’s double message on renewable energy

During her appearance in Montana, González said the Biden administration used Puerto Rico, and the nearly $18 billion in federal funds she claims to have secured for the electric grid while she was Resident Commissioner, as a “laboratory” for renewable energy.

She noted that she is still waiting for the delivery of storage batteries that the Government purchased from Tesla for $750 million, suggesting that they are not a short-term solution. She also said her administration used $365 million in federal funds allocated to a solar energy program to carry out repairs at power plants that would add 400 megawatts of capacity.

“In the last four years, it was Washington dictating what the island needs. And what happened [is] they decided to have Puerto Rico as a laboratory for renewable, solar panels, batteries. And I don’t have anything against that. But you cannot run an island, businesses, manufacturing and hospitals, 24/7 with batteries,” González said.

However, Puerto Rico is home to manufacturers such as Eaton and Medtronic and pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Eli Lilly, whose plants are partially powered by solar and battery systems, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Two weeks later, at the Solar and Energy Storage Association (SESA) conference in San Juan, the Governor struck a different tone when talking about renewable energy.

“From the Tesla Megapack battery project to the accelerated approval of renewable energy under Executive Order 2025-047, we are working hand in hand with organizations like SESA to achieve our shared goal of delivering real progress for our people with a new grid operator,” read the statement La Fortaleza sent to the press.

The Governor’s shifting rhetoric on energy may reflect the Trump administration’s softened stance toward renewables, according to former Popular Democratic Party Sen. Eduardo Bhatia, now a public policy professor at Princeton University, who led the 2014 energy reform as Senate president.

“The biggest challenge the Governor has faced is trying to decipher Trump’s Department of Energy,” Bhatia told the CPI.

“I think the Governor has been very careful not to cross a line,” he added.

Beyond González Colón’s statements about American energy dominance and the solar industry, her administration’s actions point in a clear direction: liquefied natural gas.

Even before taking office, González appointed Josué Colón as her “Energy Czar,” a new role with authority to oversee, coordinate, and monitor the reconstruction and modernization of the electric system, according to the announcement of his appointment. Colón began steering the system toward natural gas nearly 15 years ago, when he served as generation director at the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority during the Luis Fortuño administration. In 2021, he returned as the public corporation’s executive director, and under his leadership, PREPA handed over the operation of most of its generation fleet to Genera in 2023.

Like the Governor, the so-called Energy Czar believes natural gas should be Puerto Rico’s primary power source. Colón has argued that solar energy is not “cost-efficient” for most residents and that, to carry out González Colón’s public policy of making U.S. natural gas the island’s main energy source, Puerto Rico would need to build gas pipelines, which he describes as the “most efficient, safest, and most cost-effective” way to transport the fuel.

“And the public needs to understand that,” he said in June during a luncheon hosted by the United Retailers Association (CUD, in Spanish).

Hours later, at a press conference where the Energy Czar was also present, the Governor denied that her administration had any plans to build gas pipelines.

For Bhatia, the issue represents “a major political problem,” considering that Puerto Rico has no political or social appetite for such projects.

The first bill González submitted to the Legislature as governor — and the first to become law — eliminated the intermediate benchmarks established under Energy Public Policy Law Act 14, which mandates that 100% of Puerto Rico’s energy come from renewable sources by or before 2050. According to her, this action opened the door to using liquefied natural gas as a “transition” fuel, even though LNG had already been part of the island’s energy policy since 2014.

“What she did amend [from the energy reform] was the use of coal. That was supposed to end by 2027, and she pushed it [to 2032],” Bhatia said, referring to the AES coal plant.

When the Montana event opened to audience questions, there was only one, from a man who said he had friends in Puerto Rico “because it’s a tax haven,” who asked: “Why doesn’t Puerto Rico build a port for natural gas traffic? Has it considered that?”

“Of course. And that’s what we all want. And we’re on the same page. I was criticized during the campaign because I was the only one calling about using American LNG. How are we the main [LNG] provider for many countries and we cannot do that in our territory?” the Governor replied, referring to the possibility of increasing Puerto Rico’s consumption of U.S.-produced liquefied natural gas.

“I’m looking for two things: switching from 62% petroleum to LNG. And the second one is literally changing the operator of the transmission system [LUMA],” she said.",https://newsismybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Montana-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 09:59:13.937351

Deaths have topped 1,200 across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, with more than 800 still missing in floods and landslides. In Indonesia, entire villages remain cut off after bridges and roads were swept away. Thousands in Sri Lanka lack clean water, while Thailand’s prime minister acknowledged shortcomings in his government’s response.

Malaysia is still reeling from one its worst floods, which killed three and displaced thousands. Meanwhile, Vietnam and the Philippines have faced a year of punishing storms and floods that have left hundreds dead.

What feels unprecedented is exactly what climate scientists expect: A new normal of punishing storms, floods and devastation.

“Southeast Asia should brace for a likely continuation and potential worsening of extreme weather in 2026 and for many years immediately following that,” said Jemilah Mahmood, who leads the think tank Sunway Centre for Planetary Health in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Asia is facing the full force of the climate crisis

Climate patterns last year helped set the stage for 2025’s extreme weather.

Atmospheric levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide jumped by the most on record in 2024. That “turbocharged” the climate, the United Nation’s World Meteorological Organization says, resulting in more extreme weather.

Asia is bearing the brunt of such changes, warming nearly twice as fast as the global average. Scientists agree that the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are increasing.

Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for storms, making them stronger and wetter, while rising sea levels amplify storm surges, said Benjamin Horton, a professor of earth science at the City University of Hong Kong.

Storms are arriving later in the year, one after another as climate change affects air and ocean currents, including systems like El Nino, which keeps ocean waters warmer for longer and extends the typhoon season. With more moisture in the air and changes in wind patterns, storms can form quickly.

“While the total number of storms may not dramatically increase, their severity and unpredictability will,” Horton said.

Governments were unprepared

The unpredictability, intensity, and frequency of recent extreme weather events are overwhelming Southeast Asian governments, said Aslam Perwaiz of the Bangkok-based intergovernmental Asian Disaster Preparedness Center. He attributes that to a tendency to focus on responding to disasters rather than preparing for them.

“Future disasters will give us even less lead time to prepare,” Perwaiz warned.

In Sri Lanka’s hardest-hit provinces, little has changed since 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, said Sarala Emmanuel, a human-rights researcher in Batticaloa. It killed 230,000 people.

“When a disaster like this happens, the poor and marginalized communities are the worst affected,” Emmanuel said. That includes poor tea plantation workers living in areas prone to landslides.

Unregulated development that damages local ecosystems has worsened flood damage, said Sandun Thudugala of the Colombo-based non-profit Law and Society Trust. Sri Lanka needs to rethink how it builds and plans, he said, taking into account a future where extreme weather is the norm.

Videos of logs swept downstream in Indonesia suggested deforestation may have made the floods worse. Since 2000, the flood-inundated Indonesian provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have lost 19,600 square kilometers (7,569 square miles) of forest, an area larger than the state of New Jersey, according to Global Forest Watch.

Officials rejected claims of illegal logging, saying the timber looked old and probably came from landholders.

Billions are lost, while climate finance is limited

Countries are losing billions of dollars a year because of climate change.

Vietnam estimates that it lost over $3 billion in the first 11 months of this year because of floods, landslides and storms.

Thailand’s government data is fragmented, but its agriculture ministry estimates about $47 million in agricultural losses since August. The Kasikorn Research Center estimates the November floods in southern Thailand alone caused about $781 million in losses, potentially shaving off 0.1% of GDP.

Indonesia doesn’t have data for losses for this year but its annual average losses from natural disasters are $1.37 billion, its finance ministry says.

Costs from disasters are an added burden for Sri Lanka, which contributes a tiny fraction of global carbon emissions but is at the frontline of climate impacts, while it spends most of its wealth to repay foreign loans, said Thudugala.

“There is also an urgent need for vulnerable countries like ours to get compensated for loss and damages we suffer because of global warming,” Thudugala said.

“My request … is support to recover some of the losses we have suffered,” said Rohan Wickramarachchi, owner of a commercial building in the central Sri Lankan town of Peradeniya that was flooded to its second floor. He and dozens of other families he knows must now start over.

Responding to increasingly desperate calls for help, at the COP30 global climate conference last month in Brazil, countries pledged to triple funding for climate adaptation and make $1.3 trillion in annual climate financing available by 2035. That’s still woefully short of what developing nations requested, and it’s unclear if those funds will actually materialize.

Southeast Asia is at a crossroads for climate action, said Thomas Houlie of the science and policy institute, Climate Analytics. The region is expanding use of renewable energy but still reliant on fossil fuels.

“What we’re seeing in the region is dramatic and it’s unfortunately a stark reminder of the consequences of the climate crisis,” Houlie said.

Colorado and the nation face increasing energy demands and critical mineral supply needs. These pressures are amplified by population growth, energy-intensive artificial intelligence, a shrinking energy supply portfolio, and geopolitical challenges that have fundamentally altered historical supply chains. In Colorado specifically, approximately a quarter of our electric energy is supplied by coal.

However, public policy decisions will result in this supply largely going offline during the next five years as a result of premature coal fleet retirements. The already significant gap left by these retirements has been made even more challenging by the rise of AI technology expected to increase energy consumption by 6.7% to 12% by 2028, according to a Department of Energy report. At the same time, critical minerals supply chains for advanced technologies used in defense applications, renewable energy and electric-vehicle batteries have become constrained by China, which has a near 90% monopoly on the critical minerals market.

It’s becoming increasingly apparent our energy portfolio must include carbon-free nuclear energy, and our minerals supplies must be sourced domestically with the highest environmental standards, rather than from unreliable adversarial nations with little to no environmental protections. In 2024, federal legislation was enacted banning the import of Russian Uranium and the current administration took decisive action issuing executive orders earlier this year to better coordinate the review process for domestic minerals projects. The U.S. Geological Survey also designated uranium as a critical mineral, and in May of last year Coloradans of both parties came together to enact legislation defining nuclear energy as a clean-energy source for municipal financing purposes and to count toward Colorado’s statutory carbon emissions reduction goals.

Colorado is well positioned to play a leading role in sustainably sourced critical minerals production and has some of the nation’s richest reserves of uranium, the supply source for nuclear energy, and vanadium used in high-strength alloys. However, our ability to meet these supply needs is directly challenged by new county regulatory proposals that would conflict with existing requirements already administered by the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (DRMS), the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Specifically, San Miguel County on Colorado’s western slope has been promoting a regulatory framework to establish the nation’s first county-level comprehensive mining and reclamation program.

This is problematic for a number of reasons, beginning with the fact under Colorado Law, DRMS has the exclusive authority to regulate mining and reclamation in the state. Similarly, Bureau of Land Management regulates mining operations on Federal Public Lands, and the DOE administers specific uranium leases under its authority. These regulatory entities have decades of experience and highly qualified staff to ensure Colorado’s mining and reclamation operations are among the safest and most environmentally sound anywhere in the world.

San Miguel County’s “purposely duplicative” proposal would complicate program administration, allow for a county-level veto of state and federally granted permits, and interfere with vested mineral rights, all without any added measure of environmental protection. Instead, the county proposal would drive away investment in sustainably sourced minerals and eliminate good paying jobs in the county’s west end, which widely supports new mining operations. A recent report by the Common Sense Institute found up to 170 permanent, good-paying jobs could be generated in the near future as a result of new mining activity in the area. Finalizing the county’s proposal would severely jeopardize this potential economic activity in rural Colorado communities.

The Colorado Mining Association has engaged with the county for almost a year in five Board of County Commissioners hearings and submitted detailed comments regarding industry concerns and how to address them. Most recently, CMA urged the county to work collaboratively with DRMS, BLM and DOE to make full use of the wide range of communication and coordination tools already available to ensure county concerns are heard and addressed in state and federal permits. DRMS, BLM and DOE have signaled their willingness to work with the county in this effort, rather than see the county move forward with a program inconsistent with state and federal law.

Dec 2 (Reuters) – The U.S. Department of Energy said on Tuesday it will provide up to $800 million to support development of small modular reactors by the Tennessee Valley Authority and private company Holtec.

The Trump administration and nuclear companies believe SMRs will help supply electricity to the U.S. where power demand is rising for the first time in two decades on artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency mining and electric vehicles.

Backers say SMRs could save costs because they are expected to be built in factories. But no such reactors are under construction in the United States and questions exist about whether they can provide power as cheaply as today’s larger reactors. Nuclear power also creates long-lasting radioactive waste for which there is no permanent repository.

TVA, a U.S.-owned power utility, will receive up to $400 million in federal cost-shared funding for development of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River site in Tennessee and other projects, the Energy Department said.

Holtec, which will also receive up to $400 million, plans to build two SMRs at its Palisades, Michigan, site. Holtec is hoping to reopen the 800-megawatt Palisades conventional reactor this year, which shut in 2022 after operating for more than 50 years.

The plant secured a $1.52 billion loan guarantee during former President Joe Biden’s administration, and so far the Energy Department’s loan office has disbursed more than $490 million of the financing.

The Energy Department expects the SMRs to be developed by the early 2030s. “These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.

Tesla has long established itself as the leader in self-driving technology, especially in the United States. Although there are formidable competitors, Tesla’s FSD suite is the most robust and is not limited to certain areas or roadways. It operates anywhere and everywhere.

The company’s current position as the leader in self-driving tech is being ignored by legacy automakers, a parallel to what Tesla’s position was with EV development over a decade ago, which was also ignored by competitors.

The reluctance mirrors how legacy automakers initially dismissed EVs, only to scramble in catch-up mode years later–a pattern that highlights their historical underestimation of disruptive innovations from Tesla.

Elon Musk’s Self-Driving Licensing Attempts

Musk and Tesla have tried to push Full Self-Driving to other car companies, with no true suitors, despite ongoing conversations for years. Tesla’s FSD is aiming to become more robust through comprehensive data collection and a larger fleet, something the company has tried to establish through a subscription program, free trials, and other strategies.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sends rivals dire warning about Full Self-Driving

However, competing companies have not wanted to license FSD for a handful of speculative reasons: competitive pride, regulatory concerns, high costs, or preference for in-house development.

Déjà vu All Over Again

Tesla tried to portray the importance of EVs long ago, as in the 2010s, executives from companies like Ford and GM downplayed the importance of sustainable powertrains as niche or unprofitable.

Musk once said in a 2014 interview that rivals woke up to electric powertrains when the Model S started to disrupt things and gained some market share. Things got really serious upon the launch of the Model 3 in 2017, as a mass-market vehicle was what Tesla was missing from its lineup.

This caused legacy companies to truly wake up; they were losing market share to Tesla’s new and exciting tech that offered less maintenance, a fresh take on passenger auto, and other advantages. They were late to the party, and although they have all launched vehicles of their own, they still lag in two major areas: sales and infrastructure, leaning on Tesla for the latter.

Musk’s past warnings have been plentiful. In 2017, he responded to critics who stated Tesla was chasing subsidies. He responded, “Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 and then crushed them in a junkyard,” adding that “they would be doing nothing” on EVs without Tesla’s efforts.

Companies laughed off Tesla’s prowess with EVs, only to realize they had made a grave mistake later on.

It looks to be happening once again.

A Pattern of Underestimation

Both EVs and self-driving tech represent major paradigm shifts that legacy players view as threats to their established business models; it’s hard to change. However, these early push-aways from new tech only result in reactive strategies later on, usually resulting in what pains they are facing now.

Ford is scaling back its EV efforts, and GM’s projects are hurting. Although they both have in-house self-driving projects, they are falling well behind the progress of Tesla and even other competitors.

It is getting to a point where short-term risk will become a long-term setback, and they may have to rely on a company to pull them out of a tough situation later on, just as it did with Tesla and EV charging infrastructure.

Tesla has continued to innovate, while legacy automakers have lagged behind, and it has cost them dearly.

Implications and Future Outlook

Moving forward, Tesla’s progress will continue to accelerate, while a dismissive attitude by other companies will continue to penalize them, especially as time goes on. Falling further behind in self-driving could eventually lead to market share erosion, as autonomy could be a crucial part of vehicle marketing within the next few years.

Eventually, companies could be forced into joint partnerships as economic pressures mount. Some companies did this with EVs, but it has not resulted in very much.

Self-driving efforts are not only a strength for companies themselves, but they also contribute to other things, like affordability and safety.

Tesla has exhibited data that specifically shows its self-driving tech is safer than human drivers, most recently by a considerable margin. This would help with eliminating accidents and making roads safer.

Tesla’s new Safety Report shows Autopilot is nine times safer than humans

Additionally, competition in the market is a good thing, as it drives costs down and helps innovation continue on an upward trend.

Conclusion

The parallels are unmistakable: a decade ago, legacy automakers laughed off electric vehicles as toys for tree-huggers, crushed their own EV programs, and bet everything on the internal-combustion status quo–only to watch Tesla redefine the industry while they scrambled for billions in catch-up capital.

Today, the same companies are turning down repeated offers to license Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology, insisting they can build better autonomy in-house, even as their own programs stumble through recalls, layoffs, and missed milestones. History is not merely rhyming; it is repeating almost note-for-note.

Elon Musk has spent twenty years warning that the auto industry’s bureaucratic inertia and short-term thinking will leave it stranded on the wrong side of technological revolutions. The question is no longer whether Tesla is ahead–it is whether the giants of Detroit, Stuttgart, and Toyota will finally listen before the next wave leaves them watching another leader pull away in the rear-view mirror.

This time, the stakes are not just market share; they are the very definition of what a car will be in the decades ahead.

Elon Musk stated that rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could make traditional work unnecessary within two decades.

Speaking on entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath’s podcast, Musk predicted that machines will soon handle most forms of labor, leaving humans to work only if they choose to.

Work as a “hobby”

During the discussion, Musk said the accelerating capability of AI systems and general-purpose robots will eventually cover all essential tasks, making human labor a choice rather than an economic requirement. “In less than 20 years, working will be optional. Working at all will be optional. Like a hobby,” Musk said.

When Kamath asked whether this future is driven by massive productivity growth, Musk agreed, noting that people will still be free to work if they enjoy the routine or the challenge. He compared future employment to home gardening, as it is something people can still do for personal satisfaction even if buying food from a store is far easier.

“Optional” work in the future

Elon Musk acknowledged the boldness of his claim and joked that people might look back in 20 years and say he was wrong. That being said, the CEO noted that such a scenario could even happen sooner than his prediction, at least if one were to consider the pace of the advancements in AI and robotics.

“Obviously people can play this back in 20 years and say, ‘Look, Elon made this ridiculous prediction and it’s not true,’ but I think it will turn out to be true, that in less than 20 years, maybe even as little as ten or 15 years, the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional,” Musk said.

Elon Musk’s comments echo his previous sentiments at Tesla’s 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting, where he noted that Optimus could ultimately eliminate poverty. He also noted that robots like Optimus could eventually provide people worldwide with the best medical care.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tesla-fsd-v14-1-7-test-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 02:59:21.526119

As a matter of course, federal agencies make and implement regulatory policies with stakes for state, local, and tribal governments.

Agency consultation with state and local governments is broadly based on federalism values. The federal government’s obligation to consult with the governments of Indian tribes is grounded both in the unique government-to-government relationship between tribes and the United States and in the Indian trust responsibility, which requires the federal government to support tribal nations, including through Congress’s longstanding policy of promoting tribal self-government and economic development. As early as 1970, for example, President Richard Nixon sent a special message to Congress calling upon the federal government to “act on the basis of what the Indians have long been telling us.” Intergovernmental consultation may improve regulatory policymaking, strengthen relationships between governments, and recognize that those who are most affected should be involved in policymaking that will affect them.

For these reasons, many federal statutes, including the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, a federal statute that aims to identify and limit federal legislation that would impose unfunded mandates on state and local governments, and longstanding executive orders—including those on federalism, tribal consultation, and regulatory planning and review—direct agencies to consult when their policies have implications for state, local, and tribal governments. Although these statutes and executive orders have been on the books for decades, and many agencies have attempted to implement them, intergovernmental consultation too often becomes a “box-checking” exercise that does not improve policy or embody respect for state, local, and tribal governments or their constituencies.

The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) engaged us to study the legal frameworks and best practices for consultation among federal agencies and state, local, and tribal governments. ACUS’s prior recommendations on public engagement recognized the value of intergovernmental consultation but did not address the unique legal, political, and practical questions involved in this process.

We set out to understand what federal agencies are actually doing when consulting with other governments. This meant looking at agencies’ consultation policies—when they existed. It also required examining what agencies actually do when making, implementing, and consulting about regulatory policies. To these ends, we analyzed more than 20 published consultation policies and over 100 recent comments on agency consultation from the Federal Register and interviewed experts with experience in intergovernmental consultation, including representatives of federal, state, tribal, and local governments. We also took a close look at public statements on consultation from representative national organizations, such as the National Congress of American Indians, and compared our findings with those of other studies, including studies by the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service. Prior work, we found, identified an overriding worry: that agencies approach consultation as a “box-checking” exercise and lack effective policies and structures to implement the executive orders requiring consultation.

One of our main findings was that agencies have developed formal policies to implement Executive Order 13,175, directing consultation with tribal governments, but not to implement Executive Order 13,132, directing consultation with state and local governments. Both the Obama Administration and the Biden Administration directed agencies to adopt tribal consultation policies and plans to implement Executive Order 13,175. Our analysis of 21 sample policies revealed important similarities and differences with respect to the definition of “tribal consultation,” the criteria for whether—and, if so, when—tribal consultation should occur, the process for consulting with tribal governments, the rules for handling and keeping confidential information shared during consultations, and the institutional structure within the agency that delegates responsibility for implementing the consultation policy. The most obvious differences stood between the policies of executive and independent agencies, as well as between policies primarily addressing informal rulemaking and formal adjudication.

We further found that federal agencies do not generally have publicly accessible, comprehensive policies and implementation plans for state and local consultation—a surprising result because Executive Order 13,132 directs agencies to develop such policies, and agencies have been comparatively diligent in developing policies for tribal consultation. We learned, however, that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does in fact have a robust formal policy for such consultation and that the agency developed this policy through an iterative, strategic, and intentional process led by key agency personnel.

Moving beyond formal policies, we identified recurring concerns about agency consultation among tribal, state, and local governments. For example, the National Congress of American Indians’ 2009 background paper on tribal consultation found that Executive Order 13,175 “is viewed by federal agencies as merely a procedural requirement” and that federal agencies “ignore or refuse to carry out their responsibilities” to consult. Our study found that the most common concern about tribal consultation was agencies’ failures to consult when the law or executive policy required it. For example, Executive Order 13,175 requires agencies to consult when a proposed regulation has “tribal implications,” but a concern frequently raised in comments and in our interviews was that agencies often missed obvious and important tribal implications.

Commenters and interviewees also stressed that for consultation to be meaningful, it must occur before agencies decide upon a course of action. Executive Order 13,175 requires agencies to consult “with tribal officials early in the process of developing the proposed regulation.” But we found that federal officials are increasingly aware that meaningful dialogue is not possible when federal agencies do not devote sufficient resources to consultation and do not send high-level officials with decision-making authority to a consultation meeting.

The same concerns arose in connection with state and local consultation. Despite the explicit requirement in Executive Order 13,132, we found little evidence in our interviews and review of documents that such consultation reliably took place. This does not mean that engagement between agencies and state and local governments, whether individually or through associations that represent such governments, never happened. Nonetheless, we found these interactions were episodic and, as with tribal consultation, often came too late to meaningfully influence the outcome of rulemaking and implementation.

Stakeholders in state and local governments and from relevant organizations who represent state and local governments recounted a rather desultory approach to consultation. They urge the federal government to improve the process of consultation, in the hopes of improving regulatory performance and fostering the federalism values undergirding important regulatory statutes and executive orders. Our study suggested that both agencies and the White House, through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget, should undertake reforms to improve consultation with state and local governments.

Based on our research, ACUS adopted Recommendation 2025-02. The recommendation suggests best practices for consultation, focusing on what agencies themselves can do to improve their engagement with tribal governments and state and local governments. These recommendations include designating a federalism consultation official and a tribal consultation official with responsibility for coordinating consultations with appropriate agencies, adopting comprehensive and distinct policies on tribal, state, and local government consultation, and developing publicly available consultation webpages with easy access to the agency’s consultation policy, contact information for consultation officials, and information on consultation activities.

ACUS’s recommendation, if implemented, would increase the transparency of a process that is too often opaque and incomplete from the vantage point of tribal, state, and local governments and constituents. Implementation would not only improve the performance of agencies but also support the unique nation-to-nation relationship between the federal governments and tribes and the unique regulatory federalism in the United States.

And when you look at the economics and the finances in the long term, it’s pretty obvious that the answer is clean energy generation.”","Environmental advocates who have been years urging state lawmakers to codify ambitious clean energy targets are making a final push to get the bill passed during this lame duck legislative session.

The New Jersey Sierra Club, the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and other clean energy supporters rallied outside the State House on Monday morning in support of a bill to require the state to get 100% of its electricity from clean sources like solar, wind and nuclear by 2035. Such a transition has been touted for years as critical to slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and creating new jobs. But as the affordability crisis intensifies in New Jersey, advocates are pushing clean energy as key to keeping utility bills low in coming years.

“New Jersey, as well as many states across the region, are currently experiencing incredibly high electric bills,” Anjuli Ramos-Busot, the state director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, told NJ Spotlight News. “There has been a boost for demand of electricity across New Jersey, and our electricity bills have skyrocketed.”

Skeptics have argued that the upfront costs of building out clean energy infrastructure makes it more appealing to instead invest in more fossil fuel development, like natural gas power plants. But Ramos-Busot says those gas plants can still take years to bring online, and are more expensive to operate as time goes on.

“Truly clean energy is the way that we can save money. Clean energy, opposite to what you’ve heard from opponents, have actually reached price neutrality. So basically it is now cheaper to generate clean energy with solar, with battery sorage, with offshore wind than it is to build a natural gas power plant.”

Gov. Phil Murphy used an executive order to set a goal for New Jersey to reach 100% clean energy by 2035, and his administration has pushed for clean energy investment over the past eight years. State energy master plans released under Murphy have been written with this target in mind. Ramos-Busot said the onus is now on lawmakers in Trenton to support that effort beyond the Murphy administration.

“They need to decide how is New Jersey going to generate this electricity. Are we going to continue to move into the trajectory of the status quo, which is natural gas and even coal power generation? Or are we going to go with the cheaper, faster, cleaner and healthier version, which is clean energy generation?” Ramos-Busot said. “This is a long-term game.

However, it also underlined the geopolitical, investment, regulatory and innovation challenges APAC needs to master to both secure its energy security and successfully navigate decarbonization.

Asia Pacific in the global race to net-zero

Southeast Asia alone is projected to drive a quarter of global energy growth by 2035(link is external), fueled by economic and population growth, and expansion in manufacturing, cloud computing and AI.

Many countries are making significant investments in renewable energies in response. In Southeast Asia, clean energy is set to meet more than 35% of demand growth to 2035, driven by a rapid expansion of solar PV and wind.

As it does, gas will also have a key role, according to Takehiko Kikuchi, Chief Regional Officer, Asia Pacific & India, at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. “Gas will be an important bridge in Asia’s energy transition as it provides reliable and affordable low-carbon power by helping to cut emissions in comparison to coal and keeping the grid stable when renewable energy is not available,” he explained.

“MHI is supporting this transition with efficient gas turbine technology, and our GTCC systems offer the highest thermal efficiency available today. Replacing a coal-fired power plant with a GTCC power plant can reduce CO2 emissions by about 65%.”

Natural gas and APAC’s energy transition

There is a growing understanding of the continued role of natural gas as a transition fuel and a pragmatic solution to skyrocketing demand. Several countries are already boosting production levels to position(link is external) themselves as regional natural gas hubs.

“We’re looking at a realistic energy transition(link is external) these days. A couple of years ago, thermal power generation was essentially seen as decreasing relative to all the renewables coming in. We're now realizing that that's not really the case. Renewables and gas are truly very complementary and can support each other to become an affordable and sustainable energy mix,” Takao Tsukui, President and CEO, Mitsubishi Power, a power solutions brand of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), told CNBC.

Natural gas will balance out the intermittency of renewable output, Kikuchi added. Given that Asia Pacific is the world’s largest logistics market(link is external), he also stressed the growing importance of LNG bunkering and of bio-methane, a low-carbon drop-in fuel for the shipping industry.

Alongside gas, countries in APAC are looking to nuclear as another option for reliable power, including in Southeast Asia, which currently has no operational nuclear capacity. There is ""renewed interest in the technology(link is external) across the region, according to analyst Wood Mackenzie.

Japan is set to become the regional leader thanks to early investments and cross-border collaboration agreements with Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia on transport and storage(link is external).

A seat at the table for low-carbon fuels

Along with CCUS, green fuels and feedstocks including hydrogen and ammonia are slated as major contributors to decarbonization.

Mitsubishi Power has conducted a series of successful tests using a mix of natural gas and hydrogen as fuel for power generation. At Mitsubishi Power’s validation facility at Takasago Hydrogen Park, tests with 100% hydrogen firing are also being conducted. Mitsubishi Power’s Tsukui told CNBC, “For now, all investments in data centers are expected to be 100% natural gas. But in the future, that’s convertible to hydrogen. When the time comes and the supply chain is ready, data centers will be using hydrogen-fired gas turbines.”

MHI’s Kikuchi expects clean hydrogen to be mainly locally produced and consumed, due to the difficulties of storing and transporting hydrogen. Even so, APAC needs to focus on building out its regional infrastructure for clean hydrogen(link is external). Countries like Australia are positioning themselves as future hubs for producing both green hydrogen and ammonia, a derivative.

Ammonia is mainly used in the production of fertilizers today. However, it can also serve as a fuel in its own right — for example in shipping — or as a carrier for hydrogen, simplifying its storage and transport from where it is produced to where in the region it’s needed.

Strengthening regional collaboration

APAC needs to play its cards right to maximize the opportunities the energy transition offers. The biggest challenge will be bringing a very diverse region closer together, strengthening collaboration and regional integration.

“No single company or country can tackle the energy trilemma alone. Truly sustainable solutions require a shared commitment to invest in growth, adopt new technologies and make the right decisions to move forward,” said Mitsubishi Power’s Tsukui at SIEW(link is external).

EPA’s grant of primacy gives the RRC authority over permitting, implementation and enforcement of the Class VI injection well program. In practice – starting with the rule’s effective date on Dec. 15, 2025 – this decision shifts the day-to-day regulatory control of the program in Texas to the RRC, while EPA maintains an oversight and review role.

Previously, Texas projects required permits from both EPA and the RRC. With the grant of primacy, the RRC becomes the primary point of contact for permit applications, technical review, monitoring and testing requirements, corrective-action plans, financial responsibility demonstrations and post-injection care. New applicants may submit directly to the RRC.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects and Class VI well developments are expected to expand rapidly in Texas. The RRC announced that it has received 18 applications1 and is aware of additional projects that are planned by the industry. Additionally, applications for Texas projects that are currently being processed by EPA will be transferred to the RRC, in line with agreements between EPA and RRC regarding transition of the program.

The Seattle-area company has not publicly offered an explanation for the downsizing or said how many workers were impacted. In a recent email to business partners, officials referenced recent funding changes and said it was undergoing a “broader restructuring effort.”

Modern Hydrogen raised $125 million since launching a decade ago. It developed a device for cracking natural gas molecules, producing hydrogen as a climate friendly fuel and a material known as solid carbon that has a variety of industrial uses, including as a key ingredient in asphalt.

Gates explored that application during a visit to Modern Hydrogen last year. The Microsoft co-founder grabbed a wheelbarrow and shovel to fill a parking lot pothole with the carbon-trapping asphalt.

The layoffs hit as the company was preparing to finish its first commercial unit for a customer in Texas and had performed two successful pilot projects with utilities in Portland, Ore., and Miami.

In January, Modern Hydrogen announced a memorandum of understanding with Puget Sound Energy, a major Seattle-area utility, to collaborate in identifying industrial customers interested in the clean hydrogen technology. That was expected to include steel and cement makers and pulp-and-paper manufacturers that use processes requiring ultra-high temperatures that could be met by hydrogen.

Given that the company had seemingly solved the new technology’s technical hurdles and was building commercial momentum, employees and business partners were surprised by the layoffs.

“A lot of folks were rooting for us,” Michael Jung, Modern Hydrogen’s former government affairs and public policy lead, told GeekWire. “I think we would have solved some key problems in the energy transition.”

On Oct. 30, Amir Moftakhar, Modern Hydrogen’s chief financial officer, sent an email to some of its subcontractors and vendors disclosing the change of course.

“We wanted to inform you that, due to recent changes in our funding situation and a significant reduction in company operations, we must terminate our engagement with you effective 10/30/2025,” stated the email, which was shared with GeekWire by one of its recipients.

“This decision is part of a broader restructuring effort which is being developed and does not reflect on your work,” Moftakhar continued. “We want to sincerely thank you for the professionalism, dedication, and quality you’ve shown throughout our collaboration and for your understanding.”

It is unclear if the company is closing entirely, what will happen with the machinery and technology, and if some component of the effort will continue in a different form.

GeekWire reached out to Modern Hydrogen CEO Tony Pan for an official comment and will update the story if he responds. We contacted a Gates’ representative for a comment as well.

One subcontractor, who asked not to be named, said that until the email went out, “things were cooking along” in their collaboration with Modern Hydrogen. Now the company is anxious about if and when it will get paid for outstanding invoices that total tens of thousands of dollars.

Modern Hydrogen got its start in 2015 at Intellectual Ventures, an innovation hub created by former Microsoft researcher Nathan Myhrvold with backing from Gates. The startup, which was originally called Modern Electron, initially focused on devices that paired with home furnaces and hot water tanks to capture the appliances’ wasted heat and turn it into electricity.

In 2023 it pivoted to focus on hydrogen and changed its name. The company’s most recent round was $25 million raised a year ago. It had approximately 80 employees at the time, according to an analysis of LinkedIn data. Modern Hydrogen co-founder and former CTO Max Mankin left the company in January.

Gates has in the past been an enthusiastic supporter of hydrogen fuel. In June 2022, he posted a Gates Notes touting the so-called “Swiss Army knife” of clean energy given its versatile applications. He was a prominent investor in the company, whose other backers included NextEra Energy, one of the world’s largest utilities; Miura; National Grid Partners; IRONGREY; Starlight Ventures; Valo Ventures and Metaplanet.

Hydrogen saw a surge of interest during the Biden administration, which created hydrogen hubs around the U.S. to bolster the technology. That funding and support has been largely curtailed under the Trump administration.

And on Oct. 28, Gates posted a memo on his personal blog that dampened his earlier excitement around climate efforts.

“Although climate change will have serious consequences — particularly for people in the poorest countries — it will not lead to humanity’s demise,” Gates wrote. “People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Modern-Hydrogen-H2-production-unit-at-NW-Natural-1-1260x945.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 00:57:46.587199

Insurance is the climate crisis’s canary in the coal mine. Climate change, due to increasing greenhouse-gas emissions, is causing more extreme and severe natural catastrophes. Insurers respond to the substantial increase in property-insurance losses caused by these disasters by increasing prices and not writing or renewing insurance. State efforts to address the problem through deregulation of the insurance market, like Florida, or by allowing substantial rate increases, like California, do not address the underlying driver of the insurance crisis. There are several measures that can help keep insurance available and affordable in the short to medium term. Insurer-focused policies include ending insurers’ financial support for the fossil-fuel industry, encouraging subrogation lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies, and requiring insurers to account for mitigation measures in pricing and underwriting. Land-use policy measures, like curbing development in high-risk areas while promoting building and development practices that reduce the risk of loss, will also help. Other state-level measures include strengthening the financial stability of residual markets through bond financing. There is also a need for federal involvement. Congress should enact a federal reinsurance program for state residual markets and a subsidy program for low-income households to afford residual-market premiums. But the risk of loss from climate-driven events keeps climbing and will eventually overwhelm the benefits of these additional policies. The only long-term solution to preserve an insurable future is to transition from fossil fuels and other greenhouse-gas-emitting industries.

Introduction

The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 killed at least thirty-one people and destroyed over 16,000 structures. Estimates put the economic losses from this horrific event as high as $250 billion. Insurance companies are expected to pay $40 billion in claims—the largest insured loss from a wildfire anywhere, ever. Facing over $4 billion in claims, California’s insurer of last resort—the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan—needed a $1 billion bailout, more than half of which will land on all California insurance policyholders as a result of a recent state policy change. Research indicates that climate change made this disaster 35% more likely to occur—two years of above-average precipitation caused rapid brush growth, followed by an abnormally dry year that converted the brush into kindling awaiting ignition.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural-catastrophe events, which, in turn, damage and destroy homes and businesses at an unprecedented scale. In the last ten years, climate change accounted for over 30% of insured natural-catastrophe losses incurred across the globe. Global insurance losses from natural catastrophes keep climbing. In response to rising losses, property-insurance companies have significantly raised their rates and are increasingly refusing to write or renew insurance for homes and businesses, creating an insurance crisis.

Insurance is the climate crisis’s “canary in the coal mine.” And the canary is dying. In an effort to keep insurance available and affordable for a while longer, this Essay will analyze recent policy and regulatory responses to the property-insurance crisis and propose additional solutions to address their inadequacies. This Essay relies not only on research and engagement with insurance-sector participants, regulators, policymakers, and other stakeholders related to the insurance crisis, but on my own experience as the former Insurance Commissioner for the State of California, where I worked to get insurers to evaluate, consider, and address the growing risks and losses associated with the global climate crisis.

Part I provides background on the property-insurance industry and describes the nature and scope of the growing insurance crisis, including its implications for homeownership and the U.S. economy going forward. It will then delve into the examples of California and Florida, which have responded differently to the insurance crisis. California has maintained its regulation of rates and insurers but has recently embraced some deregulatory measures. Under these measures, insurers can use probabilistic models to justify rate increases and incorporate reinsurance costs into rates, so long as they promise to write more insurance in high-risk areas. Florida, by contrast, has long declined to regulate rates and has recently embraced even more deregulation of its insurance market.

While both approaches might enjoy moderate short- and mid-run success, they will prove inadequate in addressing the insurance crisis in the long run. Florida’s blanket deregulatory approach may provide an opportunity for keeping some property insurance available (albeit, not affordable). But Florida homeowners and businesses pay four times the national average in rates. Moreover, because Florida does not require insurers to demonstrate sufficient financial strength, Floridians face the likelihood that future damage claims from a major hurricane will be unpaid.

California’s current regulatory approach will be insufficient as well. The state continues to regulate insurers’ rates and reserves, though recent regulatory changes allow substantial rate increases linked to promises to write more insurance in high-risk areas. But this approach, too, will likely be overwhelmed by the insurance losses from the growing frequency and severity of climate-driven events. Fundamentally, both approaches fail to address the greenhouse-gas emissions driving the crisis. And both states fail to require insurers to account for risk-reduction measures in their decisions to write and renew insurance.

Part II lays out state-level solutions to help keep some home and small-business property insurance available. One set of solutions focuses on state-level regulation of insurers. It includes proposals that would require insurers to recover some portion of their climate-driven natural-catastrophe losses from fossil-fuel companies and account for risk reduction associated with proven climate-adaptation and resilience measures in their decisions to write and renew insurance. Another set of state-level solutions expands the focus beyond insurers, exploring ways to discourage development in areas at high risk of climate-driven disasters through land-use policy. Part II also discusses measures that would help stabilize state-created residual markets, like requiring real-estate developers to post bonds to cover expected losses and issuing catastrophe bonds to provide an alternative means of risk transfer. Throughout the discussion of these various proposals, I will identify and respond to legal and policy-based objections.

In Part III, I discuss the need for federal intervention, in the form of both a reinsurance program for state-run residual markets and subsidies enabling low-income homeowners forced to buy insurance in residual markets to afford insurance. Part III also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of a proposal to establish a federal all-risk, all-disaster property insurance scheme and concludes that the benefits of this proposal are outweighed by the harms.

To be clear, these insurance-policy solutions, while important, are only stopgaps. Unless we transition away from fossil fuels and from other greenhouse-gas-emitting industries that continue to drive up global temperatures, we will continue to march—at an increasing pace—toward an uninsurable future.

I. marching toward an uninsurable future

Three factors contribute to the growing insurance crisis globally and in the United States. First, climate change results in more severe and more frequent weather-related disasters, which damage and destroy home and business property and contribute to record insurance-company losses. Second, these losses are compounded by the rising costs of replacing or repairing homes and businesses. Finally, the increasing construction of homes and business properties in areas prone to climate-driven natural catastrophes expands insurance losses when disaster strikes. The last two factors, however, would not matter as much if the first were not true.

In response to increased losses from these three factors, insurance companies raise rates for policyholders and refuse to renew existing insurance policies or write new ones. This generates a crisis in which insurance is more expensive and less available. States like California and Florida have taken different approaches toward addressing this climate-driven insurance crisis. These recent state measures, while likely to keep some insurance available in the short run, do not address the root cause of the insurance crisis. Insurers in these states—indeed, in all states—will be overrun by the increased risk and losses resulting from rising global temperatures.

A. A Primer on the Property-Insurance Industry

With roots going back as far as ancient Babylon, property insurance as we know it developed in the seventeenth century at Lloyd’s coffeehouse in London, as a way for owners and investors in ships and their cargo to spread shipping risks and losses. Insurance continues to serve this function today: a financial instrument that protects against risk and loss. Insurance allows an individual or business to transfer the risk of a loss to someone else—an insurance company—who agrees to shoulder the burden in exchange for a payment called a premium. An insurance company remains profitable—collecting more in premiums and returns on investments than it pays out in claims—by pricing and spreading risk and excluding or limiting coverage for losses and risks that are so high that the insurer is likely to lose money covering them. Property insurance is no exception to these fundamental principles. This Section will describe several applications of these core principles of insurance that are crucial to understanding the nature of the insurance crisis and potential solutions.

Property-insurance companies use several methods to price and underwrite risk for properties, including catastrophe models. Insurers “underwrite” the risk of loss or damage to a property by writing or renewing a property-insurance policy, usually for a year’s duration, in which the insurer agrees to cover and make payments for certain losses or damage to the property up to a coverage limit and subject to exclusions and terms set forth in the insurance policy. Catastrophe models determine the probability and potential magnitude of losses in future years by accounting for the nature, severity, and frequency of disasters, as well as their impact on, and the vulnerability of, insured property. As climate change has exacerbated natural disasters, insurers have increasingly relied not just on their recent history of losses but on future projections of losses using catastrophe models.

Insurance companies not only price risk and spread it across the pool of insureds but also transfer risk to insurers of their own. This insurance for insurance companies is called reinsurance. Direct writers of insurance purchase reinsurance from reinsurance companies, which usually operate globally, in order to transfer some of the risk they face to global capital markets. Reinsurance contracts often have attachment points that dictate the threshold of losses above which the reinsurer assumes responsibility to pay the direct writer of insurance to cover those losses. Reinsurance contracts also typically have coverage limits that cap the amount of payment from the reinsurer.

Insurers and reinsurers also transfer risk of loss to capital markets through the issuance of “insurance linked securities” like catastrophe bonds. Catastrophe bonds are a type of high-risk, high-yield investment that transfers the risk of natural disasters from insurers to capital-market investors. If a predefined catastrophic event, like a major hurricane or earthquake, does not occur during the bond’s term, investors receive their principal back plus interest payments. However, if the event occurs, the investors can lose all or part of their principal, which is then used by the insurer or reinsurer who issued the catastrophe bond to help cover claims.

When insurers pay claims, they have the right of subrogation, which exists in almost all insurance contracts and under state law. Insurers can sue third parties whose actions or inactions cause damage or injury to insurance policyholders, which in turn requires the insurance company to pay the policyholder’s claim. Subrogation enables insurers to stand in the shoes of their policyholder and bring suit against third parties to recover the insurance proceeds paid to the policyholder.

But, as risks become certainties and losses increase substantially, the business of risk transfer (that is, insurance) can become unprofitable even with higher prices. Private-property insurers begin to stop underwriting, that is, they stop renewing existing policies and issuing new insurance policies. As homeowners and small-business property owners are unable to find insurance from traditional “admitted” private insurance companies, they are forced to buy insurance from the less regulated and more expensive nonadmitted “surplus lines insurers” or from insurance “residual markets” established by state law as insurers of last resort. While admitted insurers are fully licensed and regulated by the state, surplus-lines insurers are not licensed, less regulated, and will write insurance for risks or exposures that admitted carriers decline to cover, albeit with higher premiums.

Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia have established “residual markets” to write insurance for properties that private admitted carriers refuse to write policies for. In most of these states, legislation establishes a Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan. A FAIR plan is an involuntary association of admitted property and casualty insurers, who must participate in order to obtain and maintain a license to sell insurance in the state. FAIR Plans and other residual markets are usually structured so that if there is a shortfall in reserves to pay claims, the insurance-company members of the association share in making up the shortfall through an assessment collected by the FAIR Plan or residual market from insurance companies, based on their relative market share in the state.

The implicit rationale for requiring private insurance companies to make up such shortfalls is that they are the ones determining the number of policyholders who will be forced to buy insurance through the residual market or FAIR Plan in the first place. By virtue of deciding not to renew or write insurance for certain properties, private insurers send policyholders to the residual market or FAIR Plan. States decided insurers should not be able to “cherry pick” the best risks and throw everyone else onto the FAIR Plan or other residual market, without bearing some responsibility if the FAIR Plan or other residual market runs out of money.

Florida and Louisiana are notable exceptions to the usual state-law approach requiring private insurers in the state to make up for shortfalls in FAIR Plan or residual-market reserves based on their relative market share. In these two hurricane-prone states, property-insurance policyholders in the state, including those not on the FAIR Plans, are assessed by Louisiana’s or Florida’s version of a FAIR Plan in the event their reserves are insufficient to pay claims. In other words, private insurers in those two states are not on the hook if the residual market—necessitated by private insurers’ refusal to write insurance—runs out of money. Insurance policyholders are.

B. The Crisis Facing the Insurance Industry

Climate change is not just tomorrow’s scourge; it is today’s reality. Climate change makes existing natural disasters more frequent and severe, and transforms previously mundane occurrences, like rainstorms, into destructive events. While climate-driven catastrophes vary in severity and frequency across the United States—with states like California, Florida, and Louisiana most at risk—there is virtually no place in the United States that is not experiencing worsening weather-related events. The resulting increase in losses has caused insurers to raise rates and stop renewing and writing insurance. Higher rates and less underwriting, in turn, make mortgages and other forms of credit less affordable or available because lenders require the borrower to have and maintain insurance. Obstacles to homeownership and higher rents as landlords pass insurance costs onto renters only exacerbate the nation’s housing crisis. Together, these trends set up the central challenge for policymakers: keep insurance available in the short term while facilitating the energy and economic transition to net-zero emissions necessary to preserve the long-term viability of insurance and housing markets.

There is strong expert consensus that global temperatures are on track to rise over two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, potentially by as early as 2029. Climate scientists warn about approaching “tipping points” that will accelerate changes in climate and related catastrophic events. And even if all greenhouse-gas emissions ceased today, substantial climate change has been baked into our climatic system. Already we are experiencing the impacts: more frequent and intense weather-related events, such as wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, extreme heat, river and coastal floods, and severe convective storms. These climate-driven catastrophes will kill and injure more people, damage and destroy more property, render entire geographies unlivable, undermine agricultural production, and potentially result in mass migration, to name but a few impacts.

Climate change is also expanding losses from perils that were not historically major sources of losses. Severe convective storms accounted for at least forty-one percent of insured natural-catastrophe losses in 2025. Rising global temperatures result in larger amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere, which, coupled with changing weather patterns, enable “atmospheric rivers” of water vapor to stay over a particular geography for longer periods of time. Severe convective storms characterized by heavy rain, and sometimes with hail and wind, are landing across the United States in historically unprecedented ways.

The effects of climate change are not limited to states like California, Louisiana, and Florida. Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of weather-related events throughout the United States. For example, wildfires are not limited to the West, but are also occurring in New England and the Southeast. The Gulf and Atlantic states are being hit with more intense hurricanes and wind. Severe convective storms are landing throughout the United States, including the Midwest, New England, the South, and the West, causing major losses.

Another factor that exacerbates losses is the development of new homes and businesses in areas at the highest risk of climate-driven weather-related events. For example, between 1990 and 2010, forty-three percent of all new homes were built in wildfire-prone areas, accounting for twenty-five million residents. Moreover, the increased cost of replacing homes and business property only adds to the burden on insurers. However, the presence of more homes and businesses in areas at risk and the increased costs of replacing homes and business property would not drive insurance losses as significantly without more severe and frequent climate-driven events.

The upshot of climate change coupled with unwise development choices and rising replacement costs is increased losses for insurers. Globally, insurers had over $137 billion in weather-related natural-catastrophe losses (payments to policyholders) in 2024—significantly exceeding the ten-year average of $98 billion. Losses are on track to increase to $145 billion in 2025. Swiss Re, one of the world’s largest, oldest, and most respected reinsurers, estimates a one-in-ten probability that global insured natural-catastrophe losses could reach as high as $300 billion in 2025.

The situation in the United States is consistent with these global trends. In the United States, insured natural-catastrophe losses are also at record levels, reaching $117 billion in 2024, which exceeds the rolling ten-year average by 52%. In 2024, there were twenty-seven events that resulted in over $1 billion in losses in the United States.

Insurers respond to increased losses in two principal ways. First, they increase the price of insurance. Second, they reduce their exposure to losses by not renewing insurance policies and not writing new insurance policies. U.S. insurers do both. In the last three years alone, home-insurance premiums on average rose by twenty-four percent. Across the United States, insurers are not renewing home and small-business owners’ property insurance, and they are reducing the issuance of new insurance policies.

The increased prices and decreased availability of property insurance place a heavy burden on homeowners and the economy at large. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that in areas where insurance prices are rising due to losses from climate-driven events, there is a corresponding increase in mortgage-payment delinquencies and defaults. Mortgage lenders require the borrower to maintain insurance. As insurance costs go up, the borrower’s ability to maintain mortgage and insurance payments decreases. If insurance is unaffordable or unavailable to the borrower, the lender can “force place” insurance (obtain insurance for the property and force the borrower to pay for it), which usually costs even more than traditional home insurance, leading to more defaults.

A Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis survey found that owners and operators of permanently affordable multifamily housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households are getting squeezed by insurance price increases. Affordable-housing owners and operators cannot increase rents to cover higher insurance costs, increasing the potential for defaults on loans and discouraging the development of new, permanently affordable housing. Owners and operators of market-rate rental housing are also feeling the squeeze. As they raise rents to cover increased insurance costs, rental housing becomes even more unaffordable, exacerbating the nation’s housing crisis. Increased pricing of property insurance falls hardest on low-income households, who have limited or no ability to cover increased home-insurance or rent costs.

The long-term outlook is grim. During his semiannual testimony before Congress, Federal Reserve Chairperson Jerome Powell addressed the growing issue of insurers withdrawing from regions at high risk of natural disasters. “If you fast-forward 10 or 15 years, there are going to be regions of the country where you can’t get a mortgage,” Powell said. He explained that “financial institutions and insurance providers are increasingly avoiding areas prone to wildfires, hurricanes,” and other climate-driven risks.

A recent analysis of the impact of climate change on U.S. housing markets over the next twenty-five years found that homes may decrease in value by over one trillion dollars across the country. Increased insurance costs and decreased availability of insurance will reduce the ability to obtain a mortgage and reduce demand for housing. Economic losses and physical impacts from weather-related events will negatively impact local economies, which will affect employment opportunities and people’s ability to continue living in areas hit by disasters. Climate-related migration will reduce housing demand in these geographies, which, in turn, will further drive down housing values. There is potential for a runaway effect—lower property values also squeeze local-government budgets, which rely on property taxes as their primary revenue source, thus degrading the quality of local services and reducing the ability to service or issue debt necessary to finance local public-infrastructure projects.

The dwindling availability of mortgages and affordable housing is just one example of the systemic risk that climate change poses for the financial system, through the impact of climate-driven losses on insurers. Without insurance, households and businesses cannot recover or rebuild in the wake of more climate-driven disasters. But the impact is not limited to high-risk areas. As losses mount, we can expect to see more insurance-company insolvencies, more unaffordable insurance price increases, and more insurers declining to write or renew insurance, all of which will negatively impact credit availability and asset values, which, in turn, will harm the real economy. A recent report from the U.S. Senate Budget Committee described the economic consequences of the insurance crisis as “2008 all over again,” except with more permanent results.

C. California’s Response to the Insurance Crisis

Insurers in California, as elsewhere in the United States, have responded to increased losses from climate-driven perils in typical fashion. California insurers incurred substantial wildfire-related losses in 2017 and 2018, nearly $12 billion in 2017 and over $13 billion in 2018. In response, insurers increased home-insurance prices by an average of 43.7% from 2018 through 2023. In the substantial areas of the state facing high wildfire risk, prices on average have increased far more.

Likewise, increased losses and increased risk of losses from wildfires have resulted in increased nonrenewals of home and small-business property insurance in California. In 2023, major national insurance companies announced that they would stop writing insurance policies for new customers in California. They also announced that they would increase their selective nonrenewal of homes and businesses they perceived as too risky.

One indicator of the acuity of the insurance crisis is the increase in FAIR Plan or other residual-market policyholders. Because the California FAIR Plan is an insurer of last resort, an increase in its membership indicates a lack of options in the private market. The California FAIR Plan had 140,000 policyholders in 2018. Since then, the Plan has more than tripled in size, with over 610,000 policies in force as of June 2025, 97% of which were home-insurance policies.

But higher premiums and refusals to renew and write new insurance policies should not be automatically equated with the financial collapse of the insurance industry. For one, insurers have been able to absorb part of the impact of increased losses through subrogation claims. For example, $11 billion of the over $12 billion California insurers paid due to the 2018 Camp Fire was recovered through subrogation claims against Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). PG&E equipment started the fire, which wiped out the town of Paradise, took at least eighty-five lives, and destroyed over 18,000 structures. More generally, insurance rates in California were sufficient to enable the companies to make underwriting profits on home insurance annually from 2019 through 2023, as well as profits on the investment of their reserves.

Both things are true—California property insurers made profits from underwriting and investing between 2019 and 2023, and concluded that the rising risk of severe wildfire meant that they needed to reduce their exposure to loss going forward. They thus decided to write less insurance and demanded even higher prices for the insurance they continued to renew.

California’s recent policy response to the insurance crisis includes a number of regulatory changes that will allow insurers to justify and obtain higher rates and reduce their exposure to an assessment from the California FAIR Plan when it runs out of money to pay claims. While these changes might lead insurers to start writing insurance again in the short run, they will be overrun in the long term by the increased risk and magnitude of loss due to climate change.

California is one of only sixteen states that require property- and casualty-insurance companies to obtain approval from the state insurance commissioner before rates can be increased. Insurers in those states bear the burden of justifying why the rate increase is not “excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.” Insurers’ rates can cover their projected losses, administrative costs, profit, and reserving requirements. The thirty-four other states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico do not regulate rates—insurers are free to set rates as they see fit, and while the rates are filed with the state department of insurance, they are not reviewed or approved before going into effect.

Insurers asked California to amend its rate regulations to allow them to use probabilistic catastrophe models in setting the catastrophe portion of rates. For context, insurers in California had historically been allowed to include an additional “catastrophe” factor or “load” in their rates to reflect rare but severe catastrophe-induced losses that exceed historically typical losses. Insurers could also use probabilistic models to determine rate relativities, that is, adjust base premium rates in light of individual risk characteristics. However, insurers were not permitted to use forward-looking probabilistic models to determine the catastrophe factor in their rates and were instead required to formulate the catastrophe factor based only on historical data. Insurers argued that the growing risks of wildfire due to climate change warranted the use of probabilistic modeling for the catastrophe load or portion of the rate as opposed to relying on past experience. California’s Insurance Commissioner agreed, issuing a regulation effective in January 2025 that allows insurers to use catastrophe models to justify rate increases, with the proviso that they have to increase their insurance writing in areas of high risk.

The next item the insurers requested was the ability to include reinsurance costs, that is, the premiums they pay for reinsurance, in their rates. Unsurprisingly, the price of reinsurance has been climbing—in fact doubling between 2018 and 2023—as reinsurers witness an increase in losses (payouts to insurance companies) for the same reason that insurers are bearing higher losses—more frequent and severe weather-related events. Historically, California was the only state not to allow insurers to include reinsurance premiums in their rates. The Department of Insurance staff reasoned that allowing insurers to increase rates based on reinsurance payouts as well as reinsurance costs would be “double dipping,” because rate increases covered not only insurers’ direct losses but also the portion of their losses covered by reinsurance. Moreover, reinsurance prices are not regulated, and Department staff were concerned that passing on unregulated reinsurance costs to consumers was contrary to the objectives of the state’s rate-regulation law.

However, last year, in the face of insurers declining to write insurance for new customers, the California Insurance Commissioner agreed to the insurers’ request and issued a regulation allowing them to include their reinsurance costs in their rates.

Finally, insurers asked that their exposure to an assessment from the California FAIR Plan be limited. Instead of shouldering the responsibility to cover FAIR Plan shortfalls, insurers wanted to shift that financial liability to all California insurance policyholders, as was done in Florida and Louisiana. Consistent with this request, the California Insurance Commissioner issued an order in 2024 limiting private insurers’ collective exposure to a FAIR Plan shortfall to $500 million. Any additional California FAIR Plan shortfall will be covered through a surcharge on all insurance policyholders—much as in Florida and Louisiana.

With these changes going into effect at the start of 2025, insurers in California indicated they would resume writing new insurance again and write and renew some additional insurance in high-wildfire-risk areas.

But all of these regulatory developments occurred before the wildfires that devastated portions of Los Angeles in early January 2025 and resulted in an estimated $40 billion in insured losses. Faced with over $4 billion in claims, which exceeded its reserves and reinsurance coverage, the California FAIR Plan asked for and received the Insurance Commissioner’s approval of a $1 billion bailout to make up the shortfall.

Under the 2024 order, insurers will be assessed only $500 million collectively, and the remaining $500 million will be collected as a surcharge on top of their insurance premiums from all home-insurance policyholders in the state of California. There is a high potential for additional surcharges, since it is very likely that the California FAIR Plan will need more than $1 billion to pay claims. In June, a California state court determined that the FAIR Plan has been unlawfully limiting or denying payments for smoke damage, which will no doubt increase the payouts the FAIR Plan has to make beyond its projections when it asked for the $1 billion bailout. Given the burdens they shift from insurance companies to California policyholders, will these recent regulatory changes ensure that insurers start writing new insurance in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires?

State Farm—the largest insurer in California —suggests that the answer is no. State Farm received approval for a 17% emergency rate increase in May 2025. The company agreed to refrain from wholesale “block” nonrenewals, but did not agree to refrain from selective nonrenewals of individual homes and small businesses. State Farm continues to request an additional 11% increase on top of the 17% granted in May and a 20% increase approved last year. Notwithstanding these rate increases, State Farm indicated that it will not be able to start writing insurance for new customers.

On the other hand, Mercury and CSAA Insurance Group recently filed for rate increases under the new California rules and indicated that they would resume writing new policyholders, including in high-wildfire-risk areas, if granted the rate increases. Other insurers have said that they will wait to see if, under the new rules, they are able to get substantial rate increases sufficient to cover their projected losses, before deciding whether they will start writing new insurance again. Nevertheless, a recent New York Times investigation found that, despite the regulatory changes allowing for rate increases, insurance nonrenewals increased substantially and that the conditional requirement to write more insurance in high-risk areas has so many loopholes that little if any additional insurance will be written in those areas.

D. Deregulatory Failures: Evidence from Florida and Other States

While California has modified but maintained its strong regulation of insurance rates and insurers generally, Florida has taken a very different approach to address the impact of climate change on insurance pricing and availability. Florida historically has not regulated rates and has taken a number of other recent actions to deregulate the insurance market and reduce insurance-company costs. In addition to Florida, there are thirty-three other states, one territory, and the District of Columbia that do not regulate rates. But their experience shows that in the long term, we are not going to deregulate our way out of the climate-change-driven insurance crisis.

Even in states where rates are unregulated and insurers are free to set rates as high as they want, losses driven by climate change are causing insurers to increase nonrenewals, stop writing new insurance, and depart markets entirely. For example, due to the increased incidence of severe convective storms, at least four insurers in Iowa stopped writing all insurance in the state in 2023.

In 2023, insurers lost money on homeowners’ coverage in eighteen states, more than a third of the country, according to a New York Times analysis. That’s up from twelve states in 2019, and eight states in 2013. Most of those eighteen states are in the interior of the country, hit by tornadoes, derechos, severe storms and hail in the Midwest and Southeast, and wildfires in much of the West. And most of those states do not regulate rates. In response, insurers have not only raised premiums, but have also narrowed coverage, dropped customers, and withdrawn altogether. As these states show, price increases and deregulation are insufficient to prevent insurers’ nonrenewals and withdrawals.

Florida dispels any lingering notions that treating insurers’ every wish as the government’s command will ameliorate the insurance crisis in the long run. As climate change is increasing the intensity of hurricanes and other wind events in Florida over time, the Sunshine State has enacted everything insurers requested of California, and much more.

In Florida, home-insurance rates are deregulated and are four times the national average—and climbing. Florida has allowed catastrophe models to be used to set rates for decades and has developed its own state-run catastrophe model, too. Similarly, Florida has permitted insurers to include reinsurance costs in rates for some time. Florida created two taxpayer-funded reinsurance programs to offer lower-cost reinsurance to private insurers and the Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Florida Citizens), the state’s residual-market insurer of last resort. Still more, Florida decades ago became one of the first states, if not the first state, to eliminate private insurance companies’ responsibility to cover its residual market’s reserve shortfalls and shift that burden to all home and small-business insurance policyholders in Florida. Florida eliminated all of the insurers’ exposure to assessments as opposed to keeping them on the hook for $500 million, as is the case now in California. When Florida Citizens runs out of money to pay claims—and it has—a surcharge is placed on all Florida policyholders, on top of the premium they are paying, in the amount necessary to enable Florida Citizens to pay claims.

Florida’s deregulatory zeal goes further than California’s in other ways, too. Florida recently enacted laws that make it substantially more difficult for aggrieved policyholders or third parties to bring lawsuits against insurance companies. The end result for Florida policyholders has been an increase in claim denials because insurers are emboldened by the diminished threat of lawsuits. Florida’s nonrenewal rate has also climbed rapidly, nearly tripling between 2018 and 2023 from 0.79% to 2.99%, the highest in the nation by over a full percentage point.

To be fair, as of late, new Florida-based and regionally based insurers have entered Florida’s market, and existing insurers in the market are writing more insurance in Florida again. Likewise, the number of Florida Citizens policyholders has declined, although it is still substantially higher than California’s FAIR Plan. But these new companies tend to be poorly capitalized, often startup insurers that are extremely vulnerable to market shocks. For example, seven of twelve new insurers are not traditional property-insurance companies, but “reciprocal exchanges” who are only required to maintain at least $250,000 in surplus funds, as opposed to the minimum reserves of $2.5 million required of traditional insurers. Unsurprisingly, the number of insurers who failed the state financial-fitness test more than doubled over the past year.

Florida’s historical approach to rating insurers’ financial condition is instructive of the long-term effects of relying on financially weak insurers. Since the 1990s, Florida has allowed insurers to use a less rigorous rating agency called Demotech to rate their financial conditions. While that has allowed more insurers to enter the Florida market, those insurance companies are less able to withstand major climate-driven losses. All seven of the Florida insurance-company insolvencies in 2021-2022 were insurers rated by Demotech. Indeed, nineteen percent of Demotech-rated insurers entered insolvency proceedings between 2009 and 2022.

The upshot is that Florida is just one major hurricane away from another wave of insurance-company insolvencies, insurers pulling out of the state again, and a further rise in Florida Citizens policyholders. In the wake of the last major hurricane, at least nine insurance companies became insolvent and unable to pay claims. National insurance companies are not writing insurance in Florida, even with prices four times the national average and all of the deregulatory steps taken above: the risk of substantial losses even at the highest prices is too great.

Florida’s experience demonstrates that price increases and deregulation are not long-term solutions to the climate-driven insurance crisis. The higher rates that will result from recent regulatory changes in California, then, may help in the short or medium term to get insurers to write more insurance in California (although, as discussed above, even that remains an open question). But rate increases and deregulation will eventually be overwhelmed by the rise in risk and increased losses driven by climate change. So, what can and should be done to help keep insurance available in the long run?

II. what can states do to keep insurance available?

There is no “magic wand” that we can wave or regulatory “dial” that we can turn to keep private insurance available in the long run in the face of increasing global temperatures. To slow or stabilize the increased losses experienced by insurers, we need to address climate change itself, which requires a major transition away from burning fossil fuels and from other greenhouse-gas-emitting sectors of the economy. In the meantime, however, states can take a number of steps to help keep insurance available. States should require insurers to end their financial support for the fossil-fuel industry, encourage insurers and residual markets to recover losses from major oil and gas companies through subrogation claims, and require that insurers account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale adaptation and resilience measures. States and local governments should improve building codes to require more resilient homes and businesses and limit development in high-risk areas. In particular, they should require developers of new housing subdivisions in these areas to post a bond with the residual market to cover losses in the event of a disaster. Finally, states should bolster the financial stability of residual markets by authorizing the issuance of bonds, including catastrophe bonds. This Part will discuss and defend each of these recommended steps in turn.

A. States Should Require Insurers to Transition from Insuring and Investing in the Fossil-Fuel Industry

As many scientists have noted, we need more, not less, investment in clean energy and more regulation to move us away from fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and home and commercial heating. To start, insurers must stop propping up the industries that fuel their demise. Because insurers have thus far refused the call, states should require them to transition from insuring and investing in the fossil-fuel industry.

There is an important role for insurers to play in supporting the transition to a net-zero economy. Currently, insurers in the United States are investing over $500 billion in the fossil-fuel industry, whose emissions are creating an existential challenge for the home and business property-insurance market. Globally, twenty-eight major property and casualty insurers collect $11.3 billion annually in premiums from insuring the fossil-fuel industry. Insurers should end their support, through investments and insurance, for the very industry that poses a critical threat to their ability to write insurance. Such a move would be far from symbolic. A recent study found that insurers restricting coverage for coal enterprises contributed to a reduction in coal production and burning, with essentially no financial impact on insurers. Nevertheless, insurers have rejected calls to end their insurance of and investment in the fossil-fuel industry.

It is time for the states to act. As a legal matter, states have broad authority to regulate the underwriting and investing activities of insurers, a power which has been conferred by Congress and repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. States have previously enacted laws that limit which investments meet insurer capital-adequacy requirements and prohibit certain categories of investments. States have also prohibited certain kinds of insurance coverage.

States should exercise this legal authority to require insurers to transition, over a reasonable period of time, away from investing in fossil fuels and writing insurance for the fossil-fuel industry.

While fossil-fuel investments often provide positive returns for investors, insurers can find other investments that also provide positive returns. Moreover, fossil-fuel investments do not always provide positive returns. Consider the bankruptcy of at least sixty-three U.S. coal companies and the decline in the Dow Jones Coal Index over time. The International Energy Agency projects that global demand for fossil fuels will peak in 2030 and then begin to decline. Wind and solar energy are now a lot cheaper than fossil fuels and are growing substantially as a source of energy globally.

Premiums from selling insurance to fossil-fuel companies do provide revenue to some insurers, but the rise of litigation against fossil-fuel companies and the potential that courts will hold them liable for climate-related damage ought to give insurers pause. The premiums collected annually from fossil-fuel enterprises, while not insignificant, are not so large as to be necessary for the financial viability of insurers. If an oil and gas company can’t get insurance, it will have to self-insure. This means that it will have to bear the cost of the risks that insurance would typically cover, such as property damage or liability for third-party injuries. Thus, a successful lawsuit for major damages or losses contributed to by the oil and gas company could reduce its profits or even degrade its financial condition, which could reduce fossil-fuel production and emissions.

It is unlikely that these firms will be able to pass some or all of these costs onto businesses and consumers either indirectly (for example, increased price of plastic containers for businesses that sell goods in plastic containers) or directly (for example, gas price increase). The global price of oil, which largely reflects OPEC production quotas, is the number one factor in the price of gas at the pump, not the costs faced by any one oil and gas company. There is also the question of timing, as companies may not immediately pass on a large loss to consumers. In fact, a recent paper indicates a direct relationship between the magnitude of the pass-through effect and consumer awareness of increased costs, which would presumably be low when the cause is inability to procure liability insurance. Moreover, the cost of insurance currently is a partial measure of the annual cost of risks faced by the fossil-fuel industry. The annual premiums paid by the fossil-fuel industry are a fraction of its overall annual revenues, so having to self-insure will help internalize the costs of its activities and impact its bottom line while resulting in little if any additional pass through of costs beyond that which is already occurring.

One final counterargument that might be raised is that insurers might cease operations in states requiring them to divest from and stop writing insurance for the fossil-fuel industry, in favor of less regulated states where they can continue to insure and invest in fossil-fuel companies. But insurers still earn profits in more regulated states like California, which, by itself, accounts for over ten percent of homeowners-insurance premiums and over thirteen percent of commercial-insurance premiums nationwide. As discussed above, insurers can make investments other than in fossil fuels that provide positive returns. And requiring insurers to transition from writing insurance for fossil fuels should not reduce home-insurance revenues because home insurance is written as a separate line from the general commercial insurance that covers fossil-fuel enterprises. Insurers therefore retain ample incentive to continue operating in states that institute this proposal.

Right now, insurance companies can maximize their profits by providing financial support to the fossil-fuel industry while denying insurance coverage to homes and businesses and passing on costs to consumers through higher rates. Increasingly, insurers can even pass along to policyholders the costs of FAIR Plan/residual-market losses that exceed reserves—that is, costs brought about by the very fossil-fuel industry that insurance companies invest in and insure. It is only fair that the state step in to prevent its residents and businesses from (literally) paying the price for the decisions of insurance companies to invest in and write insurance for the fossil-fuel industry.

B. Sue Oil and Gas Majors

Another important policy solution to help keep insurance available is to hold the major oil and gas companies accountable for their emissions’ contribution to the increased frequency and severity of weather-related disasters. All affected parties, including states and local governments, individuals, private businesses, private insurance companies, and FAIR Plans/residual markets, should exercise legal tools already at their disposal—and be given new ones—to force the oil and gas industry to internalize the costs of its emissions. In the short to medium term, encouraging private insurers and FAIR Plans/residual markets to pursue subrogation claims against fossil-fuel companies could help stabilize insurance markets by reducing the need to increase rates, stop writing insurance, and surcharge policyholders.

States and local governments have begun to bring lawsuits against the oil and gas majors to recover for public expenditures associated with responding to and rebuilding public infrastructure after climate-driven natural catastrophes. States can and should make it easier for private individuals and businesses to recover against oil and gas majors for their emissions’ contribution to climate-driven physical injury or property losses. While public-nuisance doctrine allows for claims against the oil and gas majors for their harm to the general public, state laws do not explicitly address individual physical and property damages associated with oil-and-gas-company emissions. In California, Senate Bill 222, introduced by Senator Scott Wiener in 2025, would create a new cause of action for private individuals and businesses to bring lawsuits against oil and gas majors who misled and deceived the public about the impact of their emissions on climate change. The bill would impose strict liability for property damage caused by fossil-fuel emissions by way of temperature rise and resulting weather-related events. While the bill did not advance this session, it is an example of how states can make it easier for private individuals and businesses to hold the oil and gas majors accountable for their emissions.

States should also enact legislation to encourage insurers to join governments, individuals, and businesses in accountability efforts. Insurers already have the potent tool of subrogation claims, which they should bring against the fossil-fuel companies to recover insurance payouts associated with climate-driven, weather-related disasters. But on their own, insurers are unlikely to bring these lawsuits, given their collective investment of over half a trillion dollars in the fossil-fuel industry. States can insist that increasing rates and not writing insurance are not the only ways that insurers can address rising losses from climate change. In Hawaii, legislation was introduced by Senator Chris Lee to require that the Insurance Commissioner’s approval to increase the catastrophe load—the portion of the rate covering catastrophes—be conditioned on insurers agreeing to bring subrogation claims against oil and gas majors to recover losses from climate-driven natural catastrophes. Likewise, California’s Senate Bill 222 would encourage insurers to bring subrogation claims against oil and gas companies by reducing their assessment in the event of a FAIR Plan reserve shortfall if they bring subrogation claims.

States can also adopt statutes requiring residual markets or FAIR Plans to consider and bring subrogation claims against oil and gas majors to recover losses from climate-driven natural disasters. This will reduce the pressure to increase rates or the need to assess insurers or surcharge policyholders in the event the FAIR Plan/residual market runs out of money. Existing state laws place duties on receivers appointed to oversee the liquidation of insolvent insurance companies to bring claims against third parties to recover assets or monies owed in order to enhance the ability to pay outstanding insurance claims and satisfy other legal obligations. Similarly, states can enact laws placing a duty on residual markets or FAIR Plans to bring subrogation claims against oil and gas majors for climate-driven losses, to help pay for claims and reduce the likelihood and amount of assessments, surcharges, and rate increases. After all, FAIR Plans/residual markets and receivership of insolvent insurers both reflect failures of the private insurance market that force state policymakers to intervene.

Successful subrogation claims will result in oil and gas companies paying out some amount of damages to insurers and residual markets to cover part of their losses. Paying these claims could increase the cost of doing business for oil and gas companies and reduce their profits, especially if the cost is not passed wholly onto consumers. As discussed above, consumers will likely see minimal price increases because, among other reasons, the global price of oil, driven by supply and demand, is the primary factor influencing the price of gas at the pump and is likely a larger determinant of the price than the addition of a marginal cost associated with subrogation-claim payouts. And even if there is an increase in the price of oil and gas products, that cost is outweighed by the loss reduction for insurers and residual markets, which in turn will prevent or slow down rate increases that also land on the backs of consumers and businesses.

C. Enact State Laws to Require Insurers to Account for the Risk-Reduction Benefits of Mitigation in Their Pricing and Underwriting

There is substantial empirical and scientific evidence and a broad-based consensus that adaptation and resilience measures taken at the property, community, and landscape scale can reduce the risk and magnitude of loss from climate-driven perils. States should pass legislation requiring insurers to account for the risk reductions in both their pricing and underwriting models, given that insurers have largely refused to incorporate this information into their models voluntarily. Accounting for risk-reduction measures in pricing and underwriting models will incentivize their adoption, which will, in turn, reduce risk of loss, helping stabilize prices and allow for the renewal and writing of more insurance.

The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), the empirical-research arm of the property and casualty insurers, has developed a list of home-hardening measures that reduce the risk of loss of homes due to wildfire. These include using less combustible roofing and siding materials; protecting vents in the eaves of a home with screens to reduce ember intrusion; using heat-resistant glass for windows and doors so that the heat of the fire does not shatter the glass or door allowing embers to flow into the building; eliminating any wooded structures attached to the home such as decks, sheds, or fences that can be a conduit for the fire; and more. Having “defensible space” around the home, which includes clearing the first five feet of vegetation, limiting vegetation within one hundred feet from the home, and eliminating overhanging tree canopy, also reduces the risk of loss due to wildfire. Community-level adaptation includes keeping a distance between newly constructed homes to reduce house-to-house spread, creating fire breaks around the community, and reducing brush and vegetation in the community. Landscape-scale mitigation of wildfire risk includes using prescribed fire and thinning of forests and chaparral lands to reduce the fuel load and, in the forest context, eliminating “ladder fuels” like small trees and bushes, which become conduits for fire to move into the tree canopy.

With regard to hurricanes, other wind events, and severe convective storms, the IBHS has relied on empirical testing to develop a “fortified home” standard for roofing and other elements of the home, which reduces the risk of wind, hail, and heavy rain damage and loss.

While these measures at the property, community, and landscape scale do not guarantee that individual homes will not be damaged or destroyed by a wildfire, hurricane, or other climate-driven peril, they significantly reduce the risk of loss. Increased federal, state, local, and private expenditures and investments in property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation are needed to help reduce the risk of loss and, correspondingly, make it possible for insurers to keep writing insurance for areas hit by climate-change-driven catastrophes. Insurers need to do their part by taking these risk-reduction measures into account.

Both the public and private sectors are already investing substantially in landscape-scale mitigation for severe wildfires, for example. At the federal level, the bipartisan infrastructure bill enacted in the first year of the Biden Administration contained $5.1 billion for forest management and other fuel-reduction measures on federal lands across the United States. California has appropriated $4 billion for landscape-scale forest-fuel reduction through prescribed fire and thinning in the last few years. In 2024, California voters passed Proposition 4, which authorizes the sale of Climate Bonds that will raise an additional $1.5 billion for landscape-scale forest management to reduce wildfire risk. On the local level, cities and counties in California are taxing their residents and spending money on community- and landscape-scale fuel reduction and forest-treatment projects. Mitigation efforts extend to the neighborhood level, where private homeowners associations are collecting fees from their members to pay for landscape-scale forest and chaparral management projects.

State-sponsored risk-reduction efforts are not limited to California. To assist homeowners in fortifying their homes against wind and hurricanes, a number of states on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts have enacted limited grant programs and other financial incentives to help homeowners with the cost of retrofitting their home to meet the IBHS fortified-home standard. In the Midwest, nature-based solutions to reduce river flood risk are also being implemented.

While more federal, state, local, and private investments are needed for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation, homeowners and businessowners who spend thousands of dollars on home hardening, HOA fees, and local, state and federal taxes for mitigation measures are justifiably frustrated when their insurer fails to account for these mitigation measures in deciding whether to write or renew them insurance.

Insurance models used for pricing and underwriting have the technical capacity to account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in setting a risk score for particular properties. However, when deciding whether to write or renew insurance, only two insurers out of hundreds in California account for mitigation in the risk-score models they use to decide whether to write or renew insurance.

As insurers were not voluntarily accounting for risk-reduction measures in pricing, some states, like California and Alabama, adopted requirements that insurers provide homeowners with a premium discount for home hardening against wildfire (California) or wind (Alabama). But in these states, insurers issue discounts to homeowners for home-hardening measures yet still refuse to renew or write them insurance. This means that you can be eligible for a home-hardening discount, but the insurer will still not renew your policy or write you insurance, which makes the discount for mitigation effectively worthless. Thus, to properly incentivize risk-reduction measures, states will need to require that insurers incorporate property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation into their models when deciding to write or renew insurance.

Insurers may complain that there is not one database to which they can look to obtain information as to whether homeowners or businesses have undertaken mitigation measures. But insurance companies routinely ask current and prospective customers for information about their homes and businesses to decide whether to write insurance. Recall the list of questions you were asked the last time you shopped for new property insurance. Customers are asked the age of the home, what materials were used in construction, the age of the roof, the materials used for the roof, the number and type of rooms, whether there is a basement, crawl space or the house is on a concrete slab, how the home is heated and cooled, and more. Insurers can simply ask the customer if they have undertaken home hardening and, for wildfire risk, defensible space, just as they ask all sorts of other questions to collect data to input into their models or underwriting guidelines to decide whether to write insurance for the home.

Data on community- or landscape-level mitigation is also available. For example, the State of California maintains a database of the locations of forest-treatment projects to reduce the risk of wildfire, which insurers can access to obtain data to account for community- and landscape-scale mitigation in their modeling.

The insurance industry clearly has the technical capacity to use this readily available data to account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in setting a risk score for particular properties. As discussed previously, the insurance industry has established empirically based standards for home hardening against wind, wildfire, hail, and heavy rain. Thus, there is a list of items that the insurance industry’s own research arm has developed, about which the customer can be asked, to obtain data to account for property-level mitigation in their models. Further, the availability of data and the ease of incorporating it into models dispels worries that requiring insurers to take into account property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation would result in substantial additional costs.

Just this year, Colorado grew tired of waiting for insurers to account for risk-reduction measures in their pricing and underwriting models, and took action. With the support of Colorado Insurance Commissioner Mike Conway, the state enacted H.B. 25-1182, which requires insurers to account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in the computer models they use to set prices and to decide whether to write or renew insurance. In my view, this is the most important property-insurance law to be enacted this year (if not in several years) anywhere in the United States and should serve as a model for other states to follow.

D. States and Local Governments Should Update Building and Zoning Codes

Just as states and local governments should incentivize the adoption of mitigation measures from the bottom up by requiring insurers to account for them in their pricing models, they should leverage their authority over building and zoning codes in a top-down manner to mandate safer building practices and development patterns.

Strong building codes help reduce the risk and magnitude of loss. For example, homes in Paradise, California, built after the latest major building-code upgrade were substantially more likely to survive the firestorm than those built before. Conversely, in North Carolina, the state legislature delayed updates to the building codes, which resulted in more homes suffering more damage and loss than if they were built under the updated codes.

Zoning codes can also reduce the risk and magnitude of loss. Building houses too close together, for example, can accelerate the spread of fire from home to home. Local zoning codes should take into account the latest science with regard to mitigating the risk of climate-driven perils in that particular geography. State laws should limit the ability to approve more low-density homes in high-risk areas.

There is no inevitable tradeoff here that will result in increased housing costs. Even in high-risk areas, states and local governments should eliminate code provisions that don’t improve resilience but add substantial costs to housing development, like requiring parking or requiring two stairwells in multistory multiunit structures. At the same time, state laws should also require local zoning codes to facilitate more housing in lower-risk areas, such as by allowing higher-density housing structures (duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, and mid- and high-density multifamily structures). This would address both the short-term and long-term causes of the insurance crisis. Land-use regulations account for up to 10% of the cost of wildfire risk by limiting development and raising rents in urban cores, which results in more development in urban peripheries subject to higher wildfire risk. Similarly, in coastal regions, single-family zoning can limit the ability to move to nearby areas with lower flood risks. Relaxing these regulations would therefore prevent further migration to higher-risk areas and help people move out of harm’s way. It would also allow for more people to live in more compact development patterns, which reduces vehicle miles traveled and overall emissions associated with housing.

E. States Should Curb Development in High-Risk Areas

Over time, states and local governments have approved more development in areas at high risk of loss from river flooding, coastal flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and other climate-driven perils. The presence of more homes and businesses in high-risk areas has contributed to insurance-company losses. Instead, states should limit and discourage development in high-risk areas. One insurance-related example discussed further below would require developers of new housing subdivisions in high-risk areas to post a bond with FAIR Plans/residual markets that will be used to cover losses in the event of a natural disaster.

The rising price and declining availability of insurance in higher-risk areas sends a strong market signal that these are, in fact, areas of high risk. But that signal alone has not been enough to overcome homeowners’ demand for housing in these areas, which creates profits for real-estate developers and revenue for local governments. Rather than addressing the underlying cause of the problem and reducing development in high-risk areas, states require their FAIR Plans or residual markets to keep insurance available for new and existing homes built in areas at high risk of loss. And in the case of flood risk, the federal government created a flood-insurance product for homes and small businesses at risk of flooding, which encouraged new development in areas at high risk of flooding.

States and local governments should enact laws to reduce or limit new development in higher-risk areas. States can map areas of high risk and limit development in those areas accordingly. It bears emphasis that decades of exclusionary land-use policy demonstrate that states and localities are adept at limiting development when they want to.

Like with the last proposal, one objection here might be that limiting development in high-risk areas will limit housing supply in the state. If the state has a housing shortage, limiting supply through restrictions or limitations on development in high-risk areas arguably would keep housing prices higher than they should be otherwise, increase the number of rent-burdened households, and contribute to homelessness.

However, limiting or restricting development in high-risk areas does not entail a reduction in overall housing supply. First, allowing greater density of structures on infill parcels can provide more supply without developing outward into areas of high risk. Second, the state can and should require local governments to allow higher-density structures throughout the state in areas that are not high risk, to increase supply of housing as needed and to offset any loss associated with restricting or limiting development in high-risk areas. Indeed, recent studies demonstrate that housing demand can be met nationally with more compact development at higher densities, which also provides substantial benefits in terms of greenhouse-gas-emission reductions.

One way that states could reduce development in high-risk areas would be to require developers of new housing in high-risk areas to internalize the risks and cost of having to rebuild that housing in the event of a climate-driven event. Specifically, in high-risk areas, developers of new subdivisions should be required to post a bond with the FAIR Plan or residual market, instead of shifting the risk and cost of rebuilding to private insurers, or more likely, to the FAIR Plan or residual market. In the event of losses due to a wildfire, hurricane, or other climate-driven event, the FAIR Plan would use the bond amount to cover the losses. The bond amount should match the expected losses for the subdivision, determined according to the same models used by private insurers. Also, the determination of expected FAIR Plan or residual-market insurance losses for the subdivision should account for home hardening and other risk-reduction measures in order to incentivize risk mitigation, as described above.

By requiring the posting of a long-term bond, the developer would be held responsible for a cost that it otherwise externalizes to the FAIR Plan or residual market, and thus ultimately to all insurers and policyholders. Developers may pass the cost of the bond along to prospective homeowners, but in the case of developments in high-risk areas, increased costs and reduced demand are a virtue rather than a vice. In some cases, having to take the risk of wildfire into account will mean that the development will not be economically viable, which would be a successful policy outcome.

The bond requirement should survive legal challenges arguing that it violates the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Under the Takings Clause, conditions on development like the bond requirement are subject to an “essential nexus” and “rough proportionality” analysis. As the U.S. Supreme Court, in Sheetz v. County of El Dorado, explained last year, the first prong requires an “essential nexus” between the permit conditions and the land-use interest, which “ensures that the government is acting to further its stated purpose, not leveraging its permitting monopoly to exact private property without paying for it.” The second prong demands a “rough proportionality” between the impact on the state interest and the permit conditions such that the landowner cedes only what “is necessary to mitigate harms resulting from new development.”

Here, the “essential nexus” between the bond requirement and the state interest is clear. The bond accounts for “the social costs of the applicant’s proposal.” Development in a high-risk area will increase reliance on the state-created FAIR Plan, which will have to pay to cover damage to homes in the development. Likewise, the “rough proportionality” standard is met because the bond does not exceed the amount needed to cover future FAIR Plan insurance payouts for homes burned in the development.

F. States Should Support FAIR Plans and Residual Markets with Bond Financing

In addition to reducing high-risk development, another benefit of the previous proposal is the infusion of much-needed funds to cash-strapped FAIR plans and residual markets. To further bolster the financial stability of FAIR plans and residual markets, states should authorize them to sell bonds to cover financial shortfalls and to improve their negotiating positions with reinsurers through the issuance of catastrophe bonds.

For example, California recently enacted legislation to allow the state to sell bonds and raise funds to cover shortfalls in FAIR Plan reserves. While the FAIR Plan would need to repay the bonds over time, bond financing can help reduce the immediate need for the FAIR Plan to collect an assessment from insurers or a surcharge from policyholders. Although insurers and policyholders will likely need to be assessed or surcharged over time to repay the bondholders, bond financing would effectively allow for amortization of assessments and surcharges and thus reduce sudden price shocks.

States should also pass legislation to allow FAIR Plans and residual markets to issue catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities as an alternative source of risk transfer. As discussed earlier, catastrophe bonds are financial instruments that allow insurers to transfer risks to capital markets through complex four-way transactions. In form, catastrophe bonds look like normal debt vehicles—investors purchase bonds and receive annual interest payments. However, if a predefined loss or risk-related trigger occurs within a certain period and losses exceed a specified attachment point, the investors forfeit their right to the principal used to purchase the bonds, which then goes to the insurer. If the loss or risk-related trigger does not occur within the specified period, the investors get their principal back (and keep the high interest payments). While catastrophe bonds require the FAIR Plan to pay interest to bondholders, they can provide competition to reinsurers and help obtain better-negotiated reinsurance pricing for the FAIR Plan. In fact, both California and Florida have previously issued catastrophe bonds in order to bolster residual markets for earthquake and hurricane insurance, respectively.

III. congress should establish a federal reinsurance program and means-tested premium subsidy for fair plans and residual markets

Congress should enact a federal reinsurance program for state FAIR Plans and residual markets to help offset the cost of private reinsurance and enable access to more reinsurance. The federal government should also institute a subsidy program to enable low-income households to afford the high premiums charged by FAIR Plans/residual markets. These two measures would work in tandem to enhance the affordability of FAIR Plans/residual markets while sending accurate market signals about the risk of loss. While a federal all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme is an alternative that would have some advantages, a narrower reinsurance and subsidy scheme for FAIR Plans/residual markets shares its advantages while avoiding some of its flaws.

Currently, FAIR Plans and residual markets turn to the private reinsurance market to cover some of their exposure to losses. Reinsurers have been raising rates in the face of climate change, which raises costs for FAIR Plans and residual markets and requires that they raise premium prices for their policyholders. As they cover homeowners and businesses with the highest risk, FAIR Plan and residual-market premiums are generally higher than the private market. More and more homeowners are going without home insurance as they cannot find private insurance and cannot afford FAIR Plan or residual-market insurance. Over thirteen percent of all homes in the United States are uninsured —a substantial increase from five percent in 2019.

A lower-cost federal reinsurance program would help FAIR Plans and residual markets offer lower prices. A federal reinsurance program that does not seek profits, that is exempt from state and federal taxation, and whose reserves are funded by U.S. taxpayers would be able to offer reinsurance at a lower price than private reinsurers, along with better terms such as lower attachment points and more coverage than private reinsurers are willing to take on. The lower costs and broader coverage of reinsurance would go hand-in-hand with higher availability. Namely, the federal program would help reduce the likelihood that state FAIR Plans and residual markets have to assess private insurers to make up for shortfalls, thus encouraging more private underwriting.

In addition to a federal reinsurance program, the federal government should establish a premium subsidy program for lower-income households on a sliding-scale basis to assist them in paying for FAIR Plan and residual-market insurance. FAIR Plan and residual-market rates should reflect the actual risk of loss, both to improve the likelihood that they will have sufficient funds to pay claims in the event of a disaster and to send an accurate market signal that climate change is increasing the risk of loss. Subsidizing the premium for low-income households does not artificially suppress the premium rate or the market signal associated with the rate. An income-based sliding-scale premium assistance program, much like the state and federal health-benefits exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), would enable lower-income households to afford FAIR Plan insurance.

A. A Federal All-Risk Disaster Insurance Scheme Would Send the Wrong Price Signal About Risk and Deepen Inequities

With the onset of the insurance crisis at the state level, there are calls for federal interventions in insurance markets that go well beyond a federal reinsurance and premium subsidy program for state FAIR Plans. This Section will focus on one such proposal—an all-risk, all-disaster national home and small-business property-insurance scheme. While a national all-risk, all-disaster insurance program would have some benefits, on balance, the disadvantages and poor historical performance of federal insurance programs make the reinsurance and premium-subsidy approach for FAIR Plans and residual markets a better alternative. A federal all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme would cost much more, send the wrong price signal about climate-driven risk, supplant the private market, and be more regressive, unlike a narrower federal reinsurance and subsidy scheme.

1. Advantages

A national scheme would spread the risk of loss among all policyholders across the nation who purchase insurance from the scheme. Assuming the insurance program is risk-rated, those facing higher risks would pay more and those facing lower risks would pay less. Spreading the risk nationally, as opposed to at the state level, may help make insurance more available in smaller markets where there is less opportunity to spread risk.

The public scheme would be nonprofit, so its rates should be naturally lower than private insurers. However, underwriting profits for private property insurers can be relatively low and sometimes nonexistent, so there might not be a large comparative reduction in rate. On the other hand, the national-insurance scheme would not pay federal income tax or state premium taxes, which should further help reduce rates. And assuming that the national program is required to maintain adequate reserves to pay claims and that it can invest those reserves, the returns from the investments would not be paid as profits to shareholders or owners but rather could be added to reserves and/or used to reduce the premium price that the program needs to collect. Indeed, nonprofit-governance rules require that financial decisions further the mission of the nonprofit, which here would be to provide affordable property insurance to Americans in every corner of the country.

The national scheme could also include a premium subsidy for lower-income households like that provided for health insurance sold in state and federal health-benefit exchanges under the ACA. And, in line with the best practices described in Section II.C, a national scheme could account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in pricing. This would create an incentive for homeowners, communities, and states to invest in mitigation, which would reduce the risk of loss across more properties, communities, and geographies.

The availability of the national-insurance scheme in a state could be conditioned on the state taking action to improve building and zoning codes, limit new development in high-risk areas, and invest in adaptation and resilience programs, all of which would help to reduce risk of loss for the national-insurance scheme. On the other hand, states are often resistant when the federal government tells them what to do, which raises doubt as to whether an insurance scheme enacted with such conditions could be truly national. For example, ten states still refuse to adopt the Medicaid expansion under the ACA.

A national-insurance program would allow states to eliminate their FAIR Plans or residual markets, which would become redundant. This in turn would reduce the potential for assessments on private insurers and surcharges on policyholders in states like California and Florida. If the national scheme enjoys the full financial backing of the federal government, then it may not need to purchase reinsurance, which could further help to reduce premiums. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Congress would put the federal treasury on the hook to cover the losses of the national scheme. More likely, the national-insurance scheme would be capitalized with an initial infusion of federal funds or federal loans but then be required to set rates sufficient to maintain reserves to pay claims. Under this setup, purchasing private reinsurance may be a useful addition to the claims-paying capacity of the national scheme.

2. Negative Consequences

Even taking these positive elements of a national-insurance program at face value, there are a number of negative consequences that also require consideration. The historical record of national-insurance schemes is spotty, to put it mildly.

For starters, national-insurance schemes have failed to set rates based on risk, which results in underpricing. This means that insufficient premiums are collected to cover losses, demanding major taxpayer subsidies to maintain claims-paying capacity. The Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP), for example, does not charge farmers premiums that actually reflect the risk of loss. As a result, the FCIP is heavily subsidized by federal taxpayers. Similarly, the rates of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) did not reflect the actual risk of loss for decades. In fact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which manages NFIP, repeatedly reduced premiums for wealthy oceanfront dwellers by redrawing maps to place them in a less risky flood zone, even when their properties had previously suffered flood losses. As a result, taxpayers have had to bail out the NFIP.

Because national-insurance schemes have not set rates based on risk, they send the wrong price signal about the risks associated with the activities or property they are insuring. For example, the FCIP does not provide lower rates for regenerative agriculture practices even though there is substantial evidence that these practices reduce the risk of loss. And the NFIP, whose rates did not accurately reflect the risk of loss until recently at best, has incentivized more development of homes and businesses in areas at high risk of flooding. To be fair, as discussed earlier, private-property insurers often do not adjust their rates or underwriting to reflect risk-reduction measures. However, it is an entirely different matter and a much bigger problem if the rates fail to account for the likely losses from the peril (flooding) itself, as has been the case with the NFIP.

National-insurance schemes likewise do not actually “underwrite”—determine the risk of loss and decide whether to assume it—because they write the insurance regardless of the risk of loss. For example, with limited exceptions, the NFIP will write flood insurance regardless of the risk of flooding where homes are located. This eliminates an important (albeit, so far substantially ignored) signal about the risk of loss associated with developing homes and businesses in a high-risk area. Unlike private home insurance, where insurers may send an important signal about the risk of new development in an area by declining to write or renew insurance, there is no such market signal sent by the NFIP, other than its price, which historically has not reflected risk. Although FAIR Plans also write insurance regardless of the risk of loss, they are not funded by taxpayer dollars.

National-insurance schemes have been very regressive. The FCIP requires that low-income households pay federal taxes to subsidize crop insurance for large corporate owners of agricultural lands. And the minority of Americans who are renters are subsidizing flood insurance for the 65% of Americans who are homeowners, even though renters typically earn lower incomes and have less overall wealth than homeowners.

National-insurance schemes have also tended to supplant the private market. While Congress created NFIP in the 1960s in response to private home insurers excluding coverage for flood insurance, it now writes about 95% of home and small-business flood insurance in the United States. Efforts to get private insurers to cover flood risk have failed, as the NFIP premiums, even if increasingly risk-adjusted, are still lower than the rates at which private insurers can make a profit. Supplanting the private insurance market means that the benefits of a private market for insurance are potentially lost, including access to risk transfer to private capital markets, innovation in developing new insurance products, risk-rated pricing, and sending market signals about risk through pricing and reduced underwriting.

There is one example of a national-insurance scheme that did not supplant the private market, but that program was narrow and limited, unlike an all-risk, all-disaster national home and small-business property-insurance scheme. In the wake of 9/11, when insurance companies stopped insuring commercial buildings in urban centers due to the risk of terrorism, Congress enacted the national Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) and program. TRIA is a federal-insurance backstop, which kicks in to reimburse insurers for commercial-property-related claims above a certain level in the event of major losses from a major terrorist event. Unlike FCIP and NFIP, TRIA has worked as intended. Private insurers started underwriting commercial buildings again, bolstered by TRIA’s ability to pick up major catastrophic losses. But TRIA is for a specific type of loss, much narrower than the broad, guaranteed, and growing losses that would be covered under a proposed all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme. Further, TRIA is a backstop, not an insurance program per se. In sum, TRIA does not supply evidence to counter the likelihood that a national all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme will supplant most if not all of the private-insurance market.

A narrower federal scheme of reinsurance for private home insurers would share many of these flaws. It is likely not to be risk-rated and thus will send the wrong price signal to insurers. It is also likely to require a regressive taxpayer subsidy and a large one at that, with renters, who tend to be lower-income, subsidizing reinsurance for private home insurance. Further, the nonprofit reinsurance program’s ability to offer lower rates may cause it to supplant the private reinsurance market and its ability to access private capital markets to spread risk. To make up the difference, even more federal reinsurance might be required. Finally, even if there are conditions placed on states to enable insurers to access federal reinsurance, their willingness to comply with those conditions may be low.

Given the relative costs and benefits of a national scheme, the better approach is still the more targeted federal program of reinsurance for FAIR Plans/residual markets and a premium-subsidy program for low-income households who depend on FAIR Plans/residual markets. A narrower federal reinsurance program for FAIR Plans and residual markets avoids supplanting the private-insurance markets and private-reinsurance markets for private insurers. It would not send an incorrect price signal to developers and homebuyers about the risk of loss in an area, since those prices would still be set by private insurers (and approved by regulators in rate-regulated states) and FAIR Plans/residual markets. The narrower FAIR Plan reinsurance program would be far less regressive because it will require less federal funding, and will help those who are in greatest need—households who cannot obtain insurance on the private market and are forced to purchase insurance through a FAIR Plan. The progressive premium subsidy targeted to lower income households would also lessen the regressive impact.

Conclusion

The insurance crisis is driven by the climate crisis. In response to rising losses due to climate-driven events, insurers are increasing prices and decreasing the availability of insurance. Policy responses to date have focused on deregulation (Florida) or modifying existing rate regulations (California) to allow for higher rates conditioned on writing more insurance. The deregulatory approach comes at a heavy expense to policyholders, in the form of higher rates and the inability of less regulated insurers to pay claims when the next disaster strikes. Both approaches fail to address underlying causes of the losses—emissions from the fossil-fuel industry and increased development in high-risk areas.

States, localities, and the federal government should implement a number of policy responses that can help make insurance more available. These include insurer-focused measures, like requiring insurers to transition from investing in and writing insurance for the fossil-fuel industry, to bring subrogation claims to recover from oil and gas companies for their share of losses associated with their emissions, and to account for risk-reduction measures in both pricing and underwriting—the decision whether to write or renew insurance. Land-use policy interventions are also warranted. States and local governments should update building and zoning codes to reduce the risk of loss and restrict new development in high-risk areas while meeting statewide housing demand by requiring higher-density development in low-risk areas. One specific measure to reduce high-risk development would require developers in high-risk areas to post a bond with the FAIR Plan or residual market to cover expected losses, which would have the added benefit of providing financial support to beleaguered FAIR Plans and residual markets. States should further shore up the finances of FAIR Plans and residual markets by allowing them to issue bonds, including catastrophe bonds.

The federal government must also take action to address the nationwide insurance crisis, while learning from the mistakes of its previous interventions in private insurance markets. Rather than establishing a federal all-risk all-disaster insurance or reinsurance program, Congress should enact a narrower federal reinsurance program for FAIR Plans and residual markets and a means-tested premium subsidy for low-income households forced to buy insurance through the FAIR Plan or residual market.

But in the long run, these stopgaps will be outrun by the growing risk and magnitude of losses from climate change. To preserve an insurable future, we need to transition from burning fossil fuels and from other greenhouse gas-emitting sectors. Otherwise, the insurance “canary in the coal mine” will sing no more.",,N,,2025-12-02 23:57:37.024777

The study, by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and Traction Energy Indonesia, highlights that Indonesia’s shift away from coal presents a powerful opportunity to meet its 2030 climate targets while strengthening local economies—provided the transition is managed carefully and inclusively.

In coal-dependent regions, where coal contributes up to 80% of GDP, and many residents work informally, qualitative research through focus group discussions, interviews, and community engagement revealed that people are deeply concerned about how they will sustain livelihoods beyond coal. These insights also surfaced gender-specific challenges and local priorities that modelling alone often misses. Many communities feel excluded from decision making and uncertain about their future: women see fewer re-employment opportunities, youth are anxious about education and jobs, and older residents worry about reduced welfare support.

The study also used economic modelling to examine the potential impacts of coal closures and identify pathways to safeguard jobs, local economies, and vulnerable groups across five coal-intensive regencies and five provinces in Indonesia. The effects of the energy transition varied widely across regencies.

For example, potential job losses ranged from 5,000 in Sarolangun regency to 24,500 in Muara Enim. The employment impact did not always correspond directly with the magnitude of economic losses, reflecting structural differences in industrial composition and labour intensity across Indonesia’s coal-producing regions.

Unsurprisingly, the more diversified economies showed greater resilience against coal closures. These findings reinforce the need for region-specific just transition strategies, including economic diversification, worker retraining, welfare support, and investment in sustainable sectors tailored to the local economic structure.

“Accelerating the energy transition offers Indonesia a chance to build new industries and create more resilient, inclusive economies,” said Bathandwa Vazi, policy advisor, IISD. “If we prepare early, coal-dependent regions can transform risk into opportunity—protecting decades of development progress and driving new pathways for growth.”

At the provincial scale, East Kalimantan’s economy is currently highly dependent on coal, meaning the province faces significant exposure in a transition, including output losses of USD 42 billion, sectoral income decline of USD 5.5 billion, and over 490,000 jobs at risk.

Yet the modelling also shows a clear pathway forward: with targeted investment in dynamic sectors like food and beverage manufacturing and renewable energy, the region could not only offset projected losses—it could generate up to 2.5 million new jobs and build a more diverse, resilient economy.A just energy transition will also require targeted policies for informal workers, including retraining for green sectors, support for small to medium-sized enterprises, and robust social protection. Such measures are essential to ensure the transition promotes equitable outcomes for communities most at risk. Policies need to be developed with communities and workers to ensure their needs and priorities are addressed in the final package.

“Our findings show deep regional disparities in how the coal transition will impact communities. Transition planning can turn risks into opportunities for more stable, inclusive, and sustainable long-term growth, but communities need to be involved every step of the way,” says Refina Muthia Sundari, program manager at Traction Energy Asia. For policy-makers, the lesson is clear: to succeed, just transition policies must be locally informed, gender responsive, and rooted in inclusive, multi-level governance. By prioritizing green sector development, gender equality, disability and social inclusion (GEDSI), and institutional coordination, Indonesia can transition from a coal-dependent economy to a resilient, low-carbon, and inclusive future.

Eastman's 2025 Sustainability Report presents its advancements and ongoing efforts toward its climate and circularity objectives.

The organisation's climate strategy is central to its operations, with a primary goal of achieving net zero by 2050. This is supported by a decarbonisation plan that emphasises energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources.

Eastman has set a target to lower its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2035. To this end, Eastman has 50 active energy efficiency projects underway globally, including at its large manufacturing sites in Tennessee and Texas.

Eastman's climate strategy and decarbonisation

Eastman is focused on procuring renewable energy for its facilities and developing low-carbon technologies.

These include thermal batteries and carbon capture, which could be vital for decarbonising energy-intensive industrial processes and achieving substantial emissions reductions. The report highlights how material innovation is key to its strategy.

Mark Costa, CEO at Eastman, says: “As we continue to navigate a challenging global economic environment, we remain committed to a strategy built on growth through innovation that aligns with sustainability macro trends. That strategy is working and our focus on sustainable innovation is delivering our business results and reinforces our purpose to enhance the quality of life in a material way.

""Our 2025 Sustainability Report is an ideal place to learn more about our growth strategy and how material innovation is vital to building A Better Circle.”

Eastman is also developing material solutions that directly address its climate impact. One such solution is molecular recycling, which processes hard-to-recycle waste to produce new materials with up to 50% lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods.

Strategic partnerships in carbon capture

To further its climate objectives, Eastman is engaging in strategic partnerships.

Its involvement with the Global Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Institute connects it with governments, corporations, research bodies and NGOs. This collaboration is designed to share best practices and promote scientific advancements in carbon capture technology.

According to Eastman's report, carbon capture and storage solutions could be instrumental in reducing emissions, particularly from heavy industry.

One of Eastman’s primary objectives is to establish a circular economy for plastics. Eastman has a goal to recycle at least 500 million pounds of plastic waste each year by 2030. This amount is equivalent to preventing 22 billion single-use water bottles from entering landfills.

Chris Killian, Chief Sustainability Officer at Eastman, says: “Eastman has the opportunity to make a substantial positive impact through better, more sustainable materials. We can help solve global issues like plastic waste through circular plastics and biodegradable cellulosic polymers that reduce environmental impact.

""For the sake of future generations, product innovation in the materials industry must be more sustainable.”

Molecular recycling and the circular economy

Unlike traditional mechanical recycling, which cannot process many everyday items like carpets, polyester clothing or coloured PET bottles, Eastman’s molecular recycling technology can. This process breaks down these complex waste products to create its Renew materials.

These materials are supplied to global manufacturing markets and are indistinguishable from plastics made from virgin resources.

The report states that “the world needs molecular recycling and mechanical recycling working in tandem to reduce waste”.

Eastman operates the world’s largest polyester molecular recycling facility at its site in Kingsport, Tennessee, which opened in March 2024. In its first year and a half of operation, the facility has recycled more than 100 million pounds of plastic waste.

Eastman is also collaborating with recycling firms globally to improve recycling infrastructure, aiming to keep more plastic out of landfills.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/3fc4a57de8a74f35a0563a8da1ce9ff6:c78bb4ef13f5a2a669f39e659389ca4f/1615221489856-e-1766016000-v-beta-t-lgf5fkp1xhk1djgnfh8jfkzb2y39-vjnyfvrdusgwo.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 21:58:48.556178

Hybrid cooling towers to save water Under the MoU, Fermi and MVM EGI will define cooling requirements, evaluate tower configurations, and assess site and height constraints.
“MVM EGI has been on the cutting-edge of power cooling for more than half a century, maintaining the heritage of our founders, Professor László Heller and Professor László Forgó whom the high-capacity water-saving dry cooling systems are named after worldwide,” stated MVM EGI P.L.C.
In October, the company signed an agreement with Energy Transfer to connect to nearby pipeline infrastructure by Q1 2026.","On December 1, Fermi America signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Hungarian power-cooling specialist MVM EGI Zrt.

The partnership aims to develop advanced cooling systems for Fermi’s planned data center and energy campus in Amarillo, Texas, which could reach up to 11GW in capacity.

The two companies will start by doing engineering and feasibility studies for a set of indirect hybrid cooling towers. These towers are intended to support up to 6 GW of planned natural gas generation and four AP1000 nuclear reactors on the campus.

Hybrid cooling towers to save water

Under the MoU, Fermi and MVM EGI will define cooling requirements, evaluate tower configurations, and assess site and height constraints. They will also model the water-saving potential of hybrid cooling at scale.

“MVM EGI has been on the cutting-edge of power cooling for more than half a century, maintaining the heritage of our founders, Professor László Heller and Professor László Forgó whom the high-capacity water-saving dry cooling systems are named after worldwide,” stated MVM EGI P.L.C. CEO Péter Kárpáti.

The cooling design primarily uses air and closed-loop water circulation to reduce evaporative loss. The companies also plan to explore recycled water, underground reservoirs, and solar-covered retention ponds to further conserve resources.

Construction on the first tower is expected to start in January 2026, with full build-out by 2034.

Local leadership and regional commitment

The operator emphasized that the project is rooted in the local community.

“Fermi isn’t some out-of-town operation parachuting in. Our leadership is from West Texas — we grew up on this dirt, and we care about the land and its resources,” said Fermi America Co-Founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer.

Neugebauer added, “As promised, we’re working with global innovators like MVM to ensure Project Matador complements the long-term water needs of the region, building something big, but doing it the right way.”

Ambitious data center and energy plans

Project Matador, to be developed on Texas Tech University land, could become one of the largest data center campuses in the world. It will cover 18 million square feet (1.67 million square meters) and combine natural gas, solar, wind, and nuclear energy to power operations.

The company has already secured multiple energy deals. In October, the company signed an agreement with Energy Transfer to connect to nearby pipeline infrastructure by Q1 2026. Earlier, it reached a non-binding deal with Siemens for up to 1.1GW of gas turbines and purchased more than 600MW of natural gas capacity through separate transactions.

For nuclear power, the project team plans four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, each with a capacity of roughly 1,100–1,117 MWe. The company is working with Westinghouse on a Combined Operating License Application to speed approvals.

The project has drawn major investment, including a successful IPO in October that valued the company at $14.8 billion. Earlier funding included $100 million in Series C equity led by Macquarie Group and a $250 million senior loan.

Even with strong support, the project has challenges. The first two phases are expected to cost more than $2 billion, and the long timeline for AP1000 reactors could make it harder for the campus to reach its 11GW goal.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IE-Photo-72.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 02:59:27.382186

The Department of Energy announced it renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to the “National Laboratory of the Rockies” effective immediately on Monday.
Colorado saw “substantial growth” in renewable energy consumption between 2005 and 2022.
Bush renamed it the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to reflect its growing range and designated the site as an official national lab.
“For decades, this laboratory and its scientific capabilities have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible and delivered impact to the nation,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director of the now-named National Laboratory of the Rockies, in the announcement.","The National Renewable Energy Laboratory based in Golden has a new name to match the shift in U.S. energy policy under President Donald Trump.

The Department of Energy announced it renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to the “National Laboratory of the Rockies” effective immediately on Monday.

The renaming of the lab is meant to highlight the Trump administration’s desire to invest in cheaper energy sources of all kinds, rather than focusing on renewable alternatives, the agency said.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” said Assistant Secretary of Energy Audrey Robertson in a news release. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources.”

The laboratory sits on a 327-acre campus in Golden by South Table Mountain. It also has a facility 13 miles north called the Flatirons Campus near Boulder.

The Trump administration wants to focus its priorities on building scientific research to “restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand,” Robertson added, in which the National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a “vital role.”

The Trump administration has pushed toward what it calls “energy dominance,” an initiative to remove regulations that are “ideologically motivated” and to limit as many barriers as possible to drive energy costs down.

The Department of Energy is led by Chris Wright, a Denver businessman and founder of oil company Liberty Energy. At his confirmation hearing, he stated he would focus on the U.S. supporting more access to cheaper energy — including geothermal, nuclear, oil and gas.

Some critics worry the Trump administration is rolling back plans to reduce pollution across the U.S. and efforts to support cleaner energies.

U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said the lab should continue its groundbreaking work in pushing for affordable and net-zero energy under its new name.

“President Trump’s ‘Drill Baby Drill’ slogan will never solve our nation’s most complex energy challenges,” Bennet said in a statement. “Instead, we must pursue innovation so America’s energy economy continues to compete effectively in the world and ultimately leads the global energy transition.”

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE LAB

The laboratory is a major economic generator in Colorado and had a $1.9 billion economic impact in the fiscal year 2023, according to a report released last year by the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The laboratory is one of the top five employers of Jefferson County, though it has been hit by federal cuts during the Trump administration that led to the lab eliminating 114 jobs earlier this year.

Since the lab was founded, CU Boulder’s report showed the U.S. continues to rely on natural gas and crude oil. Colorado saw “substantial growth” in renewable energy consumption between 2005 and 2022. The use of coal, which used to be a top source of energy alongside natural gas, fell 57% nationally and 40% in Colorado from 2007 to 2022.

Since then, the report said, coal is consumed about as much as renewable energies are.

HISTORY OF THE NREL

It’s not the first time the lab has been renamed. It was originally called the Solar Energy Research Institute when it opened in 1977.

The lab was created in response to the energy crisis sparked after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of oil and Saudi Arabia cut off all oil exports to the U.S.

In 1974, President Gerald Ford established the Energy Research and Development Administration — which was later replaced by the Department of Energy — and the Solar Energy Research Institute to invest in an alternative to oil.

It took several more years before it opened in Golden.

As the lab’s research expanded to other energy sources beyond solar, Republican President George H.W. Bush renamed it the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to reflect its growing range and designated the site as an official national lab.

“For decades, this laboratory and its scientific capabilities have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible and delivered impact to the nation,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director of the now-named National Laboratory of the Rockies, in the announcement.

Virden said the lab’s new name “embraces a broader applied energy mission entrusted to us by the Department of Energy to deliver a more affordable and secure energy future for all.”",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/226a_x046_4b9f_9-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 02:00:08.884679

About Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike Duke Energy customer rate increases would begin Jan. 1, 2027, with a second increase the next year, if approved by the utilities commission.
From 2027 to 2028, commercial customers for Duke Energy Carolinas will see increases of 8.7% and 3.9%.","State Attorney General Jeff Jackson said late Tuesday that he is intervening in Duke Energy’s proposed 15% customer rate hike and reviewing it to “ensure it is necessary.”

Two hours later, Gov. Josh Stein said he too is opposed to the increase, citing family affordability issues.

Less than two weeks ago, the Charlotte-based utility giant filed a revised rate request for 15% over two years with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Duke Energy said demand for electric power is rising at an unprecedented pace, and critical grid upgrades are needed for reliability, to protect against severe weather and to support North Carolina’s continued growth.

The filing would affect both Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress customers, covering much of the state. Combined the company has more than 4.5 million customers in North Carolina and South Carolina.

Duke Energy has said the proposed rate hikes will increase reliability through power grid updates for the growing state, including new businesses that are mainly manufacturing facilities. More electricity-hungry data centers also are expanding in the Carolinas, fueled by the boom in AI that requires lots of power.

“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”

Jackson’s office sent a news release to reporters about the move with the message header: “Attorney General Jeff Jackson Intervenes to Fight Duke Energy Rate Increases.”

The issue of affordability is one that continues to resonate nationally as well as locally, with politicians on both sides of the aisle seeking to claim the mantle of helping consumers.

Stein thanked Jackson for intervening. In a news release, the governor added, “Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike is simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy.

“At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less,” Stein said.

When asked to comment on Jackson’s and Stein’s statements, Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton told The Charlotte Observer: “We do not take any requests to increase rates lightly, knowing that our investments to meet North Carolina’s growing energy needs will be carefully evaluated by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the public, and interveners such as customer advocates and the attorney general.

“We look forward to continuing the constructive dialog of all parties as the review moves forward next year,” Norton said.

Jackson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

Duke Energy Carolinas serves the western half of the state, including Charlotte. Duke Energy Progress operates in the eastern half, including the Triangle region.

About Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike

Duke Energy customer rate increases would begin Jan. 1, 2027, with a second increase the next year, if approved by the utilities commission.

For Duke Energy Carolinas customers, the monthly bill would increase by $17.22 in 2027 and by $6.34 in 2028. In the first year, that would take average bills from $144.98 to $162.20. In 2028, the average monthly bill would be $168.54

For Duke Energy Progress customers, bills would increase by $23.11 in 2027 and by $6.59 in 2028. That would take the monthly bill in the first year from $163.84 to $186.95. In 2028, the average monthly bill would be $193.54.

Commercial and industrial customers would also experience rate increases.

From 2027 to 2028, commercial customers for Duke Energy Carolinas will see increases of 8.7% and 3.9%. Industrial customers will see 6.3% and 3.4%. On the Progress side, commercial hikes will be about 9.2% and 4.6%. Industrial will be around 7.4% and 4.3%.

The utility commission’s decision is expected in late 2026 following public hearings.

Critical minerals also get priority treatment when it comes to land use and permitting decisions, including on national public lands.
During the Biden administration, the FAST-41 program was expanded to include critical minerals projects, using the USGS list to determine eligibility.","On November 7, 2025, the Trump administration published its updated list of critical minerals. This update added ten new minerals to the U.S. Geological Survey’s critical minerals list, including copper, uranium, silver, and metallurgical coal. The inclusion of these minerals on the list for the first time makes it clear that the Trump administration is using the list to advance its agenda of prioritizing resource extraction over all other uses of our national public lands. Designating these minerals as ‘critical’ paves the way for land use and permitting decisions that will negatively impact Western public lands and wildlife habitats for decades to come.

What is the critical minerals list and why does it matter?

The Energy Act of 2020 defined critical minerals and specified a process and criteria for the U.S. Geological Survey (part of the Interior department) to develop and update the official critical minerals list. The law states that to be considered critical, a mineral must be essential to U.S. economic or national security, have a supply chain vulnerable to disruption, and be essential to manufacturing a product that is important to economic or national security. The law also specifically states that fuel minerals are not eligible for inclusion on the list. The list must be updated at least every three years, and the Trump administration has pledged to update it at least every two years. (In addition to Interior’s critical minerals list, the U.S. Department of Energy also maintains a critical materials list, which includes the critical minerals as well as additional materials that are vulnerable to supply chain disruption and essential to energy technologies specifically.)

Once a mineral is designated as critical, it can qualify for heightened consideration in areas such as U.S. defense and trade policy. Projects involving critical minerals can qualify for federal funding opportunities such as research and development grants, priority funding for mapping, and Defense Production Act investments. Critical minerals also get priority treatment when it comes to land use and permitting decisions, including on national public lands. In particular, critical minerals mining and processing projects are eligible for the “FAST-41” program. This program, so called because it was created by Section 41 of the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, was originally established during the Obama administration to streamline permitting for infrastructure projects.

During the Biden administration, the FAST-41 program was expanded to include critical minerals projects, using the USGS list to determine eligibility. The Biden administration permitted two critical minerals projects—the South32 Hermosa mine in Arizona and the Stibnite mine in Idaho—through the FAST-41 program. The Trump administration has since added several more mining projects to the program. The expansion of FAST-41 beyond what Congress intended in order to include mining projects is concerning. Mining on national public lands is governed by the Mining Law of 1872, which predates the nation’s environmental laws. The Mining Law grants sweeping rights to claim-holders; once established, these rights can last for decades and prevent other uses of public lands. The impacts of mining also can last for decades, and can damage drinking water sources, wildlife habitats, and other irreplaceable natural resources. This makes mining unlike transportation infrastructure and unsuited for a program intended to streamline infrastructure development in already-impacted and developed areas of the country. The mine permitting process is often the only opportunity the government and the public have to protect public lands and the species and communities that depend on them from the negative impacts of mines, such as pollution, water usage, loss of recreation access, and habitat damage. Speeding up this process limits these opportunities to balance multiple uses of our national public lands and threatens these resources we all depend on.

What’s new in the latest update?

The 2025 critical minerals list adds ten materials not previously included. Notable among the additions: copper, uranium, and coal.

Copper, often in the form of wires, is essential to many forms of technology. Its inclusion on the critical minerals list is inappropriate because the U.S. already has significant stockpiles of copper. However, designating copper as critical could help speed up permitting for domestic copper mining projects, such as the Resolution copper mine at Oak Flat in Arizona on land sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe.

The addition of uranium is even more inappropriate since the Energy Act of 2020 specifies that fuel minerals may not be included on the critical minerals list. (Uranium is the fuel for nuclear reactors.) To justify adding uranium, the USGS pointed to President Donald Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, signed January 20, 2025, which directed USGS to consider whether uranium could be included on the list. As with copper, designating uranium as critical is likely intended to help boost domestic uranium mining, which in turn would support an expansion of nuclear power in the U.S. A handful of uranium projects, including the Velvet Wood mine near Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and the Pinyon Plain mine near the Grand Canyon in Arizona, are already moving forward. Velvet Wood is especially notable because it was touted by the Interior department as the first project to be permitted under a new fast-tracked Interior department process that compresses environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act to a mere 14 days. (This is separate from FAST-41, which expedites permitting.)

Perhaps the biggest stretch is the addition of coal to the critical minerals list. As with uranium, coal should be ineligible for inclusion since it is a fuel mineral, and the law that established the critical minerals list specifically excludes fuel minerals from the list. Rather than follow the law, the USGS relied on a Trump executive order, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” signed April 8, 2025, which directed USGS to consider adding metallurgical coal to the critical minerals list. There are several different types of coal, and metallurgical coal is the type that is suitable for use in steel production. (Thermal coal, also referred to as steam coal, is the type that is used in power plants. While metallurgical coal can also be used in power plants, it is usually more expensive. Thermal coal cannot be used in steel production.) Designating metallurgical coal as critical could help bolster both metallurgical coal mining and a domestic market for metallurgical coal in the U.S. by making projects that use metallurgical coal eligible for federal funding opportunities and expedited permitting. (Currently, the majority of metallurgical coal mined in the U.S. is exported.) However, it is also another example of disregard for the law, which states that fuel minerals may not be designated as critical, to advance the Trump administration’s political agenda of propping up the dying coal industry.

What does this mean for public lands in the West?

President Trump’s “energy emergency,” his executive order to increase domestic mineral production, and the addition of copper, uranium, and coal to the critical minerals list present serious threats to national public lands, outdoor recreation access, and wildlife habitats in the West. The Trump administration’s policies are designed to prioritize mineral production over all other uses of national public lands. These policies have already resulted in the resurrection of zombie mines, such as the Velvet Wood mine, and disregard for Tribal sacred sites, such as the Resolution copper project at Oak Flat in Arizona. Many more projects are already being fast-tracked, guaranteeing more damage to public lands and wildlife habitats in the years to come. Even when mining ceases, the impacts of these projects will be felt for decades into the future, as the West has already seen over the past century.",https://westernpriorities.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25134706586_9df777fb6b_k.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:58:38.087611

Adam Remnant, director of arts education for Stuart’s, said acoustic treatment makes it easier for students to hear what is being played.","Giving Tuesday is a day for those all over the world, including Ohio University Bobcats, to share their generosity and support for those in the community.

Multiple organizations and non-profits encourage the public to donate and support various causes. This year, Bobcats have the opportunity to support the environment and local students through Giving Tuesday fundraisers.

At Jackie O’s Taproom, located at 25 Campbell St., residents and students are invited to Pints with a Purpose, hosted by Stuart’s Opera House in support of its after school music and audio program. The music program was implemented for students in the area in need of an artistic outlet to share their love of music and performance.

Juno Beard, assistant director of arts education for Stuart’s, said the opera house is supporting about 65 students this year and 11 bands.

Beard said with an increase in demand for students wishing to join the music program, there is a limited amount of space, meaning several students work as the bands practice around them.

Beard also said the rooms are large and create an echo, which might affect the songwriting process.

“So when you have really loud amps or drums (and) students trying to play their song or get the full experience of their song, it can be really difficult to hear,” Beard said.

To combat this issue, Tuesday’s event is raising money for acoustic treatment for Stuart’s practice and recording rooms. Acoustic treatment, the process of improving sound quality in a space, ensures sound waves are reflected correctly, according to Audiophiles. Adam Remnant, director of arts education for Stuart’s, said acoustic treatment makes it easier for students to hear what is being played.

“It makes it so that music and sound isn't bouncing off the surfaces of the walls and ceiling and floor as much, which just makes it a more conducive listening environment,” Remnant said. “Which will benefit the students, will benefit the staff. It'll just make everything sound better.”

From every featured pint of beer from Jackie O’s, $1 is donated to Stuart’s and guests have additional opportunities throughout the night to donate directly to their fund.

Evan Seurkamp, AMP alum and instructor and member of the Laughing Chimes band, is performing, followed by Carter Tinkham, current AMP student, a solo performer and songwriter with a country adjacent sound. Beard and Remnant are also performing in their band Shirt Brothers.

“We are going to play a couple of original songs and maybe one cover,” Beard said. “It’ll be short … but just an extra thing to make it a fun evening and encourage people to get out and donate for Giving Tuesday.”

Locals can also give back Tuesday by supporting the Athens Conservancy, a non-profit land trust protecting wild land and biodiversity in the environment. The Conservancy strives to protect its 3,200 acres of land, and have partnered with the city and county to protect 300 acres of public land.

The non-profit had $5,032,824 in assets at the end of 2021, with $273,974 from contributions and grants. It is matching all donations dollar for dollar to its Bluebell fund. Dollars raised helps pay for university student’s summer internships, guided hikes, outreach programs, land acquisition and stewardship and invasive-plant removal.

Kate Kelley, president of the Conservancy, said donations will help acquire land from owners who want to protect the natural environment on their property. Kelley said the Conservancy focuses on protecting watersheds and forested areas because they are important for public health and carbon sequestration, the long-term storage of carbon in plants, soils, geologic formations and the ocean.

“(Carbon sequestration) is very important for buffering the effects of climate change,” Kelley said.

Kelley highlighted the importance and impact the Conservancy’s interns have, and said they make a positive impact in their local areas. Kelley said engaging young minds makes a difference and it is essential to have the funds to support them.

“People out of town can visit and feel what it feels like to be in a mature forest,” Kelley said. “You can see the use of your dollars in terms of carbon sequestration, and you can go out and enjoy it. It's not something far away that you'll never see, you'll never enjoy. This is right here, and everyone has access to our preserves.”

CSI Solar, established in 2009 in China as a subsidiary by Canadian solar, is based in Suzhou, China. The corporate restructuring follows stringent pushbacks against Chinese owned firms in the US market.

Canadian Solar will own 75.1 percent of each JV, which will run the solar manufacturing assets through a leasing model. For Canadian Solar, founded by Chinese origin Dr. Shawn Qu, the perception battle has been an ongoing effort, with many assuming that the firm is a Chinese firm, when it is clearly not. The latest move goes further to derisk the firm's operations from action against Chinese owned firms in the US.

The three facilities to be part of the JV are a solar wafer plant, a battery factory, and an energy storage manufacturing site that is still under construction.

The China listed CSI will receive a one-time payment of CNY352 million (USD49.8 million) based on an asset valuation of CNY469 million. Post deal, CSI will focus on non-US markets exclusively.

CSI also plans to provide Canadian Solar with a counter-guarantee limit of upto CNY44.6 billion (USD6.3 billion) to support the latter in providing performance and financing guarantees for CSI and its holding subsidiaries. CSI was listed on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2023, at the height of the boom in solar stocks in China, which has subsequently ebbed after the downturn caused by over capacity and low prices.

CSI's history in the US market is quite interesting in itself, as it entered the US market in 2015 by acquiring local PV power plant developer Recurrent Energy.

TVA, the nation's largest government-owned utility, reapplied for the $800 million funding opportunity in April after President Donald Trump's administration revised the grant criteria to remove diversity, equity and inclusion requirements in the original grant announced under former President Joe Biden's administration. TVA and its partners originally applied in January.

The two recipients of $400 million each, TVA and Holtec Government Services, were announced Tuesday.

TVA plans to build a 300-megawatt reactor designed by GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy by 2032. The TVA board of directors approved $350 million for the project before losing its quorum in April after Trump fired two of its members.

TVA led a team of partners to apply for the grant funding, including Bechtel, BWX Technologies and the state of Tennessee. The funding is meant to assist companies working to build the next generation of nuclear reactors, which the Trump administration has tied to artificial intelligence leadership.

The TVA reactors could be the first small modular reactors in the U.S. In May, the federal utility became the first power company to apply for a construction permit for a small modular reactor. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission could approve construction by the end of 2026.

Small modular reactors are designed to be smaller, safer and more financially feasible than large, traditional nuclear power plants.

The first TVA reactor in Oak Ridge will cost around $5.4 billion to build, according to a draft of the utility's long-term energy plan. The cost would go down with each new reactor, TVA officials have said.

""This award affirms TVA's continued leadership in shaping the nation's nuclear energy future,"" Don Moul, TVA president and CEO, said in a press release. ""With (the Department of Energy's) support and the strength of our partners, we're accelerating the deployment of next-generation nuclear -- reducing financial risk to consumers and strengthening U.S. energy security. This is how we deliver reliable, affordable energy and real opportunity for American families.""

CELEBRATING AWARD

The grant is a critical source of funding for the self-funded utility, which operates under a legal debt limit of $30 billion, set by Congress in 1979 and never adjusted for inflation. TVA ended its fiscal year Sept. 30 with $23.8 billion of debt.

TVA generated a record $13.7 billion in revenue in 2025, with $1.4 billion in net income after expenses. The utility is building more than 3,500 megawatts of new power generation, enough for more than 2 million homes, mostly from natural gas plants.

Holtec, the other grant recipient, plans to build two reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan. Both projects use Generation III nuclear technologies, which have similar designs to existing nuclear plants.

Three traditional nuclear plants supply around 40% of TVA's power, which is used by more than 10 million people in seven Southern states. TVA is headquartered in Knoxville and maintains its largest operations and employee base in Chattanooga.

The federal award, approved by Congress in 2024, was celebrated by members of Congress on Tuesday.

""TVA and East Tennessee are primed to spearhead the deployment of next-generation (small modular reactors) that will fundamentally change America's energy future,"" U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Ooltewah, said in a press release. ""I commend TVA, (the Department of Energy) and the Trump White House for their work in making today's announcement a reality.""

U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, have criticized TVA's board for what they claimed was a slow, bureaucratic approach to nuclear technology. The pair pushed the Trump administration to select a new board shortly before Trump fired the first of three terminated Biden appointees in March.

""I look forward to seeing Tennessee play a central role in shaping the future of nuclear power for the country,"" Hagerty said in a press release Tuesday.

Since moving to Asheville in 2004, Judy Mattox has been on a mission to protect the mountains of Western North Carolina. “Asheville is just ‘take-your-heart,’” she says. A lover of hiking and gardening, Mattox decided to increase her knowledge of the natural world and how to care for it by joining the local chapter of the Sierra Club in 2007. In 2010, she was voted WNC Sierra Club chair. “I do the little piece that I can do, although sometimes, it’s not that little.”

Mattox explains that the Sierra Club has a multitude of goals for WNC, centering around protecting natural resources, fighting the effects of climate change, and educating the public on how they can get involved. She goes on to say that a large portion of their work revolves around local politics. “Our main bottom line is to affect elections, to affect good environmental candidates to safeguard the state,” Mattox says, stating that the Sierra Club endorses the environmentally-minded candidates across the entire NC ticket, and makes sure the voters are informed on who those candidates are. In the last election, the club handed out over 40,000 endorsement cards to voters. “We have the ear of a lot of people. They’re turning to us, going, ‘Who do we vote for?’”

The WNC Sierra Club has tackled a wide variety of environmentally-related issues. In 2020, they helped to shut down the Duke Energy coal-fueled power plant at Lake Julian. Along with partner Southern Environmental Law, they fought to establish zoning laws and ordinances for steep slope developments to prevent runoff into the river, and to protect farmland from being bought out by big developers. They also helped to pass dark sky ordinances to reduce light pollution and protect the migrating birds, as well as noise ordinances to ban crypto-mining (which she says can create jet engine level noise) in WNC. Currently, they are championing the cause Plastic-Free WNC to outlaw single-use plastics. On the first Wednesday of every month, the club holds a public program covering a range of topics from Reducing Your Carbon Footprint to Birding and Wildflowers. “There’s never any lack of things to be involved with,” Mattox says of the club’s many good works. “I haven’t slept well in fourteen years.”

A recent WNC Sierra Club accomplishment that Mattox is particularly proud of is joining with high school students across Buncombe County to petition the county to approve a goal to have 100% renewable energy by 2042. In December 2017, based on the students’ testimonies, the county changed their vote and passed the resolution. “Kids are powerful,” Mattox remarks. She goes on to say that the WNC Sierra Club’s award-winning Kids Adventure Club starts early in educating children to appreciate the natural world around them. The club takes young people on hikes and trips to the NC Arboretum, and hosts kids’ programs on birds, trees and snakes. “You gotta teach kids to love nature. They’re the best reason of all to get involved.”

When Hurricane Helene hit WNC last year, the WNC Sierra Club was needed even more. They partnered with MountainTrue, RiverLink, and Asheville GreenWorks, to repair the local ecosystem with efforts like live-staking the eroded stream beds, and giving away free trees to plant. They also helped educate the public about what effects the storm actually had on the trees and forests. Mattox comments that the people who live in Asheville feel that it is their duty to protect its natural resources, and that it has one of the largest number of environmental groups in the country. “Pretty much everywhere I go, everybody I meet wants to protect our mountains, wants clean air and clean water,” she says, commenting on how rewarding it has been to see their club’s meeting attendance grow in the past few years. “We have 1.1 million acres of forest surrounding us, which is why a lot of us are here; it’s beautiful.”

In 2024, Mattox and the club’s political chair Ken Brame were awarded the Environmental Champion of the Year by the WNC Rotary Club. She also received an award in 2020 for the Adventure Club program. Mattox says that her favorite aspect of her work as club chair is that she gets to bring all of these different groups together to talk about the best options for the environment, and that she hopes her own charm, humor and directness serve her role well. “It’s really fun when things are successful,” Mattox says. “All of this takes forever, so you just keep trying, keep trying.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-02 19:02:08.697084

“But undoing Biden’s radical and reckless policies takes time, and I appreciate Alabama Power’s responsiveness to the Public Service Commission’s immediate and primary objective: providing much-needed relief to Alabama families and ratepayers.
Brent Woodall, who is challenging Beeker in the 2026 Republican primary, told 1819 News the action was an example of “the tail wagging the dog.” “Why is the Public Service Commission not the one who is laying out what needs to happen?
That is something that the Public Service Commission is supposed to be providing leadership on and in this case it seems like the tail is wagging the dog,” Woodall said.
I’m sure they’re looking at Georgia and it’s giving them some concern, but again the Public Service Commission we need people that are leading the way, not following.","Members of the Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) approved on Tuesday a two-year rate freeze proposed by Alabama Power in a recent filing.

The PSC regulates utility companies in Alabama.

Commissioner Jeremy Oden said in a statement after the vote on Tuesday, ""The high cost of living is hurting the quality of life of every Alabamian, and Alabama Power’s commitment to keep rates flat for two years is a win for ratepayers.”

“Biden’s war on American energy is over, and President Trump is ushering in the golden age of American energy dominance,” he added. “But undoing Biden’s radical and reckless policies takes time, and I appreciate Alabama Power’s responsiveness to the Public Service Commission’s immediate and primary objective: providing much-needed relief to Alabama families and ratepayers. I’m proud of the work my fellow commissioners and I put into bringing everyone to the table and pushing for real, practical solutions that make energy more affordable.""

Commissioner Chris Beeker said, “Alabama Power’s announcement that it will seek to keep utility rates flat for the next two years brings welcome relief at a time when all of us are struggling with the inflation hangover created by the Biden administration and woke initiatives like the Green New Deal.”

“Every member of the Public Service Commission sent strong signals that any request for a rate increase would be a non-starter because too many families across Alabama are already finding it difficult to make ends meet, and consumers need relief,” he continued. “We appreciate the fact that our message was received, understood, and accommodated. During his first term in office, President Trump built the greatest, strongest, and most successful economy in our nation’s history, and as a proud MAGA Republican, I know he will repair the economic damage Biden left behind, restore affordability to our everyday lives, and make America great again. At the same time, I’ll stand shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump to stop committed communists and socialists like AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Zohran Mamdani from destroying the capitalist system that built the greatest nation history has ever known.""

Brent Woodall, who is challenging Beeker in the 2026 Republican primary, told 1819 News the action was an example of “the tail wagging the dog.”

“Why is the Public Service Commission not the one who is laying out what needs to happen? Why is it that the utilities are going to the PSC, saying ‘Here’s what we’ll do’ in response to these reports and also I think to Sen. (Katie) Britt’s comments about high rates that Alabamians pay. That is something that the Public Service Commission is supposed to be providing leadership on and in this case it seems like the tail is wagging the dog,” Woodall said. “I’m sure that they’ve got concerns about what is coming. You mentioned Georgia. That’s two (PSC) seats that flipped to the Democrat Party. They’ve got to be looking from Georgia to Alabama, saying ‘Well, what’s going to take place here?’”

He continued, ""It goes back to: why do we have the difference in rates between Georgia and Alabama? WBRC reported that Alabama has the third-highest electric bills in the nation behind Hawaii and Connecticut. With that being the case, why would our rates be that high compared to Georgia and the other southern states? The answer that you receive from the Public Service Commission quite frequently when you ask those questions is, ‘Well, it gets hot in Alabama.’ Well, it gets hot in Georgia and Mississippi and Louisiana and Florida. I’m sure they’re looking at Georgia and it’s giving them some concern, but again the Public Service Commission we need people that are leading the way, not following.

“I think the people of Alabama are going to see this vote for what it is. It is an act being carried out by the commissioners because they are concerned about their position. I don’t think that they are going to be successful in what they are trying to do which is keep Alabamians from realizing just what a poor job the commissioners have been doing over the last several years,"" Woodall said.

Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry, who is challenging Oden in the Republican primary in 2026, told 1819 News on Tuesday, “It’s ironic that the timing is five months before the election that’s coming up.”

“When you’re in a position like the Public Service Commission…it’s your job to take care of the citizens, it’s your job to take care of the businesses and make sure that there’s balance for them to be successful. It’s your job to work hand in hand for economic development (and) growth but also make sure that our citizens are taken care of and it’s your job to be a voice for them,” Gentry said.

Grassroots programs left hanging For Solar United Neighbors, the Solar for All cut stopped years of work mid-stride.

Most participants pay or finance systems on their own, but Solar for All funding was poised to reach families without the upfront capital.
The nonprofit was preparing to deliver residential solar across the Northern Plains — projects designed to reduce bills and build energy sovereignty.","The Trump Administration sought “energy dominance” in 2025 — and dominate they did. Reminiscent of the president’s WWE days, the administration put the solar industry in a series of submission holds: tariffs, FEOC rules, tax credit tweaks, new oversight from the Department of Interior — all aimed at slowing the post-IRA renewable boom.

The quickest TKO came from EPA head Lee Zeldin, who canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program in a social media video — cutting off funding that would have expanded solar access for low-income households across the country.

But the fight over that funding isn’t over. It is escalating.

By god — that’s … that’s the Southern Environmental Law Center’s music!

The SELC started the official rematch by filing a federal lawsuit in October, joined by Lawyers for Good Government, the Conservation Law Foundation, and the Lawyers Committee for Rhode Island, to reverse what they call the administration’s “illegal termination” of the program. The government has 60 days to respond to the filing (Dec. 5 at the latest).

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All,” said SELC Senior Attorney Nick Torrey. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

Then came the states. Attorneys general from 22 states — plus D.C., Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin’s economic development agency — have filed their own lawsuits to force the EPA to reinstate the money. Their filings argue the agency “has no lawful authority” to de-obligate funds Congress already awarded and obligated under the IRA.

Adding to the pressure, 32 U.S. senators (30 Democrats and two independents) sent a joint letter to Zeldin demanding reinstatement:

“Your agency’s decision to terminate Solar for All is not only unlawful — given this funding was congressionally appropriated and fully obligated — but also ill-timed… Solar for All will save Americans an estimated $350 million annually on their energy bills at a time when working families need it most.”

The senators warned the cancellation is already disrupting workforce training underway in West Virginia, Alaska and across the Midwest, and pressed EPA for a full accounting of how it plans to repair what they describe as a breach of trust.

As this political brawl spills from social feeds into federal courtrooms, we’re keeping the spotlight where it belongs — on the communities and contractors left waiting.

The stakes

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 34 million American households are energy insecure, often forced to choose between electricity and other basic needs.

The 60 programs tied to Solar for All funding would have given 1 million homes access to solar power, according to the Clean Energy States Alliance, and provided more than $400 million in savings annually for decades to come.

That’s a modest start given the scale of energy insecurity — but a meaningful one, since those benefits would compound every year through lower bills, local jobs, and community ownership.

Anya Schoolman, executive director of Solar United Neighbors (SUN), estimated Solar for All would “slash household electricity costs by 20 percent, lowering electricity bills for each household by roughly $400 each year.”

The funding was spread across the map.

“Appalachian communities have been hard hit by the downturn of the coal industry and rising electric bills. Solar for All is a practical program that could create real relief for households across the region,” said Dana Kuhnline, program director at ReImagine Appalachia.

The Solar for All program had granted $637 million to projects in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, plus another $811 million in multi-state initiatives. Kuhnline estimates that canceling those awards “undermines good work for more than 6,000 Appalachians over four years, and prevents solar installations for 150,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities.” Those projects, she added, “would have saved Appalachia’s low-income households more than $70 million on their utility bills.”

In Georgia, the funding expanded the Georgia BRIGHT program, which offers no-cost solar to about 900 low-income households statewide. Nearly 500 households signed up within 24 hours of the launch. Additional lease and community solar programs were in the works.

Grassroots programs left hanging

For Solar United Neighbors, the Solar for All cut stopped years of work mid-stride.

SUN, a nonprofit that organizes bulk-purchase solar programs, has helped more than 11,000 families install 92 MW of rooftop solar since 2007. Most participants pay or finance systems on their own, but Solar for All funding was poised to reach families without the upfront capital.

“Scale is what makes this model work,” says Ben Delman, editorial director of SUN. “Solar for All lowers the cost of solar for everybody — and lowers everybody’s energy bills — because we’re putting so much more clean electricity back on the grid.”

With that funding, SUN expected to help 6,000 families go solar in Florida, with additional projects in Texas and Indiana. Each program was tailored to local needs: some focused on single-family homes, others on community solar or multifamily housing.

In Houston, SUN was developing “Hub Homes” — resiliency centers with solar and batteries. “If the power goes out, those homes can open their doors to neighbors to charge phones, stay cool, or power medical equipment,” Delman said. “That’s the kind of locally driven design Solar for All made possible.”

Each project was also structured for long-term support, with maintenance contracts built in and opportunities for local workforce participation. All of it — from the Houston Hub Homes to the early outreach in Florida — is now on hold.

Tribal energy sovereignty on pause

For groups like GRID Alternatives, the nation’s largest nonprofit solar installer, the losses are measured in real numbers: tens of thousands of low-income households, hundreds of millions in bill savings, and thousands of job opportunities.

GRID had already begun preparing its first Solar for All ribbon-cutting, planned in Traverse City, Michigan, with Habitat for Humanity. That project, and dozens of sub-awards from other recipients eager to partner with GRID, are now indefinitely suspended.

By 2029, GRID’s two Solar for All programs — rescinded by the EPA at a value of nearly $330 million — were projected to serve 40,000 households, generate $541 million in savings, create 6,700 job-training opportunities, and avoid 3.4 million tons of CO₂ emissions.

The cuts hit Tribal programs particularly hard. Indigenized Energy, part of a coalition of 14 tribes awarded Solar for All funds, confirmed it has already made staff cuts and lost its opportunity to participate in a $135 million initiative through the Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition (TREC).

The nonprofit was preparing to deliver residential solar across the Northern Plains — projects designed to reduce bills and build energy sovereignty.

“This isn’t just about numbers on a spreadsheet,” said Cody Two Bears, founder and CEO of Indigenized Energy. “It’s about families who can’t afford their electricity bills, skilled workers in Indian Country who just lost their livelihoods, and a planet that desperately needs us to heal it. The true cost will be felt in homes, on our lands, and across our shared future.”

Bottom line: A breach of trust

Even if Congress or the courts restore the money, the damage may be done. We’re talking non-profits and small businesses. Many programs can’t survive long-term uncertainty.

“In Florida, for example, we’d already begun pre-qualifying folks,” Delman says. “To suddenly say, ‘Sorry, we’re not doing this anymore,’ is a big breach of trust — especially for communities that have been promised help before and seen it vanish.”

The sudden stop of Solar for All, through no fault of the participating organizations, risks deepening that skepticism.

“For your audience,” Delman adds, “we’re encouraging folks to reach out to their members of Congress. This money was appropriated. Congress holds the power of the purse — and this is a proven way to lower energy costs in their districts.”

But the damage goes beyond dollars. Solar for All wasn’t just about expanding access to new technology. It was about building a path forward for clean energy can serve everyone.

And once that trust is gone, no court order can flip the switch back on.

In the Netherlands, Alliander – the electricity and gas network operator serving 3.5 million customers – has adopted Siemens’ Gridscale X platform to support the energy transition. The software delivers real-time visibility via a digital twin of the grid, enabling up to a 30% increase in grid utilisation without new physical infrastructure. This added capacity is also allowing more renewable generation to come online.​

Data centres and cooling innovation

In Estonia, Greenergy Data Centers has rolled out Siemens’ White Space Cooling Optimization control system at its site near Tallinn.

The solution uses dense sensor networks to constantly track temperature and airflow, automatically fine-tuning cooling equipment to actual demand.

“When we first launched the system, it improved our efficiency by approximately 30% at the push of a button,” Kert Evert, Chief Development Officer at Greenergy Data Centers, says.

“But this was just the beginning, because the system learns, adapts and improves over time.”

Beyond boosting efficiency, AI is helping to advance circularity and resource productivity. Around 60% of organisations are using AI for resource efficiency management, while 43% apply it to improve waste handling. At the same time, predictive maintenance solutions designed to extend asset life and cut material use have been adopted by 60% of organisations.​

AI for circular product design

At the product level, AI is enabling sustainability criteria to be built into design workflows from day one. Some 63% of organisations report using generative design for physical products, helping teams optimise for material use and embedded carbon at the outset.

Eryn Devola, Head of Sustainability at Digital Industries, a division within Siemens, says AI tools are making sustainable design practical without overwhelming engineering teams.

“It’s now easier to say, ‘While we’re working on this design, let’s also address resource efficiency and carbon footprint.’

“Today, we can model these factors and embed them into decision-making to achieve the right trade-offs without adding major effort for engineering.

“And we can go further: since we’re already touching the design, we should also explore how to dematerialise, reduce size, increase modularity, etc.

“These are all key factors that contribute to creating a truly sustainable product for the long term,” she says.

Lighter robotics and cleaner glass

Siemens has showcased these capabilities with lightweight robot grippers produced from a lower-carbon polymer. The grippers weigh under 2kg and account for just 30kg of CO₂ emissions from cradle to gate, versus 670kg for traditional metal grippers weighing close to 50kg. According to the company, upgraded production lines using these components have cut energy use by around half and reduced CO₂ emissions by more than three tonnes.​

Automation Innovation, a specialist in glass production equipment, has also applied AI-powered analytics and digital twin technology to overhaul mould cleaning. The new automated system has saved 700,000 tons of raw materials annually, trimmed on-site energy demand by 30% and avoided nearly one billion kilograms of CO₂ emissions so far, while eliminating the need for hazardous cleaning chemicals.​

Rising confidence in AI’s impact

Confidence in industrial AI as a lever for the energy transition is rising sharply. The share of respondents expecting a high or medium positive impact on accelerating the energy transition climbed from 42% in 2024 to 71% in 2025. Separately, 59% say they are already using AI to help decarbonise operations, according to the Siemens Infrastructure Transition Monitor 2025.​

Brooke Tvermoes, Director of Climate, Energy and Environment at IBM’s Chief Sustainability Office, says: “We implemented AI in our manufacturing operations and the focus was actually to help improve product quality and yield.

“But by doing that we also reduced waste and energy consumption. That’s a tangible result with real dollar values associated with it, which resonates with people.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f96bd8e5eebe9be636445d38497c295d:65e74f160662555d4c2dda13a5b9a266/eva-riesenhuber-global-head-of-sustainability-at-siemens.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 21:58:52.524277

The Trump administration also will back the Tennessee Valley Authority with $400 million to advance the deployment of a small modular reactor in Tennessee and to accelerate the addition of more units.

Jupiter, Florida-based Holtec has targeted a mid-2030 commissioning date for the novel reactors in Van Buren County's Covert Township. They would have a capacity of up to 300 megawatts per unit, which is about a third of what a traditional reactor produces. They are a tenth to a quarter of the size and are modular, meaning they can be made in a factory and installed on site and are less expensive.

Holtec called the DOE's announcement a ""major step forward.""

Just look at any automaker's sales report following the credit's expiration, and the impact was clear.

Despite this, Hyundai is not backing down from its electrification strategy, which currently includes hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and will soon expand to include extended-range electric vehicles.

""Our EV strategy was never based on current policy because then you just have a timer until the next administration. We were building an EV plant and had an E-GMP platform prior to the IRA. And we will obviously work with whoever's in the administration to comply with whatever regulations there are at that time.""

– Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy for Hyundai Motor North America

CarBuzz spoke with Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy for Hyundai Motor North America, at the 2025 Los Angeles Auto Show. We learned how the South Korean automaker currently sees itself in a major consumer shift with regard to who wants a new EV. This shift may require new products, new powertrains, and a rethink on how Hyundai prices its vehicles.

EV Sales Dropped Last Month, But Are Up Overall

You may undoubtedly read headlines about how EV sales are rapidly declining and almost no one is buying them anymore. We encourage you to read deeper and use critical thinking skills, as these headlines may be intentionally misleading to get your click. Glancing at Hyundai's sales report for November 2025, EV sales were indeed down compared to the same month in 2024. The 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 5 saw a 59% drop from last year, while the Ioniq 6 fell by 56%. There was not enough data for the Ioniq 9 in October 2024, and the Kona Electric is not separated from the gas model in Hyundai's sales report.

Seeing those huge negative changes compared to 2024 may seem like it spells doom for EV sales, but the numbers are already starting to level out. In fact, the November sales are up from October when the Ioniq 5 sold 1,642 units and the Ioniq 6 only moved 398 units; the Ioniq 9 remained relatively steady from last month's 317-unit pace. It's also important to look at the year-to-date sales, where the Ioniq 5 is up 12% compared to 2024 and, despite a rapidly slowing sedan market, the Ioniq 6 is down just 9%. EV sales overall are not growing as fast as they were previously, but they are not yet in decline.

Hyundai Was Ready Without The Credit

Hyundai was among the automakers most ready for the $7,500 tax credit to expire, as the Korean automaker almost immediately announced massive price cuts on its popular Ioniq 5 EV. Depending on the trim, the difference actually surpassed the amount you would have been given by the federal government (up to $9,800). This move was done intentionally to help cater to a new audience of EV buyers.

""Early EV consumers were new adopters, and now we've moved to the center of the (innovation adoption) curve. That middle of the curve is people who prioritize affordability and ease of use. We need to make sure EVs cater to them,"" Boyle explained. ""We look at it in advance and say, 'this is what the customer wants, but they will only want to pay this much in four or five years.' So we work internally with R&D to say the material cost is commonized in advance such that we can offer it at that price or readjust the options in our car.""

Even with a nearly $10,000 discount on the Ioniq 5, Boyle admits she knew October sales would not match Hyundai's lofty September numbers before the federal tax credit expired. For reference, the Ioniq 5 sold 8,408 units in September (a 152% change compared to the same month in 2024), its best sales month ever. ""A lot of people just wanted to get the credit before it went away. There was encouragement even from senators and lawmakers,"" she added.

EREVs Solve The Infrastructure Issue?

After affordability, Boyle sees infrastructure as the next major hurdle to overcome on the road to EV adoption. More chargers are a clear solution, but Hyundai believes there are other short-term answers that fit consumer's needs. ""What we've done as a strategy is a diversity of powertrains and flexibility in manufacturing: ICE, HEV, and battery EV. And now also we're saying EREV,"" she said.

""It's not a consumer issue, it's an infrastructure systems issue. It's not that I don't like EVs, it's if the infrastructure was there. That was a pain point for the middle of the curve. So you need a strategy to accommodate the middle of the curve.""

""People like to hear 'I can have a 600-mile range.' You can get that with EREV. That is a big motivator, especially if you are driving something like a truck,"" Boyle described. ""They are just looking for that max range, maybe if it's 150 or 200 miles (on electric), you can go without charging two or three days. I think it becomes more of a proposition the higher you get that all-electric range.""

It's unclear which Hyundai product will be the first to receive an EREV powertrain, but Boyle may have given a hint during our interview.

""EV-only is a tough sell, especially in pickup trucks. You don't get 600 miles. We just announced a midsize truck. Give us time.""

While Hyundai works on changing its lineup, the company is also working on improving existing infrastructure with its partnership in Ionna, a North American charging network that will soon challenge Tesla Superchargers. Hyundai is one of seven automakers invested in Ionna, helping to build DC fast-chargers across the country.

""We've only been a company for about 20 months, but we've contracted 4,000 charging bases across the US, 1,000 just in California. We plan to have 1,000 charging bays live by the end of the year,"" said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna. ""Everything we are deploying is 400 kilowatt charging: 40% NACS and 60% CCS, but we watch the market, and we can see queuing if we need to go back and make changes.""",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-hyundai-palisade-grille.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 18:03:21.215831

Coalition of Pro-Environment Legislators and Advocates Call for Passage of the Energy Leadership Act Bill During Lame Duck

Environmental champions in the Legislature joined with advocates from across the state today to ask the Senate Budget Committee to advance historic clean energy legislation at its Dec. 8 hearing.

The New Jersey Energy Leadership Act would put New Jersey on the path to 100% clean electricity by 2035. This landmark legislation is designed to lower electricity costs and create union jobs by quickly bringing locally produced renewable energy online to respond to the growing energy affordability crisis.

“Last month’s election provided a clear mandate for bold action to lower energy prices,” said New Jersey LCV Executive Director, Ed Potosnak. “The New Jersey Energy Leadership Act will put our state at the forefront of lowering electricity prices for working families while creating union jobs in growing clean energy industries. This legislation is the centerpiece of Governor Murphy’s environmental legacy, and the time to act is now.”

The press conference came after months of thorough discussions between Governor Murphy, legislators and key stakeholders to create the strongest possible legislation that creates union jobs, strengthens environmental justice protections and addresses skyrocketing energy prices.

“The New Jersey Clean Energy Act of 2024 is a critical step toward lowering utility bills and making our energy system more affordable for every family in our state,” said Assemblyman Robert J. Karabinchak (D-Middlesex). “By expanding clean, reliable power, this bill will help to stabilize energy costs while cutting emissions. It also creates strong consumer protections and supports good-paying jobs as we transition to a cleaner grid. This is the kind of forward-looking policy New Jersey needs, one that protects both our environment and our wallets.”

""Clean energy is an environmental issue and a kitchen table budget issue. Energy demands are escalating fast. More than 50 data centers have been built or approved to be built in New Jersey with 100 more applications expected in the near future. While we grapple with how to address these new development pressures, these data centers are driving demand and prices. Clean energy is the fastest energy we can build and bring to market. Clean energy is also the least expensive type of energy for New Jersey residents and businesses,"" said Jennifer M. Coffey, Executive Director Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions (ANJEC). ""Offshore wind and solar energy are also the cleanest forms of energy and will help us meet our climate change goals, which are incredibly important in the fastest warming state in the nation here in New Jersey.""

“Making 100% clean energy the law in New Jersey is not just an essential climate goal—it’s an investment in healthier communities, stronger local economies, and long-term reliable and affordable energy,"" said Patty Cronheim of ReThink Energy NJ. ""By balancing environmental responsibility with smart innovation, we can ensure a sustainable future that benefits every resident across the state and generations to come.""

Trenton must lead on this issue more than ever in the face of dangerous environmental rollbacks from President Trump and his MAGA allies in Washington — which are causing energy costs to skyrocket to further enrich oil and gas billionaires.

“The goal of 100% Clean Energy by 2035 is achievable, when we have humane leadership that considers the future of our planet, and will host all of our descendants with a healthy earth, that has clean air, clean water, and clean soil,” said Sharonda Allen, MPA, Chapter Co-Chair, Greater New Jersey Gateway Chapter of the Climate Reality Project. “This can be achieved by sourcing our energy from clean, green energy such as Solar, and the re-ignition of Offshore Wind here in New Jersey! Our geography is well-suited for smart energy production that will produce jobs and help to lower electricity costs for all New Jerseyans.”

At the same time, November’s elections underscored a clear mandate from voters to lower energy costs by investing in clean, renewable energy. This legislation would ensure New Jersey has access to cleaner and cheaper energy that can be built much more quickly than dirty fossil fuels.

“The Energy Leadership Act is the legislature’s chance to deliver on energy affordability for New Jerseyans, and we need it to become law right now. Each day, working families are bearing an energy burden created by Big Tech and our grid operator, PJM. This landmark legislation would put our state on a path toward alleviating that burden by expanding large-scale, cheap, and fast, clean energy generation. We urge Speaker Coughlin and Senate President Scutari to do what is right for New Jerseyans by securing our clean energy progress, clean our air, and bring costs down by passing the Energy Leadership Act. We now urge Senator Sarlo to post S237 on the Senate Budget.” Anjuli Ramos-Busot, NJ Sierra Club Director

“New Jersey is known for innovation, and that pioneering spirit should carry into our push for cleaner, cutting-edge forms of energy that protect people’s health, safeguard our environment, and lower costs,” said Senator Angela McKnight (D- Hudson). “Clean energy is cheaper and faster to develop than fossil fuels, and it has the power to improve affordability for families while rapidly expanding our in-state generation. We must pass the Energy Leadership Act to meet the energy needs of our state, strengthen our grid, and secure a more sustainable future for the next generation.”

""New Jersey has the opportunity to lead the nation in building a clean energy future. As a proud sponsor of this legislation, I know that promoting 100% clean energy isn’t just about protecting our environment. It’s about protecting our communities, our economy, and the generations to come.” Said Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D- Essex and Passaic).

“This is a defining moment for our state. Climate change is not some far-off threat—we already feel its effects as it devastates our communities with more frequent storms, extreme heat, and rising sea levels,” said Senator Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex/Mercer). “Governor Murphy’s vision for 100% clean energy by 2035 is an ambitious, yet necessary goal for New Jersey to mitigate these negative effects and help create a more sustainable planet. I commend the LCV and Sierra Club for leading the charge on this front.” Senator Linda Greenstein (D- Mercer and Middlesex).

,Texas Environment,2025-12-02 21:40:21+00:00,Inside Climate News,New Analysis Provides More Evidence That Heat Standards Save Lives,"Liza Gross, Georgina Gustin",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122025/worker-heat-standards-save-lives/,"Similar precautions are included in the heat standard the Biden administration proposed last year, which the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to finalize by early next year.
“The finding that the revised standard so successfully prevented worker heat deaths is evidence that a clear, comprehensive workplace standard is an effective tool for saving lives,” said Michaels.
Donate Now California still had about 100 heat deaths a year from 2010 to 2020.
But applying the conservative estimate that worker deaths decreased by 33 percent after 2010, Dean said, suggests the stronger standard saved about 34 lives per year.
“We hope the federal government will implement a federal heat standard,” Dean said.","Last year was the hottest on record, but global warming isn’t just overheating the planet. It’s killing workers.

Now a new analysis of the impact of state-implemented outdoor heat standards on worker deaths adds to the growing body of scientific research showing that requiring employers to take simple precautions to prevent heat stress can reduce the risk of injury, illness and death from exposure to high temperatures on the job.

Similar precautions are included in the heat standard the Biden administration proposed last year, which the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to finalize by early next year.

Under the proposed federal rule, employers must provide adequate water, rest and shade when the heat index—a measure of how humidity amplifies heat’s effects on the body—reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and take additional measures, such as providing paid 15-minute breaks every two hours, once the index reaches 90 degrees.

For nearly two decades, California was the only state to mandate such protections for outdoor workers. Over the past three years, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have passed similar rules.

In the new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Health Affairs, labor policy experts compared heat-related deaths among outdoor workers in California, which adopted the nation’s first outdoor heat standard in 2005, with neighboring states that have similar climates but lacked a standard during the study period, from 1999 through 2020.

Critics argued that the 2005 standard was not actively enforced and its ambiguous wording allowed employers to skirt requirements. In keeping with those critiques, the researchers saw a drop in worker deaths relative to the surrounding states only after 2010, when the state enhanced enforcement and subsequently strengthened requirements to ensure workers had access to water, shade, breaks and emergency services during hot days.

The California standard became increasingly effective over time, said study author Adam Dean, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University, while worker deaths in the neighboring states of Arizona, Nevada and Oregon increased.

“After 2010, we’re finding a statistically significant association between the heat standard and heat-related outdoor deaths,” said Dean, meaning that the effect seen was not due to chance.

And there was a significant drop in heat-related deaths after stronger enforcement was implemented, Dean said, calling the observed 33 percent reduction in deaths “a conservative estimate.”

California officials ramped up enforcement of the heat standard starting in 2010 by increasing workplace inspections, issuing more citations for violations and expanding educational outreach to both employers and workers.

“The study’s methods are sound and its results are of great importance, documenting the life-saving impact of a comprehensive workplace heat standard,” said epidemiologist David Michaels, a professor at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health and a former top OSHA administrator who was not involved in the study.

“The finding that the revised standard so successfully prevented worker heat deaths is evidence that a clear, comprehensive workplace standard is an effective tool for saving lives,” said Michaels.

Undercounting Heat Deaths

Far too many workers are getting sick and dying from preventable heat-related illnesses, former OSHA deputy assistant secretary Jordan Barab said in formal comments in October as the agency considered a heat standard more than 50 years after government scientists first recommended one.

“And because of severe undercounting,” Barab said, “far more are dying than we even know about.”

Heat-related deaths are routinely undercounted for various reasons, including a failure to recognize how high temperatures trigger fatal heart attacks, strokes and deadly accidents as well as inconsistent reporting by medical professionals and coroners. Heat exposure is extremely risky for workers with underlying heart or lung conditions, especially if they’re laboring in polluted air.

Because working in hot conditions can impair cognitive function and lead to accidental injury and death, Dean and his colleague Jamie McCallum, an expert on worker struggles at Middlebury College, included vehicular deaths related to equipment in agriculture, construction and transportation as potentially caused by heat stress.

While the study didn’t attribute every vehicular fatality to heat, Dean said, if the heat standard is effective, they would have expected to see a decline in those types of deaths relative to other states after implementing the policy. “What we’re saying is that the fact that these kinds of deaths in California decreased relative to those deaths in the neighboring states after the heat standard was passed is evidence in favor of the heat standard having been effective.”

In all, the team identified more than 6,000 heat-related deaths among outdoor workers in 126 counties in Arizona, California, Nevada and Oregon, about 300 deaths a year on average, between 1999 and 2020. Arizona had the most deaths overall and holds the county with the highest number of deaths in a year, Maricopa County, which had 233 deaths in 2020.

All the states had spikes in worker deaths until 2010, when a very rapid increase in deaths in Arizona, plus spikes in Oregon and Nevada, together accounted for the 33 percent drop in California deaths relative to the other states, Dean said.

Dean said the study makes no claim that California’s 2010 enforcement campaign was “perfectly successful.” In fact, he said, worker deaths in California have actually increased since 2010 on average, but the increase in the surrounding states that lack a standard is much more extreme.

California still had about 100 heat deaths a year from 2010 to 2020. But applying the conservative estimate that worker deaths decreased by 33 percent after 2010, Dean said, suggests the stronger standard saved about 34 lives per year.

“Climate change and increasing extreme heat is increasing the risk of heat-related deaths among outdoor workers everywhere,” Dean said. “Heat-standard precautions can mitigate the worst risk.”

Officials with U.S. OSHA did not respond to questions from Inside Climate News about when they expect to finalize the proposed heat standard or whether they will require employers to ensure workers have adequate water, shade and rest periods during hot days.

“Chronic and Persistent Vacancies”

The finding that worker deaths decreased over time in California is notable given perpetual understaffing challenges at Cal/OSHA, the state occupational safety and health agency, as outlined in a recent California State Audit report.

The study indicates that regulations on paper, especially those with loopholes, mean very little without effective enforcement by regulators, said Garett Brown, a retired Cal/OSHA field inspector who now serves as an agency watchdog.

“California’s enforcement gains are currently being undermined by chronic and persistent vacancies among field inspectors,” Brown said, noting that Cal/OSHA is currently operating with 95 inspector vacancies, a third of the available positions, and a $16 million cut in its enforcement budget, Brown said.

Still, just having a standard on the books can help save lives, said Michaels. Many agriculture employers learned about the stronger standard, heard about citations being issued by Cal/OSHA and decided to comply with the standard by providing water, shade and rest breaks, he explained.

“More farmworkers are alive today than would be if the stronger standard were not in effect,” Michaels said. “And more lives will be saved if federal OSHA adopts a similar standard.”

As temperatures continue to rise with greenhouse gas emissions, enforcement will be ever more critical to protecting undocumented workers and others who fear retaliation for taking the precautions that save lives, Dean and other labor experts say.

“We hope the federal government will implement a federal heat standard,” Dean said. “We also worry that it will not be effective in protecting workers unless it’s matched by the kind of increased enforcement that we’ve seen in California since 2010.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1629940610-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:01:27.946562

Food is fuel, food brings people together. Food is also big business, and innovative companies are helping advance the growing and producing of food throughout the world. Agribusiness is a thriving industry, due to consistent demand and continued scientific advances that help farmers and other stakeholders mitigate challenges.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, in its 2022 Census of Agriculture, U.S. farms and ranches produced $543.1 billion in agricultural products, up from $388.5 billion in 2017. The value of crop sales exceeded livestock sales, with crops accounting for 52% of the total.

Increasingly, technology plays a pivotal role in agriculture. The USDA Economic Research Service, in its “America’s Farms and Ranches at a Glance, 2024 Edition”, reported that farms of all sizes are using precision agriculture (PA) technologies to increase yields, reduce purchased input costs, improve environmental quality, and save on labor time. Among the top technologies were yield monitors, yield maps, and soil maps—used by 13% of small farms and 68% of large-scale crop-producing farms. Guidance autosteering systems on tractors, harvesters, and other equipment were used on 9% of small farms and 70% of large-scale crop-producing farms. According to the research, technology such as drones, robotic milking, and wearable livestock technologies are less common, especially among small farms.

While good soil and favorable weather are key components of success in agribusiness, so are location, workforce, and education.

Unlike a one-time purchase, an energy project creates a long-term partnership, often spanning 20–40 years or more.","The U.S. energy sector is undergoing a historic transformation, driven by soaring electricity demand from new technologies, ambitious corporate sustainability goals, and major federal roadblocks. This has triggered a nationwide land rush, placing real property at the center of the energy transition conversation in the U.S. With the existing grid struggling to keep up with increasing power demands, utilities are aggressively shifting from passive energy procurement to direct real estate acquisition and development. For corporate leaders, understanding this new utility strategy is essential for strategic site selection and competitive positioning.

The Utility Shift to Real Estate and Development

Historically, regulated utilities often met renewable energy needs through long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, with independent producers. Today, utilities are increasingly pursuing direct asset ownership.

The primary driver of this shift is that it allows utilities to add the value of a power plant to their “rate base,” which is the value of property on which they are allowed to earn a specified rate of return for shareholders, as set by a public utility commission. Power purchased from others is merely a pass-through expense, offering no such return.

Direct ownership also gives utilities greater control to meet state and federal decarbonization mandates, improve grid reliability, and stabilize long-term prices. This allows them to capture the full project value, including energy, capacity payments, and renewable energy certificates. Consequently, utilities are now competing directly with power producers and commercial developers.

A Comparative Analysis of Key Transaction Models

The decision to build, buy, or simply contract for power is a complex one, forcing utilities and developers to weigh the trade-offs between risk, control, capital investment, and speed. Various transaction model options exist because there is no one-size-fits-all solution; each structure allocates critical variables differently to suit a company’s specific financial situation, risk appetite, and strategic goals.

While no single model is universally preferred, regulated utilities are showing a distinct preference for structures that result in asset ownership — such as direct ownership or build-transfer agreements — because of the powerful incentive to grow their rate base. A build-transfer agreement, or BTA, is a hybrid model where a developer handles the high-risk early stages of a project, such as obtaining site control and permits, before transferring the “de-risked” asset to the utility upon completion. This model leverages developer agility while allowing the utility to add the final asset to its rate base. While this approach mitigates early-stage risk and benefits from specialized developer expertise, it often comes with a higher acquisition cost and requires complex negotiations, especially given current market conditions.

In contrast, entities in deregulated markets or those looking to avoid massive capital outlays continue to rely heavily on the flexibility of power purchase agreements. PPAs remain a common model where a utility or other large electricity consumer buys power from a project owned and operated by an independent power producer for a long term, typically 15–25 years. This allows the power purchaser to avoid all development and operational risk and requires no upfront capital, providing predictable energy costs. However, for a utility, this path forgoes the opportunity to expand its rate base, offers less operational control, and prevents it from directly monetizing tax incentives.

In the direct utility ownership, or “self-build,” model, the utility acts as its own developer, directly acquiring land and managing the entire project. This approach offers maximum control and rate base value but places all development, construction, and financial risk squarely on the utility and its ratepayers. While it maximizes shareholder return, this model can be slower and less efficient than private development.

Mitigating the Top Three Real Estate Legal Challenges

Whatever transactional model utilities choose, proactive risk management is essential for project survival. Energy projects are defined by massive upfront capital investment and long, complex development timelines where real estate is the most critical component. Failing to proactively manage land-related risks means that fatal flaws — such as an undiscovered title defect or community opposition — may only be discovered after millions of dollars have been spent. This reactive approach inevitably leads to crippling delays, explosive budget overruns, and, in a worst-case scenario, the complete abandonment of the project, reducing a promising asset into a substantial financial loss.

First, navigating the zoning and permitting gauntlet is often the most unpredictable part of development due to community opposition and complex regulations. Such opposition and complexity may be mitigated by early and transparent engagement with local officials and community leaders; however, early engagement can be more difficult with a BTA model, where a developer is in control during this phase, potentially leaving the acquiring utility to inherit landowner issues. Success depends on incorporating local zoning codes into initial site screening and utilizing state-level siting authorities where available to streamline approvals.

Second, securing necessary land control is paramount, as unforeseen issues can present fatal flaws to a project. Obtaining option agreements creates site control with minimal upfront capital while also providing a crucial window for due diligence before committing to a long-term agreement. It is also vital to obtain comprehensive land title surveys and proactively negotiate with existing mineral rights holders, a challenge particularly pronounced in states with a long history of oil and gas activity.

Third, navigating landowner relationships from negotiation to operation is critical. Unlike a one-time purchase, an energy project creates a long-term partnership, often spanning 20–40 years or more. A failure to establish a clear and fair agreement at the outset can lead to persistent operational friction and ongoing community opposition. Conflicts can arise over issues not clearly defined in the initial lease, such as maintenance, interference with farming activities, and access rights.

A comprehensive lease agreement, negotiated with transparency, is the foundational document for a lasting relationship. This includes clearly defined compensation with escalator clauses, precise mapping of land use and access rights, and explicit reservation of the landowner’s rights on adjacent property. Proactive operational management, including a designated local point of contact and clearly delineated maintenance duties, can also be beneficial. Finally, planning for decommissioning from the start, with a detailed plan and financial guarantee for land restoration, builds crucial long-term trust.

A C-Suite Guide to Site Selection in the New Energy Paradigm

For corporations planning energy-intensive facilities, the site selection playbook must evolve because the energy landscape itself continues to change focus. Power is no longer a simple commodity; it is now the primary gating factor for any major industrial development — especially as the race to build AI data centers increases demand for electricity. Corporations that adapt their strategies to treat energy as a critical strategic asset can secure a powerful competitive advantage, enabling faster construction and more reliable operations. Failing to evolve risks being saddled with sites that cannot be powered on a viable timeline, leading to catastrophic project delays, stranded capital, and a loss of market position.

Power availability is now the primary factor determining a site’s viability. With grid capacity constrained and interconnection queues backlogged for years, the “time to power” can make or break a major investment. Site selection teams should perform deep diligence on a location’s energy readiness by analyzing the local utility’s integrated resource plan, investigating the regional grid operator’s interconnection queue, and understanding the utility’s preferred transaction models to predict its behavior.

This reality has given rise to the “Bring Your Own Power” imperative, where leading corporations develop on-site generation to ensure power reliability. This strategy requires much larger land parcels that can host both an industrial facility and a power plant, creating a new premium class of “energy-anchored” industrial real estate. Two recent examples highlight this shift. First, Amazon Web Services acquired a 1,200-acre data center campus in Pennsylvania directly connected to a 2.5 GW nuclear power plant, securing up to 960 MW of reliable, carbon-free power through a long-term PPA. Second, Microsoft, as part of its goal to eliminate diesel backup generators by 2030, successfully tested hydrogen fuel cells to power a row of data center servers for 48 consecutive hours, proving the viability of clean hydrogen for providing uninterrupted power.

As corporations navigate this new landscape, executives must integrate an energy-first mindset into their planning. This involves elevating energy to a core business strategy, embedding deep energy diligence at the outset of site selection, future-proofing real estate acquisitions by prioritizing larger sites, and proactively engaging with utilities as strategic partners to understand long-term infrastructure plans.",https://cdn9.areadevelopment.com/article_images/id34503_utilities-are-becoming-developers1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:01:46.759958

Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 MW of natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are also part of a new expedited interconnection study process.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

Last December, Meta announced its intention to develop its largest-ever artificial intelligence (AI) data center campus in Richland Parish, about 30 miles east of Monroe, LA. The $10 billion, 4 million square foot mega site represents one of the largest private capital investments in state history and offers to fundamentally transform the economics of what has been called a “neglected corner” of Louisiana.

But Meta’s $10 billion estimate only covers a portion of what it will cost to get the site online. Entergy Louisiana previously announced it will invest $6 billion in electric infrastructure to power the project, including a 10,000-acre solar farm, three natural gas turbines, and 100 miles of new transmission lines. Carbon sequestration will offset 60% of the new gas emissions with the potential of future wind or solar expansion, according to the company.

Entergy Louisiana argues its customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta’s contributions toward Entergy’s system costs — including storm recovery — are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, the company said.

The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA.","Read Time: 3 mins

On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) issued a proposed rule to amend the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (90 Fed. Reg. 82320, Nov. 20, 2025). The agencies’ proposal responds directly to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), and aims to align federal jurisdiction with the Court’s limitations while reducing ambiguity for regulators and regulated entities.

If finalized, this rule could significantly reduce the number of CWA Section 404 and Section 401 permits required for greenfield and infrastructure development, especially in areas with ephemeral or isolated water features. However, stakeholders should be aware that state-level regulatory responses are likely, particularly in jurisdictions that traditionally exercised broader water protections.

Summary of Key Changes to WOTUS Rule

1. Jurisdictional Waters Re-Defined (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(a))

The proposed rule narrows the WOTUS definition by specifying only two jurisdictional categories:

Traditional Navigable Waters (TNWs)

Relatively Permanent Waters and Their Adjacent Wetlands

This excludes several previously jurisdictional features and emphasizes Sackett’s “continuous surface connection” test.

2. “Relatively Permanent” Standard Clarified (§ 120.2(c)(7))

The rule defines “relatively permanent” as surface waters that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or during the “wet season.” The “wet season” is defined as periods when monthly precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, based on long-term climatic data. Ephemeral streams, by contrast, are excluded under § 120.2(d)(4).

Additionally, such waters must:

Possess a bed and bank

Connect to a downstream jurisdictional water via a relatively permanent flow path (§ 120.2(c)(7)(ii))

Tributaries that flow only in response to precipitation events—i.e., ephemeral streams—are no longer jurisdictional.

3. Adjacent Wetlands Must Be Physically and Hydrologically Connected (§ 120.2(c)(8))

Jurisdictional wetlands must:

Physically abut a jurisdictional water (e.g., TNW or relatively permanent water)

Have surface water continuously present during the wet season

Critically, the rule clarifies that a wetland separated from jurisdictional waters by discrete features (e.g., levees, berms, or culverts) is not “adjacent” unless surface water is continuously present on both sides during the wet season (§ 120.2(c)(8)(ii)).

4. Elimination of “Interstate Waters” as a Standalone Category

Interstate waters are no longer jurisdictional based solely on their interstate nature. They must independently qualify under the revised categories (§ 120.2(b)(1)).

Expanded and Clarified Exclusions (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(d))

The rule proposes new clarity around exclusions:

Groundwater is expressly excluded, including tile-drained and subsurface flows (§ 120.2(d)(1))

Non-navigable ditches constructed entirely in dry land are excluded, even if they eventually convey relatively permanent flow (§ 120.2(d)(3))

Prior Converted Cropland retains its exemption unless abandoned for >5 years and reverted to a WOTUS-qualifying wetland (§ 120.2(d)(2))

Waste Treatment Systems are excluded under an expanded definition that includes treatment ponds, lagoons, and infiltration systems (§ 120.2(d)(5))

Section 404(f) Farming Exemptions remain unchanged, continuing to protect routine agricultural discharges (§ 120.2(f))

Implications for CWA Permitting Programs

CWA Section 404: Fewer Permits, Fewer Delays

By narrowing the scope of WOTUS, the agencies expect a marked reduction in Section 404 permit obligations, particularly for projects involving ephemeral streams and non-abutting wetlands. This is likely to reduce costs, project delays, and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) triggers tied to Section 404 actions.

Notably, in arid or semi-arid regions, where ephemeral waters dominate, the proposal could eliminate permitting requirements for many previously regulated features.

CWA Section 401: Reduced Certification Burden

Because Section 401 certifications are contingent on federal permits, the expected decline in Section 404 permits will lead to fewer 401 certification requests. This may reduce administrative workload for state and tribal agencies.

CWA Section 402: Nuanced Impact

Discharges from point sources to waters no longer deemed jurisdictional may no longer require National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. However, permit obligations may persist if pollutants ultimately reach a WOTUS via hydrological or artificial conveyance systems.

State Response and Potential Regulatory Gaps

While the proposed rule reduces federal oversight, it acknowledges that states and tribes may respond by expanding state-level jurisdiction (90 Fed. Reg. at 82325). Currently, at least 24 states regulate waters more broadly than the federal standard, including Washington, Oregon, and California. These states may develop or expand dredge-and-fill programs to fill potential regulatory gaps.

For instance, Washington State has already initiated steps to establish a Section 404 analog at the state level, ensuring continuity in environmental protection despite federal contraction.

What Should Stakeholders Do Now?

Below are key considerations and timely moves that stakeholders may want to discuss with counsel:

Map and Assess: Identify and reassess project site water features under the revised definitions.

Engage in the Rulemaking: Public comments are due by January 5, 2026, and may be submitted through regulations.gov under Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OW–2025–0322.

Monitor State Responses: Watch for increased state regulation or new permitting schemes in areas where federal oversight is reduced.

Consult Experts: Engage environmental counsel or consultants to navigate evolving federal and state requirements and potential NEPA implications.

The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA. While it is expected to ease permitting burdens and regulatory costs for developers, energy firms, and agricultural stakeholders, it also introduces complexities at the state level that merit close attention.",https://www.mcglinchey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/water-marsh.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:58:46.838430

Global lithium demand is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 12% through 2030, reaching 4.6 million tonnes LCE.","The global lithium market, a critical barometer for the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has entered a new phase of stabilization in late 2025, following a dramatic period of price volatility. After plummeting by as much as 90% from its late 2022 peak, lithium prices have found a floor and are now showing signs of a modest rebound. This pivotal shift offers a more predictable cost environment for EV manufacturers, potentially fueling continued innovation and broader adoption, even as the outlook for EV demand presents a mixed picture across different regions.

The Tumultuous Path to Stability

The journey to lithium price stabilization has been tumultuous. From an all-time high in November 2022, prices experienced a precipitous decline through 2023 and the first half of 2025, driven by an influx of new supply and, at times, concerns over decelerating EV growth in certain markets. This sharp downturn pushed many high-cost lithium producers to curtail or even halt operations, effectively rebalancing the market's severe oversupply. By June 2025, prices began to stabilize, with lithium carbonate futures in China now trading around 94,400 CNY/T (approximately $13,400 USD/metric ton) as of December 2, 2025 – a significant recovery from their lows, reflecting a 25.73% year-to-date gain.

Several factors have converged to underpin this stabilization. Strategic production adjustments by major lithium miners, coupled with a robust and continuously growing global EV demand – particularly strong in China, where new energy vehicle output increased by 33.1% in the first ten months of the year – have been instrumental. Global EV sales surged to 2.1 million units in September 2025, marking a 26% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, ongoing inventory drawdowns and supportive governmental policies, especially in China, have played a crucial role in preventing further price erosion. An emerging demand vector from lithium-based battery storage systems for data centers powering artificial intelligence is also contributing to the upward pressure, with projections indicating a 30-40% surge in overall lithium demand from this sector in 2026. This confluence of supply-side corrections and sustained demand has led analysts like Goldman Sachs to forecast a gradual increase in prices, with battery-grade lithium carbonate potentially reaching $11,000/mt in 2025 and $13,250/mt in 2026.

Despite the recent recovery, the market remains cautiously optimistic. While prices are not expected to revisit their 2022-2023 peaks in the near term, the current stability provides a healthier foundation for the industry. The average EV battery pack price in China, for instance, reached approximately $94 per kWh in 2025, falling below the critical $100/kWh threshold, largely due to cheaper lithium and the widespread adoption of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries. This improved cost predictability is a significant boon for EV manufacturers, allowing for better long-term planning and potentially more affordable electric vehicles for consumers.

Companies Navigating the Evolving Landscape

The stabilization of lithium prices and the mixed EV demand outlook present a varied landscape for public companies across the value chain. Lithium miners, previously battered by the price collapse, are now seeing a path to improved profitability, while EV manufacturers must balance cost benefits with intense competition and regional demand disparities.

For lithium miners, the rebound in prices is a welcome relief. Companies like Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), which saw its stock decline due to weak lithium prices in 2024, are now poised for recovery. Albemarle has demonstrated resilience through cost execution and a focus on its energy storage segment, lifting its 2025 volume growth forecast to over 10% and returning to profitability in Q2 2025. With lithium prices showing a rebound in late 2025, Albemarle's outlook for 2026 appears stronger, with forecasts suggesting sales could reach the $7 billion range. Similarly, Livent (NYSE: LTHM), which faced a weaker outlook during the downturn, could benefit significantly from the market's shift to a potential deficit by 2026, especially given strong long-term demand fundamentals.

On the EV manufacturing front, the impact is more nuanced. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), a global leader, benefits from the overall increase in global EV sales and lower battery costs. The stabilization of lithium prices should support its battery production costs. However, the cautious trajectory of EV adoption in North America, coupled with policy uncertainties and increased competition, could impact its regional sales growth. Tesla's ability to manage costs, innovate, and adapt to regional market dynamics will be crucial.

In stark contrast, BYD (HKEX: 1211) has solidified its position as the largest global EV producer, leveraging its dominance in the rapidly growing Chinese market and strategic expansion into Europe and Latin America. BYD's vertical integration, including investments in lithium mining projects, provides a significant hedge against price volatility. Analysts project a bullish trajectory for BYD's stock, further bolstered by its investments in advanced battery technologies like solid-state and sodium-ion batteries, which could reduce its long-term reliance on fluctuating lithium prices. The continued strength of the Chinese EV market, driven by competitive pricing and government support, positions BYD favorably.

Wider Significance and Industry Ripple Effects

The stabilization of lithium prices and the mixed EV demand outlook are not isolated events; they are profound indicators of broader industry trends, generating significant ripple effects across the global economy and policy landscape. This period echoes historical commodity cycles, where market forces and strategic interventions reshape entire sectors.

A primary trend is the continued drive towards battery technology and cost reduction. The achievement of an average EV battery pack price of $94 per kWh in China in 2025 – falling below the critical $100/kWh threshold – is a game-changer. This is largely due to the cost-effectiveness of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) cells, which are approximately 25% cheaper than NCM/NCA alternatives. This cost advantage, primarily driven by Chinese manufacturing, is creating global downward price pressure, making EVs more accessible and accelerating mass-market adoption.

The supply chain dynamics are also undergoing a critical transformation. The lithium market is transitioning from oversupply to a potentially tighter market by 2025, with a projected deficit by 2026. Looking further ahead, a significant ""raw material disconnect"" is anticipated, with lithium supply potentially trailing EV demand by 572,000 tonnes by 2034. This long-term outlook underscores the urgent need for continuous investment and strategic planning to meet future demand. Investment and resource security have become paramount, with nations like Saudi Arabia investing in lithium projects, while policy uncertainties in regions like the US could hinder domestic supply chain development. The burgeoning Energy Storage Systems (ESS) market, projected to grow by 37% in 2025, is another significant driver of lithium demand, recognizing its role as essential grid infrastructure.

The ripple effects are far-reaching. Economic impact includes reduced EV manufacturing costs, leading to more affordable vehicles and stimulating exponential market growth. However, abrupt policy changes, such as the expiration of federal EV tax credits in the US, can disrupt markets and necessitate financial adjustments for manufacturers. Geopolitical implications are intensifying, with a fierce competition for control over EV and battery technologies, particularly between the US and China. China's proposed restrictions on lithium extraction and refining technologies in early 2025 aim to enhance its control over the global lithium supply chain, highlighting the strategic importance of this critical mineral. From an environmental and sustainability perspective, the push for electrification continues to drive lithium demand, while advancements in extraction technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) are improving efficiency and reducing the environmental footprint. Recycling initiatives are also gaining vital importance.

Regulatory and policy implications are profoundly shaping the market. The anticipated reversal of key EV policies in the US under a potential Trump administration, including the removal of production mandates and the scaling back of federal tax credits, is expected to create significant uncertainty and potentially slow EV adoption. New tariffs on Chinese-made EV batteries and critical raw materials are also projected to raise manufacturing costs. Conversely, China has actively supported its EV market with subsidies, although the expiration of the zero-tax policy on EV purchases at the end of 2025 will likely trigger a surge in late 2025 sales. Europe is promoting green energy policies but also imposing tariffs on low-cost Chinese EVs to protect its domestic industry.

Historically, the current market dynamics echo precedents in other critical commodity industries. The commodity price cycles seen in lithium are similar to those in oil and copper, where periods of oversupply lead to price collapses, followed by production cuts and eventual stabilization. These cycles underscore the challenge of managing supply in volatile global markets and the enduring influence of macroeconomic factors. Just as prolonged low prices in copper can hinder investment in new mines, the recent lithium downturn slowed new project development, potentially leading to future supply shortfalls.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future

The future of lithium prices and EV demand is a complex tapestry woven with short-term volatility and robust long-term growth, demanding strategic pivots and offering both significant opportunities and challenges. As of late 2025, stakeholders are positioning themselves for an evolving landscape.

In the short-term (2025-2026), lithium prices are expected to exhibit some instability, despite the recent rebound. While a small market surplus is predicted for 2025, it is forecast to shift into a deficit by 2026. This suggests continued upward pressure on prices, though significant corrections could occur if supply disruptions don't materialize or if the adoption of alternative battery chemistries accelerates. Global EV sales will continue to rise, exceeding 20 million units in 2025, but regional disparities will persist, with China leading the charge and Europe showing strong growth, while North America faces a more cautious trajectory due to policy uncertainties. The declining average EV battery price, expected to reach US$90 per kWh in 2025, will further enhance affordability.

The long-term (2027-2040) outlook for lithium prices is overwhelmingly bullish, driven by a projected widening supply-demand gap. Global lithium demand is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 12% through 2030, reaching 4.6 million tonnes LCE. By 2030, a significant shortfall of 97 Kt of lithium is anticipated, expanding to 621 Kt by 2040. This structural deficit, combined with risks from project delays and underinvestment, suggests sustained upward pressure on prices. Similarly, long-term EV demand remains robust, with the total EV share of light-vehicle sales globally projected to surge to 44.6% by 2030 and 69.5% by 2035. Heavy-duty electric trucks and buses, along with energy storage systems, will significantly contribute to this growth.

To navigate this future, several strategic pivots are required. Diversifying supply chains and enhancing regional resilience are paramount, with Western nations investing in domestic lithium mining and processing to reduce reliance on concentrated production. Technological innovation in extraction and batteries is crucial, including the widespread adoption of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) for more sustainable and efficient recovery, and continued investment in next-generation battery chemistries like solid-state and sodium-ion batteries. The development of a circular economy through recycling is also essential for resource security and sustainability. Governments must adopt adaptive policy frameworks that support domestic resources and infrastructure, while automakers need to prioritize cost optimization and affordability to accelerate mainstream EV adoption.

Market opportunities are abundant. The lithium-ion battery recycling market is poised for explosive growth, offering a critical solution for resource scarcity. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) present a rapidly expanding demand for lithium beyond EVs. Innovations in Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) offer more environmentally friendly production methods. Emerging EV markets in developing economies, driven by lower-cost models, represent new growth avenues.

However, significant market challenges persist. Geopolitical and supply chain risks remain high due to concentrated production. The market is still susceptible to oversupply and price fluctuations. Infrastructure gaps, particularly in charging networks, need massive expansion. Regulatory uncertainty from shifting government policies can create unpredictable market conditions. The emergence of alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion could impact lithium demand in certain segments. Finally, environmental and social concerns of mining require continuous innovation in sustainable practices.

Comprehensive Wrap-up and Investor Outlook

The global lithium and EV markets are at a pivotal juncture in late 2025, characterized by a hard-won stabilization in lithium prices and a dynamically growing, albeit regionally varied, demand for electric vehicles. This intricate interplay underscores a market in transition, driven by strategic supply adjustments, evolving policies, and rapid technological advancements.

Key takeaways highlight lithium's impressive rebound in 2025, driven by robust demand, inventory drawdowns, and Chinese regulatory tightening. While global EV demand continues its upward trajectory, with over 20 million units expected in 2025, regional nuances are significant, particularly China's dominance. A crucial new demand driver is the emerging need for lithium in AI data centers, projected to surge by 30-40% in 2026, fundamentally expanding lithium's value proposition beyond transportation. The imperative for strategic supply chain security has also become a defining feature, with substantial investments aimed at diversifying sources and reducing reliance on concentrated production.

The market assessment reveals a shift from oversupply to a potentially tighter balance in 2025, with a looming deficit by 2026 and beyond. This is fueled by producers' supply cuts and delayed projects, alongside soaring EV manufacturing and energy storage system demands. However, the ""great raw material disconnect"" – where the lengthy timeline for new lithium mine development lags behind rapid battery facility expansion – persists, demanding massive investment. The EV market, while expanding significantly, faces challenges from market saturation and policy reversals in some regions, despite advancements in battery efficiency and charging infrastructure.

The lasting impact of these dynamics includes a fundamental reshaping of global supply chains, with a strong push for localization outside China to mitigate geopolitical risks. Technological evolution is accelerating, with LFP batteries gaining prominence and gigafactories preparing for next-gen chemistries like solid-state. The increased importance of recycling for a circular economy is undeniable, becoming crucial to supplement primary lithium sources. Perhaps most significantly, lithium's newfound role as a critical enabler for AI infrastructure signifies a profound shift in its perceived value and procurement, adding another layer of demand pressure that will reverberate for years to come.

For investors, navigating this market requires a nuanced approach. Lithium miners with low production costs, diversified operations, and strong ESG practices are well-positioned for the long-term, given the potential for structural deficits. Battery manufacturers innovating in chemistry and securing robust supply agreements offer substantial opportunities. EV manufacturers must demonstrate strong technological differentiation, competitive pricing, and adaptability to regional policy shifts and market dynamics. Companies involved in infrastructure and technology providers for charging, recycling, and advanced extraction (like DLE) are poised for growth. Key risks include market saturation, abrupt policy changes, technological challenges, and the capital intensity of new ventures. Diversification across the value chain and thorough due diligence are paramount. The unexpected, yet powerful, AI-driven demand for lithium introduces a new dimension to investment theses, potentially accelerating market tightening and price increases beyond what EV growth alone would dictate, making lithium an even more critical commodity for the future.

The project teams will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the Nation’s capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains. The selections announced today will help deliver new nuclear generation in the early 2030s, strengthen domestic supply chains, and advance President Trump’s Executive Orders to usher in a nuclear renaissance and expand America’s Energy Dominance agenda.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

With today’s announcement, DOE is supporting the following first-mover teams to develop and construct the first Gen III+ small modular reactor (Gen III+ SMR) plants in the United States:

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) - $400,000,000

TVA plans to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee, as well as accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl. Additionally, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

Holtec Government Services, LLC (Holtec) - $400,000,000

Holtec plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, demonstrating viability for additional orders both domestically and abroad. Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

As the nation prepares for continued growth in electricity demand, President Trump has charged DOE with adding new, affordable and reliable energy to keep America energy secure. Small modular reactors offer flexible deployment, proven technology, and the ability to leverage existing supply chains, making them one of the fastest and most scalable pathways to new nuclear capacity.

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.

While federal agencies have scaled back EJ initiatives, states are increasingly stepping in to fill the gap–advancing new policies, legislation, and regulatory approaches aimed at integrating EJ considerations into environmental permitting and enforcement. In this edition of the Environmental Justice Update, we examine the latest key trends, policy initiatives, and legal developments reshaping the EJ landscape.

Federal

In June 2025, a coalition of almost two dozen nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for terminating over 400 grants under the Environmental and Climate Justice (ECJ) Block Grants program created under the Inflation Reduction Act (Public Law No: 117-169) (IRA), arguing that the grant terminations were unlawful. The plaintiffs contended that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious, contravened the Presentment Clause and separation of powers, and disregarded Congress’ directive to fund the grants.

In July 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta co-led a multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general in submitting an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit. Among other points, the amicus brief argued that the termination of the program disproportionately harms marginalized and historically disadvantaged communities, undermining the core purpose of Congress’s instruction to EPA when it passed the IRA.

In a 29 August 2025 opinion, US District Judge Richard Leon of the District of Columbia denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, saying: “Put simply, I cannot order the Government to reinstate contracts and pay money due on them.” (emphasis in original). Pointing to decisions from earlier this year by the US Supreme Court pertaining to Department of Education grants and grants from the National Institute of Health, Judge Leon also dismissed the case, agreeing with EPA that the suit belonged before the US Court of Federal Claims.

The majority of plaintiffs appealed Judge Leon’s decision to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on 16 September 2025. Plaintiff’s emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal was denied as the court found “that harm to the plaintiffs if the grant funds were returned to the Treasury was not irreparable.”

As this legal dispute plays out, Congress’s rescission of all unobligated funding under the ECJ Block Grants program as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Public Law No.: 119-21), increases the potential difficulty plaintiffs may face in quickly reinstating their grants.

Multistate EJ Guidance

In response to the rollback of EJ under the Trump Administration earlier this year,1 many states have recommitted to EJ protections through a multistate EJ guidance. Specifically, in June 2025, a coalition of state attorney generals from 13 states2 issued the “Multi-State Guidance Affirming the Importance and Legality of Environmental Justice Initiatives.” This document aims to identify sources of legal support for state EJ laws and to provide assurances to stakeholders that EJ practices remain legal despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to curtail them.

The “Multi-State Guidance” challenges the Trump Administration’s labeling of EJ as “illegal discrimination,” locating support for EJ in a variety of federal statutes and the US Constitution. Specifically, the document finds key support in:

The US Constitution:

The Tenth Amendment: Granting states the power to pass laws that advance “Public health, safety, and welfare.”

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: Barring state and local governmental entities from discriminating based on race or sex.

The First Amendment: Barring the government from conditioning benefits on the waiver of free speech rights.

Civil rights statutes, including:

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Preventing those receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race, color, and national origin.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972: Preventing federal funding recipients from discriminating on the basis of disability, age, or sex, respectively.

Title VIII of the Federal Fair Housing Act: Outlawing public or private discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin in activities related to housing.

Federal environmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act’s requirement for public notice and public comment.

Nonprofit laws that prevent the revocation of 501(c)(3) status by presidential executive order or directive.

Treaty obligations to Native American tribes.

In addition to laying out what they see as the legal basis for EJ, and based on this analysis, the state attorneys general provide a “non-exhaustive [list of] examples of work that public entities, non-profit and philanthropic organizations, and businesses lawfully undertake to advance environmental justice.” These activities fall into several broad categories:

Education, technical assistance, and funding support

Public engagement and participation

Burden identification and analysis

Preventing and mitigating pollution exposures

Climate readiness and resilience

Enforcement and remedies

In sum, the multistate guidance seeks to offer stability and assurance to stakeholders by providing clarity on the EJ strategies and resources that remain available to communities in the wake of the federal repeal of EJ initiatives.

Alaska

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the Republican reconciliation effort passed in July 2025, has impacted US energy and natural resource development across states and industries. Alaska is one state in particular that is positioned to experience a significant change in energy policy as a result of OBBBA. Two key OBBBA provisions—mandatory lease sales in Alaska and an adjustment of revenue sharing rates—have drawn attention from Alaska’s tribal communities, both for their potential to stimulate economic development and for the increased risk of negative environmental impacts that development could bring.

Specifically, OBBBA directs the secretary of the interior to conduct oil and gas lease sales in certain sections of Alaskan land over the next 10 years, repealing the Biden Administration’s limitation on oil and gas leasing on millions of acres in Alaska and restoring leasing policies established under the first Trump Administration. In addition, OBBBA provides an adjustment of future revenue splits from oil and gas royalties between Alaska and the federal government. This change will result in additional revenue to the Alaska Permanent Fund, which provides cash dividends directly to Alaska residents, along with state and local governments and support services.

Responses to the changes in OBBBA from Native American organizations in Alaska have been mixed. Some Native American groups have shared their appreciation for the OBBBA’s reversal of Biden administration land policies, stating that the previous administration ignored “Alaska Native self-determination” by withdrawing millions of acres of Alaskan land from development and eliminating avenues of Tribal tax revenue. Other Tribal organizations in Alaska opposed OBBBA and have expressed serious concerns that the “aggressive” oil, gas, and coal development directed in the bill puts “ecologically sensitive and culturally significant” lands at risk. Tribal groups have argued that increased carbon emissions from new oil and gas developments, combined with local pollution from energy infrastructure, will exacerbate the already-significant environmental risks.

California

Earlier this year, the state of California filed a lawsuit against the city of Tulare, a small city south of Fresno, for alleged violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The suit, filed in January by Attorney General Rob Bonta, claims that Tulare improperly approved a zoning ordinance that allows the development of cold-storage facilities in light and heavy industrial zones. Tulare approved the zoning ordinance in 2024 without conducting an environmental review under CEQA, claiming that the ordinance was exempt from the law’s requirements. Bonta’s suit argues that these cold-storage facilities could pose increased “air pollution and cancer risks” in “a previously racially-segregated community that is now one of the most pollution-burdened and disadvantaged communities in the State.” The case was disposed on 29 April 2025. Notwithstanding, the litigation highlights the state’s efforts to put pressure on a local government to fulfill its legal obligations to mitigate potential environmental harms to residents.

Colorado

This summer, Colorado’s Environmental Justice Action Task Force (Task Force) sought nominations for communities facing environmental inequities to analyze and improve health impacts. The Task Force was originally created on 2 July 2021 with the passing of HB21-1266. Housed in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the main goal of the Task Force is to propose recommendations to the general assembly on how to address EJ inequalities, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. On 14 November 2022, the Task Force published a final report detailing their work and findings over the previous year. In this report, the task force recommended that CDPHE develop a branch of the department to conduct environmental equity and cumulative impact analyses (EECIA) across the state. This recommendation led to the passing of HB24-1338 on 28 May 2024.

HB24-1338 created an Office of Environmental Justice (the Office) housed within CDPHE. This Office specifically oversees the development process of EECIAs in selected geographic areas of Colorado with the goal of understanding how environmental factors affect the health and well-being of Colorado residents. When selecting these areas, the Office must choose disproportionately impacted communities, particularly those affected by a heightened exposure to environmental contaminants. Other factors in this selection process include the proportion of low-income families, the percentage of people of color, and locations with a history of environmental racism. Once these areas are selected, the Office will partner with an academic institution or another third-party to develop an EECIA, which involves hiring a contractor to perform scientifically rigorous analyses recommended by the Task Force. Some of these recommendations include increasing oversight at petroleum refineries, improving the response of the Air Pollution Control Division to air pollution complaints, and analyzing the cumulative impacts of pollution in the air, water, and soil of these communities. Within nine months of completing the EECIA, CDPHE will prepare a report identifying its findings and recommending resources to address environmental inequities.

The impact of these EECIA analyses is intended to help direct funds and resources from the state level to the local level to address issues for communities most exposed to environmental stressors, such as pollution and extreme heat conditions.

Illinois

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) is drafting proposed statutory language to formally codify the agency’s EJ policy and associated environmental permitting review procedures. Illinois EPA is proposing to limit the enhanced permitting review process to census tracts scoring in the 25th percentile or higher based on certain environmental indicators, with the underlying data to be updated every three years.

At the same time, several proposed EJ bills have yet to pass, including SB1307 and SB1686, which propose to amend the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and the Illinois Environmental Justice Act respectively, and the bills remain in Assignments (Committee) after the first readings. Against this backdrop, the Illinois Pollution Control Board opened a docket for interested parties to submit proposals for procedural regulations to “provide guidance to the Board when considering EJ issues, including the selection of screening tools for identifying areas of EJ concern, in its proceedings.” Illinois EPA, the Illinois Attorney General and various environmental interest groups have submitted comments.

The proposed legislation follows a 24 March 2025 EPA announcement that Illinois EPA had satisfied its obligations under the February 2025 Informal Resolution Agreement, which was issued to resolve allegations that Illinois EPA engaged in discriminatory permitting processes. Under the Informal Resolution Agreement, Illinois EPA committed, among other objectives, to “implement[ ] enhancements to its permit review process” and “ensure [Illinois] EPA’s public involvement process will be available to all persons[.]”

Under the current EJ policy, permitting actions in “areas of EJ concern”—defined as “a census block group with a low-income and/or minority population greater than twice the statewide average”—are subject to stricter scrutiny and heightened public participation requirements. Illinois EPA currently utilizes a GIS mapping tool, known as EJ Start, to determine areas of EJ concern within the state.

Massachusetts

Enacted under Senate Bill 2521 in August 2024, the Environmental Justice Trust (Trust) was signed into Massachusetts’ state budget following a joint proposal by Attorney General (AG) Andrea Joy Campbell, Representative Brandy Fluker-Oakley, and Senator Adam Gomez. Funded through civil penalties that are received in judgments and settlements from state cases involving the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Division, the Trust seeks to benefit community health by using these funds to address economic, environmental, and health-related burdens frequently faced by residents in disadvantaged communities. The Trust will help to address longstanding disparities in environmental health faced primarily by lower-income communities in Massachusetts.

The Trust is funded by the penalties accrued from cases against:

Companies that illegally emit or emit beyond permitted amounts, toxins and other pollutants into the air;

Contractors who expose employees to asbestos during demolitions;

Companies that discharge pollutants into local rivers and streams either illegally or beyond the scope of their permits; and

Entities that wrongfully destroy essential areas of wetland and green spaces that increase flood potential in surrounding communities.

The Trust allows monies to be directed at impacted communities to address financial burdens caused by violations, rather than the monies going into the commonwealth’s general fund. The money in the Trust will specifically be used to restore impacted natural resources, investigate environmental pollution or harm caused to local property, benefit the overall health of the affected community, and provide support to academic or government-funded research to further identify environmental protection and conservation measures in these areas.

On 27 January 2025, the AG’s Office announced that the first payments of a consent judgment against four companies, totaling US$155,000, would be placed into the Trust. More recently, on 8 September 2025, a local Massachusetts company reached an agreement with the AG’s Office for a settlement of US$300,000 in civil penalties, of which US$150,000 will be deposited into the Trust for a violation of the Massachusetts Clean Air Act and illegal asbestos removal. On 10 September 2025, the AG’s Office announced another settlement agreement with a Massachusetts based company for US$115,000 in penalties, with US$55,000 going into the Trust, for illegally handling, removing, and storing asbestos.

Maryland

On 17 July 2025, Governor Wes Moore signed the Valuing Opportunity, Inclusion, and Community Equity Executive Order (The VOICE Order). The VOICE Order, which went into effect immediately, creates the Interagency Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Council (the Council), which will strive to create a unified front among the state’s agencies to deal with the issue of environmental inequity. Made up of representatives from 14 state agencies appointed by the governor, the Council will coordinate state efforts, track relevant spending, and perform several other tasks to advise the agencies on advancing the governor’s EJ priorities. For example, the VOICE Order requires agencies to use Maryland’s EJ mapping tool, MDEnviroScreen, to “track and address disparities related to environmental hazards, exposures, risks, health outcomes, investments and benefits.”

Critically, the Council is tasked with developing enhanced public participation plans for communities with EJ concerns potentially affected by certain resource extraction, waste management, and industrial and manufacturing processes and activities. The Council will also provide technical assistance to localities in developing and implementing EJ programs and making concrete recommendations to the governor regarding how to best address disparate environmental health impacts caused by state action.

Michigan

On 1 July 2025 and 22 July 2025, Senate Bill 479 and House Bill 4742, entitled the “Protecting Overburdened Communities Act,” was introduced to amend Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) environmental permitting review process. The law would require EGLE to consider the cumulative impact of all pollutant types associated with a potential project. Additionally, the bill would require the agency to account for the greater risk of harm that social and economic factors have on communities. EGLE will use its EJ screening tool, MiEJScreen, to assess projects for environmental risk. If EGLE finds a negative impact on overburdened communities without a compelling need for the project, it has authority under the legislation to deny a permit application. Further, the policy requires permit applicants to give their community 60 days’ notice for a public hearing on the permit and prepare a project impact statement. Applicants must publish the information in at least two community newspapers, including a local non-English paper.

The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources and Tourism and the Senate Committee on Energy and Environment in July and has not progressed further as of the date of this publication.

New Jersey

On 8 October 2025, the New Jersey Appellate Division held oral arguments on the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s (NJDEP) adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:1C (the Rules), which implement the Environmental Justice Law N.J.S.A. 13:1D-157 to -161 (the EJ Law).

Petitioners focused on aspects of the Rules that they argue go beyond the authority granted to NJDEP under the EJ Law, such as the Rules’ application to “zero population blocks”, and the Rules’ definitions for terms such as new facility, existing facility, expansion, and geographic point of comparison. Petitioners and amici further raised the lack of predictability that the Rules provide, particularly in terms of timing of the EJ process and NJDEP’s application of the EJ stressors, which petitioners noted were implemented in the EJMAP tool without being properly subject to administrative procedures.

In response, NJDEP argued that the department reasonably and permissibly filled in the gaps provided in the law using its expertise. NJDEP and its amici also argued that the Rules’ definitions meet the plain language test and are consistent with defined terms in other NJDEP regulatory programs. The court pressed NJDEP on a number of issues including the Rules’ threshold for measuring the contribution of adverse cumulative stressors, NJDEP’s development of its EJMAP, and the fact that the Rules do not factor economic considerations.

The court has taken the matter under advisement for further consideration.

Conclusion

Our EJ Task Force continues to closely monitor developments in this rapidly evolving area, including the updates highlighted above. As the EJ focus continues to evolve, businesses—particularly those operating in overburdened communities—should remain vigilant and track policy shifts and enforcement trends at both the federal and state levels. Staying informed and proactive is essential to managing risk and aligning with emerging compliance expectations.

NATIONWIDE – Today, on the 55th anniversary of the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, a coalition of environmental justice groups representing millions of people living in frontline and fenceline communities across the U.S. call out the Trump administration’s efforts through the Agency to abandon its mission over the last year, and push for a comprehensive repositioning to center environmental justice for all. The Trump administration’s EPA has moved forward with the most unprecedented actions in the Agency’s history, including rollbacks to clean air, water, and worker protections, cutting staff, defunding programs, rescinding critical grants, and prioritizing polluters – all at the expense of environmental justice communities. In response, a coalition of environmental justice networks are pushing back to hold the line for life-saving protections and to empower people to hold the EPA accountable for a better and renewed vision that truly protects the health of everyone. The coalition, which includes the Moving Forward Network (MFN), Climate Justice Alliance (CJA), Equitable & Just National Climate Platform (EJNCP), Environmental Justice Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform (EJHA), and the Environmental Justice Leadership Forum (EJLF)

QUOTES

“The EPA was born from the power of our voices demanding for our fundamental rights to clean air, water, and land to be protected. Over half a century later, we cannot let the EPA dismantle critical protections that will allow polluters to once again poison our water, fill our lungs with smog, and disproportionately harm environmental justice communities. The future is ours to shape! We will keep fighting for an EPA and government that protects our rights, our health, and our future where all people breathe clean air, drink clean water, and have the opportunity to thrive.” – Anastasia Gordon, Director of Federal Policy at WE ACT for Environmental Justice

“Our communities built the movement that created the EPA 55 years ago. We refuse to go back to the days of burning rivers and deadly smog. The Trump administration is twisting the EPA’s mission on its head, and sacrificing our health and the livelihoods of our families for the sake of billionaires’ profits. We won’t stand by while the few protections we have left are dismantled. We demand clean air, safe water, and a healthy future for every family, no matter their ZIP code.” – Mar Zepeda, Legislative Director, Climate Justice Alliance

“Fifty-five years ago, people-power led by communities on the frontlines of pollution and injustice pushed our government to create the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA. That power still lives in environmental justice communities today. The EPA is meant to protect us from corporate polluters. Now is the moment to demand a new path, one where the EPA and our government truly embed environmental justice, honor community leadership, and deliver full health protections our communities have fought for across generations.”– Paulina López, Duwamish River Community Coalition, Seattle, Member of the Environmental Justice Leadership Forum

“Intense public concern over pollution and advances in science led to the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 55 years ago. Today, clean air, clean water, safe food and thriving communities remain enduring demands of the American people. The Trump Administration’s rollback of critical environmental regulations, elimination of environmental justice grants, and attacks on science fundamentally betray EPA’s mission and stand on the wrong side of history. Join the conversation about creating a roadmap for an EPA and federal government that truly protects public health and the environment, addresses the climate crisis, and embeds justice and equity throughout its programs.” –Charles Lee, Principle Author of the foundational report Toxic Wastes and Race, former Senior Policy Adviser at the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights at the EPA, Visiting Scholar at Howard University School of Law

“When the first Earthday gathering happened, thousands of people turned up in Central Park on the Upper West Side of Manhattan to demand that we, as a nation, pay more attention to addressing environmental threats and harms. Just a few miles north in the historic Harlem neighborhood a huge Black and brown community was struggling with air pollution triggered asthma rates, lead poisoning from old housing stock, a lack of green space, and many other environmental threats. But for the most part my neighbors and I had no idea the historic Earthday gathering was taking place in Central Park, and we were not invited. One especially significant outgrowth of the first Earthday celebration was the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I didn’t know it at the time, but the standing-up of the U.S. EPA and the formation of West Harlem Environmental Action (WE ACT) some seventeen years later, would become intertwined as we worked to fight against a host of environmental harms enveloping our community. Most especially air pollution owing to the fact that we had the highest levels of PM 2.5 exposure of any community in the United States. Along with alarmingly high incidences of asthma and rates of premature death from asthma and other respiratory diseases. In collaboration with Harlem Hospital, the Columbia University Children’s Environmental Health Center, and the NY Urban program of NRDC we worked for thirty years to urge EPA to lower the level of the PM 2.5 standard which triggered local, state and federal action to improve air quality, particularly in overburdened communities like ours. Last year the Biden-Harris administration finally lowered the PM 2.5 standard from 12 to 9 micrograms. But a few days ago the current administration decided to abandon that revised standard and revert back to the higher level of allowable exposure. We know that many more people will die as a result of exposure to this hazardous air pollutant. Rest assured that we will not relent in our advocacy to restore EPA to its former glory, and to see them once again vigorously enforce environmental regulations to protect vulnerable communities like ours.” – Vernice Miller-Travis, Co-Founder and Board Member of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, Executive Vice President at Metropolitan Group

“Dr. Clarice E. Gaylord, the first Director and Founder of EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice along with a cadre of early environmental justice grassroot community leaders and a multi-discipline force of dedicated individuals from academia, business, local government and nonprofit organizations laid the groundwork for such a Roadmap. Prime examples were created both Agency specific as well as via interagency partnerships to promote national community driven projects. Two of these examples I managed and are most proud of is the 2003 EJ Collaborative Problem Solving (EJCPS) Grant Program (led by Dr. Gaylord) and the 2005 Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) Program (led by Rob Brenner formerly of the Office of Air and Radiation). Most importantly, was the development of Agency wide management of these two programs. There was both a national management as well as a regional management. EPA headquarters and regions managed the EJCPS program and for the CARE program there was added specific federal interagency agencies to assist in management. Building upon the foundation of these two very successful programs, with adequate time and resources could begin tackling the complex social and economic problems in local communities across the nation.” – Dr. Marva King Lorthridge, former Senior Policy Advisor with the Environmental Justice Office of the EPA

“People-power built the EPA 55 years ago, and people-power must save it now. As corporate polluters work to gut safeguards and steer the agency away from its mission, we cannot lose sight of what’s at stake. The Environmental Protection Network stands with communities across the country in demanding an EPA that truly serves the public — one that centers communities, equity and justice in every decision.” – Michelle Roos, Executive Director, Environmental Protection Network

The City of Bloomington, in partnership with the Indiana Energy Independence Fund, has received a $250,000 Municipal Investment Fund (MIF) grant to advance its newly created Bloomington Energy Works program, which offers free energy audits and provides educational opportunities on the benefits of energy efficiency and clean energy projects.

The Municipal Investment Fund is a 50-state strategy launched by Coalition for Green Capital (CGC) and ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability USA (ICLEI USA) to empower communities to use public/private investing to accelerate the development and construction of smart energy infrastructure projects across the country.

Bloomington Energy Works will drive a public-private partnership plan to develop finance ready clean power and energy efficiency projects. The program will use a ‘whole community approach’ to accelerate the development of a project pipeline that grows the local economy, lowers energy costs, and builds grid resilience. Further, participation in this program opens the door to potential $2 million in additional funding to accelerate energy projects that benefit Bloomington residents and businesses.

“Preparing Bloomington for the future means strengthening our infrastructure, lowering costs for residents, and supporting good local jobs,” said Mayor Kerry Thomson. “We’re proud to have been selected by the Coalition for Green Capital and ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability to participate in the Municipal Investment Fund program and receive a $250,000 grant. This partnership gives us the tools to plan and deliver projects that make daily life more reliable, affordable, and efficient for everyone who lives and works here.”

Bloomington Energy Works offers free energy audits to developers and large commercial, manufacturing, nonprofit, and academic institution building owners located within the city limits. The audits will be completed by Donovan Energy, an energy efficiency consultant, on a first come, first serve basis. The audits will result in a list of impactful energy conservation measures tailored to each site plan review or building’s energy consumption such as HVAC optimization, heat pump HVAC upgrades, LED lighting upgrades, solar system installations, etc. Building owners will be provided information about available incentives and a complete financial analysis to understand the return on investments. Sign up for a free energy audit by visiting the Bloomington Energy Works’ website and filling out the application.

Additionally, Bloomington Energy Works will conduct a new public outreach campaign called Energy Navigator!, in partnership with Electrify Indiana, to promote energy efficiency solutions to Bloomington residents.

Last fall, DOE announced $80 million in RMUC funding that will directly support more than 400 electric co-ops’ cybersecurity programs.
Electric co-ops are committed to doing their part, but collaborating with the federal government remains crucial, Lindahl said.
“With continued partnership and targeted investment, we can strengthen our defenses, protect critical infrastructure, and keep the lights on for 42 million Americans.

“Smart, targeted federal support through funding, workforce development and improved threat intelligence sharing is essential,” Tim Lindahl, president and CEO of Kenergy Corp., testified at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy.

“This will help close the resource gap and ensure rural communities are not left behind in the national effort to secure our energy infrastructure.”

Specifically, Lindahl asked lawmakers to reauthorize the Department of Energy’s Rural and Municipal Utility Cybersecurity Program and release its remaining funds. RMUC, a $250 million, five-year program authorized by Congress through fiscal year 2026, represents what he called “a generational opportunity to improve the cybersecurity posture of electric cooperatives and municipally owned electric utilities.”

“RMUC prioritizes co-ops with the greatest need of support that serve the nation’s most critical infrastructure, including military installations, to help them make the necessary investment to secure the grid,” Lindahl said.

Last fall, DOE announced $80 million in RMUC funding that will directly support more than 400 electric co-ops’ cybersecurity programs.

“Much of that funding has yet to be released to the award winners,” Lindahl said. “We encourage DOE to move expeditiously to distribute the awarded funds so that electric cooperatives can put them into action to defend their critical infrastructure.”

Electric co-ops face unique challenges in securing the grid because of their rural, often remote, locations and the fact that they are not-for-profit businesses, he said.

“Because cooperatives operate without shareholders or profit incentives, financing costly investments often requires reliance on debt, which must be approved by their boards and is ultimately paid back through rates paid by their members,” Lindahl explained, adding that one in four households served by co-ops earns less than $35,000 a year.

“These resource constraints can make it difficult to invest in advanced technologies and recruit and retain a skilled cyber workforce necessary to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, especially those from nation-state actors.”

Despite these obstacles, co-ops are uniting to do everything they can to improve their cyber readiness, said Lindahl, whose Henderson-based co-op serves over 60,000 homes and businesses.

“Co-ops across the country are coming together and thinking innovatively to overcome these challenges,” he said. “The seven cooperative principles, like concern for community and cooperation among cooperatives, are the driving force behind what we do.

“Additionally, our national trade association, NRECA, is leveraging private and public dollars to develop cybersecurity tools and resources to improve information sharing, deploy new technologies and build a capable workforce.”

Among those tools, he said, are the NRECA Threat Analysis Center, a secure technology platform that helps the co-op community detect, analyze and communicate cybersecurity threats, and the Co-op Cyber Goals Program, which helps co-ops improve their cyber defenses.

Electric co-ops are committed to doing their part, but collaborating with the federal government remains crucial, Lindahl said.

“With continued partnership and targeted investment, we can strengthen our defenses, protect critical infrastructure, and keep the lights on for 42 million Americans. The last two decades have seen significant advancement in how electric cooperatives secure our grid, but there is much more work still to do.”

(the ""Company"") (TSXV: DME) (U.S. OTC: DMEHF) (Frankfurt: QM01) from the President of the Company. DME is pleased to announce it has signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to form a joint venture to build and operate a sodium–nickel–chloride (""SNC"") battery manufacturing facility in Roswell, New Mexico. The proposed operation would utilize produced water from regional oil and gas wells as part of an environmentally responsible cooling and processing system designed to support both battery production and a planned artificial-intelligence (""AI"") data-center complex.

Strategic Use of Produced Water & Integration with AI Data Center

Under the contemplated structure, produced water from area operators would be treated and repurposed for cooling and processing needs, thereby significantly reducing the volume of water extracted from the aquifer, as well as lowering operating costs for smaller oil and gas producers. Desert Mountain Energy's own wells generate minimal produced water, but the Company's processing expertise positions it to serve as a strategic solutions provider to neighboring operators.

The initiative also supports the Company's plan to use its natural-gas resources to generate local electricity for the produced-water system and the adjacent AI data-center infrastructure, creating a vertically integrated and energy-efficient footprint.

Sodium, REE and By-Product Management

As part of the produced-water treatment process, salts and certain critical rare earth elements (""REEs"") are extracted and separated.

Sodium will be dried and utilized directly in the production of SNC battery units.

Isolated REEs will be dried, sealed, and shipped to qualified facilities for further refining.

This creates multiple value-added revenue streams while minimizing waste and maximizing the commercial usefulness of extracted materials.

About SNC Battery Technology

Sodium–nickel–chloride batteries are known for their stability, long lifecycle, and strong safety profile. Unlike lithium-ion systems, SNC batteries cannot burn or explode, making them well-suited for grid support, industrial power systems, and data-center applications. Altech Batteries Ltd., a global leader in the space, is currently constructing a US$170 million SNC plant in Saxony, Germany, underscoring the technology's growing commercial relevance.

Altech's publicly available research notes several advantages for SNC chemistry, including the potential for alumina sourced from recycled specialty aircraft components—supporting broader circular-economy initiatives.

Economic Benefits for Roswell and the State of New Mexico

The joint venture and associated AI-infrastructure development are expected to create new job opportunities and diversify revenue sources for Chaves County and the State of New Mexico. Increased support services for smaller oil and gas operators—including lower disposal costs and extended well life—are expected to lead to higher production levels, which in turn increase tax contributions to local schools, counties, and state programs.

The initiative aligns with local, state, and federal programs offering incentives for energy-transition manufacturing, critical-materials management, and advanced-technology deployment, including elements referenced in yesterday's Genesis Mission Executive Order from the White House.",https://www.nacleanenergy.com/images/,N,,2025-12-02 22:58:48.045419

Recalls, and battery supplier risk

Recent headlines highlight the risks. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) urged consumers to stop using and properly dispose of certain Rad Power Bikes batteries (models RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304) after dozens of reports of fires and significant property damage. The New York Times reports on the CPSC advisory, emphasizing the urgency of the issue.

CPSC said in its news release the following: “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris. CPSC is aware of 31 reports of fire, including 12 reports of property damage totaling approximately $734,500. Some of these incidents occurred when the battery was not charging, the product was not in use, and the product was in storage. The batteries were manufactured in China.”

China is the world’s largest source of lithium-ion cells and packs, with both top-tier manufacturers and low-cost vendors, making robust battery suppliers vetting essential. The key risks with third-party battery suppliers include inconsistent cell grading and matching, undocumented part substitutions, relabeled or counterfeit cells, weak battery management system calibration, inadequate process controls for moisture and contamination, poor weld and insulation quality, gaps in traceability, and logistics exposures such as temperature extremes and handling damage.

Tesla recently recalled about 10,500 Powerwall 2 home battery systems due to a third-party battery cell defect that could cause overheating and, in some cases, smoke or fire. If a high-end, stationary system can be exposed to a supplier defect, the risk from third-party or mismatched batteries and chargers in e-bikes is even clearer.

Rad Power Bikes disputes the CPSC’s findings, citing a low incident rate compared to over 100,000 units and claiming compliance with high standards, stating, “The incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent. While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products.”

The statement continues: “Contrary to the CPSC's statement, mere exposure to water and debris does not create a hazard; rather, significant water exposure, as warned against in our manuals, can pose a hazard. These risks apply across industries and exist even in products that are fully UL compliant.”

Certify the system, not just the pack

This kind of conflict is precisely what unified, enforceable standards aim to prevent, where everyone in the e-bike ecosystem agrees to follow — manufacturers, third-party battery suppliers, importers, retailers, building managers, and riders.

When standards are harmonized, independently verified, and tied to traceable certifications, disputes can be resolved with data against an agreed baseline. Without that baseline, safety becomes a negotiation, with different rules by city, landlord, marketplace, or brand allowing risky products or practices to linger in the market and in homes.

Uniform standards must address the entire electrical system, not just the battery pack. That means mandating recognized certifications for both the pack and the complete e-bike system, validating cell quality, battery management architecture, thermal and abuse performance, ingress protection, and charger compatibility, to name a few.

Enforcement, traceability, and rider education

But paper standards without enforcement are promises without protection. Regulators should harmonize requirements across jurisdictions and enforce them at ports, during market surveillance, and on online platforms, blocking uncertified or counterfeit packs and mismatched chargers. Retailers must require third-party documentation, maintain verifiable serial numbers linked to certification files, and support rapid incident reporting. When hazards emerge, recalls and advisories need practical pathways for collection and safe disposal through municipal hazardous waste channels.

Riders need accessible, certified service options when battery packs are damaged, water-intruded, or show early warning signs. As Richey emphasizes, education is part of the engineering solution: proper charging, storage, and use, plus recognition of “key warning signs of battery degradation and or failure,” supported by “recent certifications, warnings, and education.”

Battery safety is not just a marketing claim; it is a system property that must be engineered, verified, and enforced. To prevent fires from making headlines, a baseline with unified standards is necessary, along with providing riders with education and access to certified service and end-of-life collection. When all stakeholders operate under the same rules and face the same consequences, safety stops being a matter of debate.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt36e77ec5607b90bc/692f3eb8494432e501a2fa5b/GettyImages-2217284511.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 16:01:49.385409

The news isn’t surprising, of course, as federal tax credits have disappeared. What is surprising, however, is the rise of gas-powered Mustang sales. In November, Ford sold nearly as many pony cars as it did EVs. I don’t just mean the Mach-E, but all electric Ford offerings combined.

Mustang sales have been slow this year up until this point. The automaker moved just over 1,800 examples in September. But Mustang shoppers turned out in force in November, with Ford selling an impressive 4,207 Mustangs last month.

By comparison, the Blue Oval brand only sold 4,247 EVs. That would be the Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning, and the E-Transit. Each of those models experienced a rapid drop-off last month. But one month only tells part of the story.

Overall, the EV lineup has achieved a greater sales volume year-to-date compared to the Mustang alone. Ford has sold nearly 80,000 electric vehicles in 2025 compared to just over 40,000 Mustangs.

While Mustang sales are still down year-to-date, the November uptick helps close the gap. This time last year, Ford had sold 41,528 Mustangs. In 2025, that figure is 40,870. The electric vehicle drop-off is worsening for Ford, particularly for the Lightning and E-Transit.

Ford moved just 227 electric vans in November. Just a year prior, Ford sold 1,240 examples of the electric Transit in the same month. That’s an 82 percent dip. The Lightning is down 72 percent this month compared to the prior year.

There are a few bright spots in Ford’s sales numbers. The Maverick is doing great. Ford sold 9,883 units in November, compared to 6,899 at the same time last year. Additionally, the Ranger is up 36 percent in November compared to the same month last year. As a whole, the automaker is up over 6 percent year-to-date.

It will be interesting to see if the Mustang finishes the year on a high note. The iconic pony car is experiencing a 1.6 percent decline in sales year-to-date compared to 2024. A strong December, however, could push it in the right direction.

As for the EVs in the family, the drop is likely to continue unless Ford serves up some serious incentives. So if you’re shopping for an EV, keep your eyes peeled for some serious deals as we head deeper into the holiday season.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBXv6k/s1/2026-mustang-ecoboost-with-the-rtr-package.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:00.931859

Five additional projects are under construction after reaching final investment decisions: Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Rio Grande LNG, Woodside Louisiana LNG, Golden Pass LNG and CP2 Phase 1.
Two LNG export projects with a combined 0.6Bcf/d are under construction.
The country stands to benefit economically from serving as a distribution hub while also expanding its influence in global gas markets.
North America’s combined LNG additions through 2029 place the region at the center of global supply growth.","North America is positioned for a major expansion of liquefied natural gas export capacity by the end of the decade, with the United States, Canada and Mexico expected to add more than 17Bcf/d of new liquefaction capacity by 2029, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. The additions would more than double the region’s export capacity and represent more than half of global LNG growth projected through 2029.

The United States remains the primary driver of this expansion. With 15.4Bcf/d of existing capacity, US developers plan to add 13.9Bcf/d between 2025 and 2029 through a series of Gulf Coast projects. Several terminals, including Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 and Corpus Christi Stage III, have begun limited cargo shipments despite not having entered commercial operation. Five additional projects are under construction after reaching final investment decisions: Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Rio Grande LNG, Woodside Louisiana LNG, Golden Pass LNG and CP2 Phase 1. Pipeline construction delays remain a key risk for the timing of future export flows.

Canada is advancing capacity on the Pacific Coast. LNG Canada shipped its first cargo from Train 1 in July 2025 and is expected to reach full capacity of 1.84Bcf/d in 2026. A proposed second phase would double the facility’s capacity after 2029. Two more projects, Woodfibre LNG and Cedar LNG, with a combined capacity of 0.7Bcf/d, are scheduled to begin exports between 2027 and 2028. Their location shortens shipping times to Asian markets compared with exports from the Gulf Coast.

Mexico is emerging as a strategic component of this regional expansion, even though its new capacity is comparatively smaller. Two LNG export projects with a combined 0.6Bcf/d are under construction. The Fast LNG Altamira platform off the East Coast, supplied with US gas through the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline, produced Mexico’s first LNG export cargo in August 2024. On the Pacific Coast, Energía Costa Azul is adding 0.4Bcf/d of capacity, also reliant on US feedgas. Both projects support Mexico’s shift toward becoming a re-export and transit hub for North American natural gas.

Implications of North American LNG Growth for Mexico

Mexico’s geographic position and growing midstream network are central to this shift. The country’s pipeline interconnections with the United States, along with access to both the Gulf and Pacific basins, have strengthened its role as a distribution corridor for regional gas flows. Industry analyses note that Mexico is positioned to expand from a net importer to a commercial platform that can process, store, and re-export natural gas to global markets. This evolution aligns with private-sector interest in leveraging LNG infrastructure to connect US supply with Asian and Pacific demand.

However, the strategy also raises structural questions for Mexico’s domestic energy system. The country remains heavily dependent on US pipeline gas for power generation and industry, and its emerging LNG capacity is not tied to increased local production. Independent analysts warn that large-scale export-oriented buildouts could raise wholesale gas prices and affect electricity affordability for consumers and industrial users, especially if global LNG markets tighten. Growing reliance on cross-border gas flows also places greater importance on regulatory stability, permitting timelines and pipeline reliability.

The broader geopolitical context adds another layer of complexity. US energy diplomacy has increasingly centered on securing long-term LNG influence, encouraging partner countries to sign multi-decade supply contracts. This approach offers supply stability but can lock importing nations into fossil fuel systems with long-term financial commitments. Global analyses indicate that as renewable energy and storage technologies become more cost-competitive, long-term LNG infrastructure could carry opportunity costs for emerging markets. These dynamics are relevant for Mexico, whose energy policy prioritizes sovereignty and domestic production but must also respond to regional market pressures.

Latin America is already grappling with the implications of this shift. Analysts note that new LNG import infrastructure across the region, including in Mexico, can reinforce long-term dependence on fossil fuels and divert investment away from renewable generation and electrification. The United States has also demonstrated willingness to use tariffs to influence energy behavior, as seen in its recent tariff increases on India for continued purchases of Russian energy. Such actions signal the potential for trade and energy policy linkages to affect future decisions in Mexico and across the hemisphere.

Mexico’s role in the regional LNG network is therefore multifaceted. The country stands to benefit economically from serving as a distribution hub while also expanding its influence in global gas markets. At the same time, increased exposure to LNG volatility and structural reliance on imported gas require careful coordination between regulators, state-owned companies and private investors. Future policy decisions will influence whether LNG infrastructure reinforces long-term national strategies or creates new dependencies during a period of rapid global energy transition.

North America’s combined LNG additions through 2029 place the region at the center of global supply growth. The timing and execution of US, Canadian, and Mexican projects will shape international gas markets and regional energy security, with Mexico increasingly positioned at the crossroads of these shifts.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/pexels-photo-13378350%20%281%29.jpeg?h=62c404c8&itok=D7L-z16m,N,,2025-12-02 16:03:49.185600

Automakers are betting on hybrids as they cope with an EV slowdown

Ford sold only 4,247 all-electric vehicles last month.

The loss of key electric-vehicle tax credits is still hurting automakers. That pain could linger, but there's a lone bright spot for the industry: Hybrid sales are surging.

First, the bad news. Ford Motor Co. (F) said Tuesday that it sold just 4,247 all-electric vehicles last month, a nearly 61% decline from the 10,821 units the Detroit automaker delivered in November 2024. That steep hit stems from poorer sales of each of Ford's EV models.

Sales of Ford's most popular EV, the Mustang Mach-E SUV, dropped by more than 49%, while deliveries of the E-Transit van took an 81.7% hit compared with a year earlier. Just 1,006 F-150 Lightning pickup trucks were sold last month, which reflects a 72.4% year-over-year decline as Ford reportedly considers axing the model.

At the same time, Ford is selling more hybrid vehicles. The Detroit automaker has delivered more than 206,000 hybrid vehicles through November, a 19.4% increase compared with the same 11-month period in 2024. It sold 16,301 hybrids last month, up 13.6% from a year before.

Part of that dynamic is because hybrids are typically viewed by consumers as an attractive alternative to expensive all-electric vehicles, since they are more eco-friendly than traditional gas-powered cars. In the wake of the expiration of the U.S. government's $7,500 tax credits for EVs, some automakers are also putting hybrids into focus.

More from MarketWatch: Tesla's Cybertruck is turning 2. It has been a big flop.

""We thought we were going to leapfrog the hybrids, but we can't,"" Kjell Gruner, CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, said at an October Reuters conference when discussing his company's plan to focus on EVs. ""We're all in"" on hybrids, he added.

That's part of why Toyota Motor Corp (JP:7203) plans to invest heavily to boost hybrid production in the U.S. over the next five years. Honda Motor Co. (JP:7267) also plans to double down on hybrids in the U.S., with a platform designed for large-scale vehicles.

Ford is ""prioritizing hybrids across our lineup, including the development of extended-range hybrid options,"" CEO Jim Farley said on his company's third-quarter earnings call.

Hyundai Motor North America said Tuesday that U.S. sales of its Ioniq 5 SUV and Ioniq 6 sedan more than halved in November compared with a year earlier. Kia America Inc. also reported steep declines in sales of its electric SUVs: the EV9 and EV6.

Executives at both companies owned by Hyundai Motor Co. (KR:005380) touted their hybrid lineups. Randy Parker, the chief executive at Hyundai's North American business, also noted that the brand hit a new monthly record for hybrid sales, which grew 42%.

Hochul’s decision to direct NYPA towards advanced nuclear development marks a pivotal moment for New York’s industrial future.","New York has taken a significant step toward reintroducing nuclear energy as a core component of its long-term industrial and economic strategy. In June 2025, Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to pursue development of an advanced nuclear facility, signaling that the state is preparing to meet rapid load growth driven by advanced manufacturing, data centers and electronification. This shift positions New York to compete for the next generation of power-intensive industries, including semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and advanced materials production.

For companies evaluating expansion or site selection in New York, this moment presents a rare opportunity to engage early as the state defines its approach to its advanced nuclear deployment.

New York’s Policy Shift Toward Advanced Nuclear

Gov. Hochul’s directive reflects a broader national and global trend: advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular rectors (SMRs) are moving from concept to commercial readiness. Her public statements frame nuclear power as a tool to:

Attract large, energy-intensive manufacturers to upstate New York;

Strengthen grid reliability as AI, cloud services and electronification accelerate demand;

Provide stable, zero-emission baseload that complements intermittent renewables; and

Position the state as a leader in next-generation clean-energy deployment.

The combination of strong public support from the governor and the NYPA mandate creates a strategic opening for companies with significant future energy needs.

Technology Landscape: Advanced Reactors Move Toward Deployment

Advanced reactors represent a fundamental shift in how nuclear energy can be deployed and financed.

Modular manufacturing: SMRs can be factory-built, shipped and deployed quickly, reducing construction duration and cost risk.

Scalable output: Units can be sized to support industrial campuses, fabrication facilities or data-center clusters.

Enhanced safety: Passive safety systems decrease overheating or meltdown risk.

Grid stability: Advanced nuclear complements renewables and helps address transmission constraints.

These attributes directly align with sectors that require high-reliability and predictable long-term energy costs.

Remaining Barriers: Financing and Regulatory Certainty

Despite technological progress, deployment still faces:

Regulatory complexity, even as NRC modernizes its review process;

High capital costs in early phases; and

Financing gaps for first-of-a-kind projects.

Discussions in Congress regarding a potential national infrastructure financing authority could materially change the landscape. Federal credit support, long-term financing tools and project development incentives would reduce risk and enable deployment in markets like New York.

Strategic Considerations for Manufacturers and Large Load Users

Companies considering New York should evaluate opportunities to engage early in state planning processes. Early action can secure:

Preferential access to nuclear-enabled industrial hubs;

Priority positioning in procurement and interconnection discussions;

Eligibility for state and federal incentive programs;

Opportunities to partner with reactor developers, utilities and public agencies; and

Influence over emerging regulatory, siting and permitting frameworks.

This early engagement can materially affect cost structure, siting certainty and long-term operational competitiveness.

This milestone marks the dawn of a cleaner, more sustainable era in a place deeply rooted in Entergy’s history.

Honoring the past, powering the future

The solar facility site sits adjacent to what was once the iconic Sterlington Station, Entergy’s historic generating plant that first came online in November 1925.

In its earliest days, Sterlington Station was described as a “mighty power giant” for good reason: it started with two turbogenerators producing about 25 MW and was rapidly expanded into one of the largest power plants in the South by the late 1920s. The plant’s location was carefully chosen under the leadership of Entergy founder Harvey Couch for its access to abundant natural gas, water from the nearby Ouachita River, and its strategic position in a growing agricultural and industrial region.

Workers built a whole company town nearby: homes for about 50 families, a school, a church, even a boarding house for single employees. Over the decades, Sterlington Station fueled economic growth across northern Louisiana — and now, a century later, Entergy is writing a powerful new chapter by embracing renewable energy.

“To celebrate the ribbon-cutting of this solar facility at the very site where our roots first took place a century ago is profoundly meaningful,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president CEO. “It’s a testament to how far we’ve come — from the mighty power of Sterlington Station to the clean, sustainable promise of solar power. This is not just an investment in energy, but in Louisiana’s future.”

“The Sterlington Solar Facility stands as a powerful symbol of progress—honoring the legacy of Sterlington Station while embracing a cleaner, more resilient future for Ouachita Parish and all of Louisiana,” said Todd Edsall, president of Power Providers for Black & Veatch. “Our team’s dedication to safety and excellence is reflected in the thousands of incident-free man-hours invested here. This project is more than a source of renewable energy; it’s a catalyst for local jobs, economic opportunity and environmental stewardship. By working together with Entergy and our community partners, we’re helping to build a brighter tomorrow and ensure that Sterlington’s legacy continues to power Louisiana for generations to come.”

A clean-energy investment for the community

The Sterlington Solar Facility was approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission as part of a larger renewable energy build-out: the 49-megawatt solar project is among approximately 225 MW of new facilities greenlit to bolster Entergy Louisiana’s clean energy portfolio.

This development is more than symbolic — it reflects Entergy’s commitment to modernizing its fleet, reducing its carbon footprint and investing in north Louisiana.

“This facility reflects our long-term commitment to modernizing our energy portfolio, reducing emissions, and creating economic opportunity in Ouachita Parish and beyond,” May added. “It’s a legacy honoring the past while shaping the future.”

Economic and environmental benefits

Job creation and local spending: The project contributes to the local economy during construction and operation.

Cleaner energy: As a zero-emission solar resource, the facility helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels and supports Entergy’s sustainability commitments.

Community participation: The Sterlington Solar Facility is part of Entergy Louisiana’s “Geaux Green” (Rider GGO) program, enabling customers to opt into renewable energy and help drive demand for clean power.

Infrastructure resilience: Investing in diversified energy sources strengthens the grid and supports long-term energy reliability.

A legacy renewed

From its humble beginnings — when Harvey Couch built the Sterlington Station to bring affordable power to a growing region — to today’s solar-powered present, the Sterlington community remains at the heart of Entergy’s mission. This ribbon cutting celebrates continuity, innovation, and a shared vision for a cleaner, brighter tomorrow.

1 | Part 1: Breaking down Denver’s Waste No More ordinance

Denver has begun implementing its community-led Waste No More ordinance, sweeping legislation designed to transform the city’s waste collection system toward a circular economy model. Given the compressed timeline between passage and enforcement, city officials established key milestones leading up to the deadline of September 1, 2026.

2 | Ohio start-up turns plastics into high-end furniture

Ohio’s Marble Plastics began, as many good ideas do, from frustration and an unanswered question: Why were small, high-quality plastics slipping through the recycling system untouched? During his early career at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, founder Joseph Klatt often found materials with clear value but no viable match, and those moments pushed him toward a different path. “I wanted to be on the side of actually doing the recycling part myself,” he said.

3 | Canadian PROs join forces to align design guidance

Five Canadian producer responsibility organizations are joining forces to provide clear, consistent guidelines to make packaging design recyclable, with plastics guidance anchored in the Association of Plastic Recyclers Design Guide.

4 | Michigan’s bottle bill at a crossroads

A new report from the University of Michigan warns that the state’s signature 10-cent bottle deposit system is faltering, with redemption rates dropping to their lowest level in decades and structural gaps threatening the program’s ability to support Michigan’s recycling and climate goals.

If there were a dictionary entry for Donald Trump’s catchphrase “drill, baby, drill”, it might be accompanied by a photo of Meg O’Neill.

The American chief executive of Woodside Energy is bringing the Australian oil and gas giant back to her old home. Its $US17.5 billion ($26.71 billion) Louisiana LNG project, just off the Gulf of America/Mexico, is the company’s biggest US investment, and the largest foreign direct investment in Louisiana’s history.

The gas yield is potentially massive: 27 million tonnes a year. That’s basically equivalent to Woodside’s combined Australian operations. Trump’s energy and interior secretaries have praised the project for helping unleash “American energy dominance”. Speaker Mike Johnson appeared virtually at the groundbreaking.

Woodside bought the Driftwood LNG project, as it was then known, last year under Joe Biden, but made a final investment decision in April. If the US is “open for business”, as the president likes to say, Woodside is shaping up as a great customer.

We are bending the rules of this column: O’Neill and I are meeting for brunch, and the restaurant, Ai Fiori, has no real significance other than its convenient location at the Langham Hotel, where she is staying in New York.

We get our orders in quickly: I indulge my Australian sensibilities with avocado toast and a cortado (effectively a piccolo), while O’Neill goes for a salmon bagel and black coffee. Despite seven years in Australia, O’Neill is yet to embrace espresso culture. “I like American-style filtered coffee,” she says. “I brew coffee at home every morning and bring in a thermos.”

O’Neill grew up in the college town of Boulder, Colorado, studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined ExxonMobil. The job took her around the world, including Indonesia, where she split her time between Jakarta and the gas fields of Aceh – and she was there for the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed at least 225,000 people. She has also lived in Texas, Norway and the remote Canadian city St John’s on Newfoundland island.

In 2018, O’Neill joined Woodside as chief operating officer and moved to Perth, becoming its CEO in 2021. She spent most of her career in the closet – “I had a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ approach to who I was at work,” she says – but moving to Australia was the opportunity to come out. She is one of a handful of openly gay people to have led an ASX200 company.

This is O’Neill’s seventh trip back to the US this year. You can see why she might be more comfortable on this side of the Pacific right now. Here, the motto is “drill, baby, drill”, but in Australia, Woodside faces growing scrutiny of its climate and environmental impact.

That includes an embarrassing 58 per cent of shareholders who voted against the company’s climate report at last year’s annual meeting, and a legal challenge to Environment Minister Murray Watt’s decision to approve an extension of Woodside’s North West Shelf LNG project to 2070. The UN’s special rapporteur on climate has just joined the case as an amicus curiae.

It doesn’t rattle O’Neill. She believes the discourse is changing: not just because of the new administration in Washington, but a growing realisation that powering the artificial intelligence era and its energy-hungry data centres will require massive supplies of reliable energy, including from fossil fuels.

She says Trump’s pro-energy, anti-climate dogma is having an impact outside the US, including in Australia.

“It’s challenging some views that have been probably accepted without a lot of question or debate for a few years,” O’Neill says.

“It’s opening the conversation up to one that’s not just, ‘We have to solve climate change and forget about everything else’, to one that says: actually, we have to solve a number of different problems, and the solution may not be perfect for any one of those dimensions.”

O’Neill notes that some European nations are increasingly conscious of losing their manufacturing edge due to the high price of energy compared with the US and China. Indeed, a day after our lunch, Germany confirms plans to subsidise energy prices for heavy industry to bolster its stagnating economy.

In Australia, the Albanese government wants to reduce emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, a target O’Neill calls “highly ambitious”. “I don’t know that the ramifications for society have been fully thought through, or described to the Australian people,” she says.

How would she describe it, then? The lower-hanging fruit is gone, so deeper emissions cuts mean large-scale changes to electricity generation, and dumping coal. “While there are visions of how we might get there, the permitting is not keeping up, the environmental approvals are not keeping up with that,” she says.

“The question of how you maintain reliable power with a heavy renewable input – that has not been addressed. How do you decarbonise heavy industry – has not been addressed. You’re seeing examples of industry flagging that increases in power prices are causing them to rethink the value of their investments. That’s going to be a choice between: do we keep jobs or do we cut emissions? So, Australia [will] have to start to confront some of these questions that Europe is confronting today.”

O’Neill’s salmon bagel arrives deconstructed; she declares it “very tasty”. My avocado toast is fine, but could do with some feta (high standards!). The coffee is mid.

For fossil fuel producers like Woodside, the times are arguably bending in their favour. The political heat has come out of climate change in developed countries, usurped by cost-of-living concerns. While most voters still say climate change is a major threat, the percentage has fallen from its 2018-22 era highs, the Pew Research Centre has found – from Europe to Canada to South Korea and Australia.

In the Australian National University’s recent study on the 2025 election, the proportion of voters who ranked climate change as their most important issue fell to 5 per cent, down from 10 per cent in 2022.

What climate responsibility, if any, does Woodside think it has in this new world? O’Neill adheres strictly to the disputed mantra that gas is a transition fuel that can replace coal rather than displace renewables. She suggests critics of gas are doing the coal lobby’s bidding.

“In Australia, there’s been probably close to 20 years of this anti-gas sentiment, which has at the end of the day resulted in brown coal staying in the mix longer,” she says.

“So, I don’t know if it’s people who are true environmentalists who are driving the anti-gas movement, or if it’s people who are in the coal industry, but the outcome is poor for the environment and it’s going to end up being poor for the consumers.” She points to taxpayer subsidies to keep coal plants open. “It’s not good for anyone.”

But the hugely controversial North West Shelf extension in Western Australia is expected to be responsible for nearly 90 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent a year – more than the annual emissions of some countries – despite conditions imposed by the federal government as part of its approval. Moreover, the extension is only justified if Woodside and its partners ultimately get access to the Browse basin near the pristine Scott Reef, considered the country’s largest untapped conventional gas resource.

Those approvals are ongoing. Still, the Australian government and companies like Woodside are increasingly singing from the same song sheet on environmental laws, complaining that it takes too long to assess major projects. Woodside was ropeable that it took six years for the West Australian government to approve the NWS extension, before the baton was passed to the federal government for a separate assessment.

New laws that passed the federal parliament last week are a mixed bag for gas producers; coal and gas projects are not eligible for new “streamlined” approval pathways following negotiations with the Greens, but they may benefit from moves to eliminate duplication between state and federal assessments.

Part of this is, again, the Trump effect. Australia’s critical minerals deal with the US, agreed in principle during Anthony Albanese’s recent trip to Washington, means getting rare earth projects off the ground quickly. “Drill, baby, drill” is becoming not just a slogan but a policy the US exports to its allies.

O’Neill lays out a stark reality for a global company such as Woodside, which is eyeing a roughly 50-50 revenue split between Australia and the US early next decade. The US has plenty of gas, favourable taxation rates and a relatively quick process for environmental approvals. In Louisiana, the combined state and federal tax rate will be about 25 per cent.

“We have to ask ourselves first and foremost: where is the resource? Australia compares quite favourably to the US [on that],” she says.

“Where do we have confidence we can progress investments at a reasonable pace and generate returns for our shareholders? That’s where we’re fighting some headwinds in Australia.”

There has been speculation Woodside could shift its primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange, but O’Neill says that’s not true. “We intend to maintain our primary listing in Australia.”

Before we leave, I ask O’Neill about life in Perth. She lives in City Beach with her wife, Vicky Hayes, and their teen daughter. Despite its isolation, O’Neill enjoys the relaxed pace and what she calls an “entrepreneurial spirit” that seems to imbue west coast cities.

“I like that feel of a city where people are ready to roll up their sleeves and make a difference,” she says. “It’s got a bit of the wild west to it.”

An NFL fan who backs the Houston Texans, O’Neill has been forcibly acquainted with Australian rules football, courtesy of Woodside’s sponsorship of the Fremantle Dockers. Woodside chairman Richard Goyder is also the outgoing chair of the AFL Commission.

O’Neill says she found the rules “a little fuzzy” and difficult to follow at first, but is now a convert and attends half a dozen matches a year. “I love the game. It’s fast-paced, it’s high scoring, there’s tremendous athleticism. It’s the full package.”

Not that the rules have gotten any easier to understand. “Like, why was this thing a push in the back and that thing was not?”

I could try to explain, but our time is up, and O’Neill is off – more meetings, and more drilling, await.

Demand for electric vehicles has taken a hit after Republican U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill ended the $7,500 tax credits for new EV purchases in October.

Ford also had to contend with the impact of a fire at one of the plants of a key aluminum supplier, hitting production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup.

Sales of Ford's EVs, such as the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning, were down about 61% to 4,247 vehicles in November from last year.

Overall sales of the Detroit automaker in the month slipped nearly 1% to 164,925 units from a year earlier.

Several automakers released November U.S. sales tallies Tuesday, including South Korea's Kia Corp. 000270 , which posted a 2.7% gain, and Honda Motor 7267, which said sales for the month fell 15%, hurt by a shortage of semiconductors.

Sales of Hyundai’s two top-selling EV models in the U.S. – the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 – each fell more than 55% in November. Overall sales slipped 2%.

Randy Parker, Hyundai’s CEO of North America, told Reuters the automaker expected a sharp decline following the tax credit’s expiration. He said some shoppers who may have been interested in a fully electric car have chosen hybrids, sales of which surged 42% for the month.

Parker said Hyundai will continue to push its EVs, and that he wants to get an “unfair share” of sales in the market.

Bernie Moreno said Tuesday.
They went into EVs, and then they convinced the Western world to go into EVs and play their game,"" the freshman lawmaker from Ohio said during an auto industry conference.
Moreno, an auto dealer turned influential policymaker in Washington, has frequently railed against Biden-era moves to set aggressive emissions targets and boost federal support for EVs.
We're playing our game, and we're not going to allow these cars to come into the U.S. market,"" Moreno said.
The lawmaker's remarks came during an on-stage conversation with John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.","Washington — The United States should quit trying to compete with China on electric vehicles, Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno said Tuesday.

""We were ahead of them by a mile, by 10 miles, on the internal combustion engine. They went into EVs, and then they convinced the Western world to go into EVs and play their game,"" the freshman lawmaker from Ohio said during an auto industry conference.

""That was just irrational, dumb policy.""

Moreno, an auto dealer turned influential policymaker in Washington, has frequently railed against Biden-era moves to set aggressive emissions targets and boost federal support for EVs. He again condemned those policies and criticized American allies for allowing Chinese autos inside their borders, even as many in the industry stress that U.S. manufacturers need to find their own success with electric powertrains or risk ceding the future to China.

The senator called out Europe as a warning sign for the United States. Chinese automakers nearly doubled their market share in the European market during the first half of 2025, now exceeding 5% of new vehicle sales per data from JATO Dynamics Ltd.

""You have to be insane to allow the Chinese to take over the auto industry all over the world in a predatory way like that,"" Moreno said, responding to a question about China's excess automotive manufacturing capacity.

""You guys have Chinese infrastructure. You have Chinese automobiles,"" he continued.

""Why would you allow a country to bring in automobiles that would destroy your own industrial sector? That is, they're not here to compete. They're here to destroy. And you have, what, 90 car companies in China, all subsidized by the government, trying to kill each other.

""That's not about healthy competition. It's about taking over the auto industry and making the world dependent on their technology.""

Moreno also celebrated major policy changes during the first year of the Trump administration that cut back on the Biden-era federal push toward EVs. He highlighted congressional action to cancel stringent state-level EV regulations, the zeroing out of fuel economy fines and an end to federal EV subsidies.

Yet more changes are coming, as the Trump administration completed a review last month of key fuel economy standards. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the White House is expected to announce the new regulations Wednesday.

""We're not going to play (China's) game. We're playing our game, and we're not going to allow these cars to come into the U.S. market,"" Moreno said. He also said consumer preferences should guide automakers in the adoption of EVs and other new technologies.

The lawmaker's remarks came during an on-stage conversation with John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. His organization, the top automotive lobbying group in Washington, put on the conference Tuesday, bringing together policymakers, analysts and industry leaders.

Bozzella probed at Moreno's EV stance: ""Do we need to have a balance, though, between supporting our current leadership on internal combustion engines and remaining a cutting-edge technology developer for automotive technologies of the future? Do you worry that we risk becoming sort of an island market if we aren't keeping up with technology investments?""

The senator was unmoved. ""I pushed back on the premise that EV somehow is about innovation,"" he said. ""Electric vehicles were around in 1910. It's not like this new technology.""

""I'm all for innovation, but having a car driven by a 2,000-pound battery is not innovation in my mind. Now, maybe at some point in the future, there's somebody out there that invents something new. Who knows what comes up? But government shouldn't play the role of putting their hands in the scale.""

Many residents felt like Lindsay Sawey, who lives near the proposed site. “They can’t change my mind,” she told The Charlotte Observer during the meeting. “I’m just here so that I can complain.”

The room grew heated as people peppered officials with questions about noise, power bills, water usage and fire safety. Still, not everyone opposed the plan. One man stormed out, calling his neighbors close-minded and yelling: “You won’t listen to the experts.”

It’s a ferocious debate playing out across the Charlotte region, as well as nationally and globally.

Over the past couple of years, the surging use of artificial intelligence fueling apps, websites and other tech has turbocharged the need for rapid expansion of massive data centers to handle the demand. The Carolinas is now seen nationally as a rising hub that’s helping expand that supply.

At this tipping-point moment for the industry here, new and serious concerns have emerged, The Observer found:

The energy needs of 30 data centers that are planned or under construction across the Carolinas, according to one industry report, would more than double the current energy needs in the Carolinas.

Projected demand on the power grid creates a slew of unknowns that North Carolina utility regulators have only recently begun to grapple with publicly.

The lack of public disclosure about the industry’s growth leaves the public in the dark over such basic questions as: how many data centers are in the Charlotte region now, what’s coming next and how much energy will they use?

“Without any transparency, without any sort of central source of information, it’s understandable to be very worried,” said Nick Jimenez with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit.

Understanding data centers

Americans have lived with data centers for the better part of a century. They began in 1945 at the University of Pennsylvania with the advent of computers.

Such centers operated inconspicuously in the Charlotte region for decades. Two data centers on a block on East Trade Street in uptown went virtually unnoticed until one of them filed for expansion in September.

But over the past couple years, their rapidly expanding scale is unprecedented and impossible to ignore.

“AI is really transforming the data center landscape,” said Eric Masanet, professor in sustainability science for emerging technologies at UC Santa Barbara. “A lot of investments are being made, a lot of competitive models being developed, that’s requiring lots and lots of additional AI servers, which require lots and lots of additional data centers.”

Today’s data centers are warehouse-like facilities housing computer servers and components essential for storing, processing and disseminating large amounts of data.

Tech giants such as Google and Amazon own Charlotte-region data centers. Other owners include Digital Realty and Segra, whose sites are built for a single user or as “colocation” sites with space leased to multiple businesses.

Not all data centers are alike. AI-oriented data centers are designed to support complex AI workloads, while traditional data centers focus on general computing tasks.

That means the facilities also operate differently. For example, Segra’s data center near Charlotte airport is cooled using HVAC while bigger data centers proposed for the region, like the one proposed in Matthews, use a closed-loop water system.

Segra, a Charlotte-based fiber network, recently doubled its size to 28,000 square feet at International Airport Drive with a $10 million investment.

Digital Realty, a Texas firm, plans to knock down a pair of century-old office buildings and construct a four-story, 12 MW data center on East Trade Street covering nearly the entire block. It also intends to open what would be the region’s largest data center campus in west Charlotte at 400 MW and 3 million square feet.

Here’s how such power usage breaks down, according to Duke Energy:

100 MW is equivalent to powering 75,000 homes.

1,000 MW equals 1 gigawatt, or GW, equivalent to powering about 750,000 homes.

Apple’s data center in Maiden, spanning 505,000 square feet, is currently the state’s largest data center with capacity for 100 MW. The $1 billion complex elevated the Catawba County area northwest of Charlotte as a data center corridor when it opened in 2010.

Big Tech continues to pour billions of dollars into Carolinas’ data centers to keep up with AI demand.

In February, Apple announced a $500 billion expansion plan for data center capacity and other projects around the U.S., including its North Carolina sites. And in October, Amazon broke ground on a 20-building, $10 billion data center to support its AI needs on 800 acres in Richmond County, between Charlotte and Raleigh.

Data center scale remains blurry

So how many data centers are in the Carolinas? Where are they and how much energy do they use?

No definitive public source can answer that.

Companies such as Chicago-based real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield offer some insight by combining information from multiple public and private entities. The Carolinas, counted as one group, appeared as an emerging market for the first time in the firm’s annual America’s Data Center Update list.

There are 67 data centers operating in the Carolinas, according to the report released in September. Another 26 — many substantially bigger than existing ones — are planned and four are under construction.

The Charlotte region, including Rock Hill, accounts for more than half of the existing data centers with 38, said John McWilliams, head of data center insights at Cushman & Wakefield. The region also has one center under construction and another 22 planned.

A quarter of the centers under construction in the Carolinas are in the Charlotte area, McWilliams said.

All told, the Carolinas has projects requiring a combined 400 MW under construction and another 2.7 gigawatts for planned projects, McWilliams said. That’s nearly double the current energy needs in the Carolinas.

Another company examining growth, Datacentermap.com, tracks thousands of facilities and offers energy capacity statistics on some sites. But company founder Sune Christesen, who provided the Observer with the firm’s data, cautioned that the company wasn’t confident about the stage of development each center was in as changes are hard to track.

When the Observer set out to verify Datacentermap.com data, most companies on its list responded, but not all shared basic information.

For instance, Microsoft refused to confirm the project status of the data centers planned or under construction near Hickory, Maiden and Roxboro near Durham, despite having posts about the ones in the Hickory and Maiden markets on its website.

Other local projects also have been shrouded in secrecy.

Residents frustrated with data center approval

On Nov. 7, 2022, just over the state line from Charlotte, York County Council members in South Carolina unanimously approved a seemingly routine 27-item consent agenda. It included a plan little noticed at the time: the first step for the county selling 173 acres in the Lake Wylie area.

A week later, the board held a special meeting for second approval on what it now said was an economic development deal dubbed “Project Cobra.” The meeting lasted all of two minutes.

The council unanimously approved the sale the following week, with no mention of what “Project Cobra” entailed.

That picture began to get clearer seven months later. In June 2023, York officials said the project and a related incentives deal involved a whopping billion-dollar investment for a new data center — the largest economic investment in county history.

As is common in such development work, the name of the company still was not publicly revealed. But the Observer’s sister paper, The Herald in Rock Hill, soon sussed out that a Kansas data center firm called QTS was behind the deal.

A September 2023 county agenda officially disclosed that “Project Cobra” was for QTS, and the council unanimously approved the data center incentives deal.

QTS is investing $1 billion to build a nearly 5.3 million-square-foot data center campus on 400 acres in the Lake Wylie area. County leaders later approved allowing the campus to be built 80 feet high, 20 feet taller than other industrial or commercial properties.

But QTS said it does not release expected megawatts totals of its data centers.

More than three years after the county first referenced “Project Cobra,” and over two years after York County revealed who was behind the project, QTS held an informal community meet-and-greet Nov. 4 in Lake Wylie.

“This has been secretive like I’ve never seen,” one of the residents said, as a group of people huddled around QTS Development Program Manager Ryan Wehmann, bombarding him with questions.

Stacy Armstrong agreed. “We could not win because we didn’t know it was coming,” said Armstrong, whose Wedgefield Drive home borders the data center construction site.

Armstrong carried an inch-plus-thick notebook of documents and illustrations from research she’d done on the QTS plans, along with questions about potential risks from light pollution, noise levels and electric bill hikes.

“And the more we ask, the less scientific data we get,” Armstrong said. “ I have a ton of questions. I have less answers.”

She was about to undertake a major house renovation, but no more. Now, she’s planning to move.

Power demand impact

Public sector and nonprofit organizations are tuning in to the implications of this tech-sector boom.

In August, Gov. Josh Stein created the North Carolina Energy Policy Task Force, noting the need to power data centers amid the emergence of AI, among other trends, prompted new questions about how to “maintain an adequate, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity supply”.

And in October, the North Carolina Utilities Commission hosted a conference to study how to fairly and efficiently manage the growing electricity demand.

Key concerns included whether the power grid can handle the new demand, whether existing customers will have to pay more and what energy companies would do if they put resources into a big expansion only for the project to fall through.

The Carolinas risk power outages during winter storms in the mornings and evenings, said Stony Martin, manager of reliability, models and studies at the Southeastern Electric Reliability Corp. The nonprofit is a watchdog for the electric grid in the southeastern and central U.S.

Martin said at the conference that “the risk will only get worse” with expected demand from major energy customers like data centers.

Duke Energy is aware of the concerns.

The Charlotte-based utility giant assesses each high-demand proposal to determine if it’s feasible with the existing power grid, if it would require updates and whether the location is feasible, Duke Energy spokesman Garrett Poorman said.

Duke Energy holds these customers to minimum billing requirements and other terms to ensure they “pay their fair share,” Poorman said.

And for the first time, Duke Energy published a report this year tracking forecasted growth from major energy users like data centers.

It counted 35 large-electric-load projects in the advanced planning stages in the Carolinas. From January 2024 to last spring, the number of projects didn’t change, but the report stated their forecasted energy needs grew by 50%.

While the report doesn’t specify how many are data centers, it’s clear that their growth is transforming the Carolinas.

“It’s not the same market that existed to serve local demand anymore,” Cushman & Wakefield’s McWilliams said. “It’s really growing into a regional player, and potentially has the opportunity to grow into a global player as well.”

A data center ‘evolution’ in the Carolinas

North Carolina and South Carolina have become an industry focal point as operators seek alternatives to “Data Center Alley” Virginia and, more recently, Atlanta, experts say.

“It was only a matter of time before the Carolinas began to experience the surge in activity seen over the past year,” Cushman & Wakefield’s latest annual report said. “Centrally located on the East Coast, the region boasts strong power infrastructure, robust fiber connectivity and favorable deal economics.”

The Charlotte area stands at the core of the Carolinas’ boom, McWilliams said.

Most of the current construction activity covers hyperscale sites by major tech companies. Hyperscale data centers are large-scale facilities that can rapidly handle massive computing power and data storage, typically consuming more than 50 MW annually.

But there’s a shift underway in the Charlotte region. It features more wholesale colocation sites by providers like Digital Realty.

Many colocation centers in the Carolinas, with an average facility size under 5 MW, are not equipped to meet the heavy demands of hyperscalers that now average 73 MW, according to Cushman & Wakefield’s report. “This market is at the beginning of its evolution,” the report stated, “and will soon host a growing hyperscale presence.”

Duke Energy and data centers

As the sector keeps growing, and residents keep pressing for more information, power utilities really are the only ones with the answers, according to CBRE. The commercial real estate services firm tracks data center growth within leasable space, but not the big, owner-operated facilities.

That brought us back to Duke Energy.

Data center developers trying to locate here sign contracts with Duke Energy committing to pay for certain amounts of energy before they launch. Duke Energy does not make the details of those agreements public, including the company that signed.

At the conference, both Sierra Club climate and energy advisor Jeremy Fisher and the Data Center Coalition’s director of energy policy Lucas Fykes, told utilities commissioners that they want to see more transparency in data center development planning.

“By the time we’re looking at a small number of customers that have the potential to consume more than 20% of the utility’s energy consumption, we need to start ... wondering what the implications are for other customers,” Fisher said.

Duke Energy ensures that data centers pay the “full cost of the infrastructure required to serve them, so those costs aren’t passed on to residential customers,” Poorman told the Observer.

Not everyone’s convinced.

Speaking at the utilities conference, Fisher said existing energy customers bear the brunt of the risk of rising electricity costs as data centers plan to move in.

More data center worries

It’s crucial to manage data center development to prevent transferring costs to other customers and to avoid worsening climate impact, said Jimenez, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.

In northern Virginia, data centers already are being blamed for higher utility bills.

Fisher cited a 2024 Virginia legislature study, which concluded that data center energy demands would likely increase costs for the typical Dominion Energy customer by $14 to $37 a month by 2040. Dominion is proposing a new rate class for utility customers that use more than 25 MW.

Poorman told the Observer that comparing North Carolina and Virginia’s electricity systems is “apples to oranges” because they are regulated differently, which presents key differences in how resources are planned and rates are set.

In North Carolina, the Power Bill Reduction Act became law in July. It allows Duke Energy to charge customers for new power plants, such as gas and nuclear, before construction is complete to keep up with growing energy needs, including from data centers.

Stein had vetoed the bill, which was overridden by state lawmakers. The governor cited a bill analysis by N.C. State University researchers that showed it could cost North Carolina ratepayers up to $23 billion through 2050 due to higher fuel costs, the News & Observer reported.

Duke Energy has argued the changes will allow it to lower the price paid by customers for new generation facilities over a project’s lifetime by decreasing financing costs, and that legislators have cited an overall cost savings of as much as $15 billion.

Other concerns about hyperscale data centers in communities around Charlotte and the rest of the country include:

Water consumption: Data centers require lots of water to cool their systems. A single center can consume up to 5 million gallons a day, or enough daily drinking water for 50,000 households or farms, according to a University of Tulsa in Oklahoma report.

Land use and visual impact: These facilities are typically large, utilitarian buildings surrounded by security fences that cover large plots of land that some critics say could be better used.

Limited job creation: While data center construction provides many jobs, the long-term workforce is often small, typically several dozen or so.

‘What Matthews is all about’

While some Charlotte-area communities have embraced new centers, others, like Statesville and Mooresville, remain resistant.

Back in Matthews, neighbors were adamant they wanted nothing to do with a data center. Such a development isn’t as good a fit for the town as several hundred homes would be, resident Jim Dedmon said at the October meeting.

“You’re helping improve the town with families, not data centers,” he said. “You’re building community. That’s what Matthews is all about.”

Six days after that meeting, developers Engineered Land Solutions and Crosland Southeast withdrew the rezoning request for the project.

Matthews residents celebrated the news. Developers withdrew the request due to “overwhelming public distaste” for it, Mayor John Higdon said, and he doubted they’d resubmit it.

But despite all the unanswered questions and concerns enveloping similar projects, experts say one thing remains certain: more data centers are coming to the Carolinas.

It’s possible.

Energy leaders in 10 southern states, including Kentucky, are working to launch the Southeast Energy Resilience Accelerator, or SERA, group — an initiative responding to funding opportunities currently being afforded by the Economic Development Administration.

If approved at the regional, state and federal levels, this part of Kentucky might have the option to be involved.

According to the October 2025 Kentucky eClearinghouse Report, which is provided as a monthly update through the Pennyrile Area Development District, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation is beseeching Commonwealth officials to procure at least $5 million in federal appropriations — with a $1.25 million applicant buy-in — in order to:

+ Create a collaboration between the Southeast Hydrogen Energy Alliance, E4 Carolinas, several regional energy trade associations and three Georgia Tech interdisciplinary research institutes: the Strategic Energy Institute, the Advanced Technology Development Center and the Manufacturing Institute, in hopes of responding to an Economic Development Administration funding opportunity.

+ And, then, run no less than a 30-month program that could discover avenues forward in sustainable energies, and their ultimate production and distribution.

Sources indicate that initial funding, again, if approved, would come from the EDA’s FY 2025 Disaster Supplemental Implementation Path, with longer-term support expected from industry sponsors.

SERA would then serve 544 FEMA-designated disaster counties in the 2022-24 window across these 10 southeastern states — focusing on nuclear, hydrogen and similar resilient energy technologies capable of on-site fuel storage, micro-grid support or mobile deployment.

For Kentucky and the News Edge listening area, this would include Caldwell, Christian, Crittenden, Hopkins, Lyon, Logan, Muhlenberg, Todd and Trigg counties.

This is all building on prior federal funding of two completed regional studies — “The Economic Impact of the Nuclear Industry in the Southeast United States” and “The Green Hydrogen Value Chain in the Southeast United States” — which, among many insights, notes that:

+ Hydrogen production units are located in the Southeast U.S.— primarily in Calvert City and Catlettsburg in Kentucky; Decatur, McIntosh and Saraland in Alabama; and the country has other active production units in Georgia, West Virginia, Florida and North Carolina.

+ As of 2020, Kentucky already has a varied and well-respected renewable energy profile, with 10 dams producing 7% of the state’s electricity generation, 10% of green generation came from biomass, solar accounted for 0.2% of all electricity provided, and biofuels come from two ethanol plants.

+ Christian County has a hydrogen demand of 4,000 to 10,000 kilograms per square kilometer per year.

+ The Tennessee Valley Authority already has two nuclear plants in its profile, capable of producing no less than a combined 4,800 megawatts of power: Sequoyah in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, and Watts Bar in Spring City, Tennessee. Construction of a third unit, a small modular reactor near the Clinch River in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, is currently underway.

+ And the top 10 nuclear firms in the southeast are Japan’s Mitsubishi Power, London’s Rolls-Royce SMR, Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric, Seattle’s Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp, Boston’s General Electric, Kansas City’s Burns & McDonnell, Japan’s Toshiba Energy Systems, Germany’s Siemens Energy, Alameda’s Kairos Power and Lynchburg’s BWX Technologies.

Specific inventories have reportedly identified more than 180 interested power companies, and nearly 20 utilities, that are willing to help SERA define resilience needs, mentor startups and host demonstrations, and SERA, if given the go ahead, will be looking to recruit early- to growth-stage companies in these 500-plus counties to be ready for “an intensive acceleration process,” in order to “support commercialization and foster partnerships that enhance disaster resilience, diversify local economies, and generate new jobs and investment.”

In a written statement to the News Edge, Southeast Hydrogen Energy Alliance Advisor David A. Doctor said the project remains in the application review stage with the EDA — which typically operates on a 90-day review cycle.

However, he noted that with the federal government being closed for six weeks, and the EDA needing to sort through its project backlog, expectations are the review “takes a bit longer.”

Senior executives from GM, Ford, and Stellantis plan to attend the White House announcement, signaling critical industry support for the policy shift.

This action formally resets the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, replacing stringent targets set under President Biden. The previous rules would have required automakers to achieve an average fleet efficiency of roughly 50 miles per gallon by the 2031 model year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which oversees CAFE standards, declared in June that the prior administration improperly considered electric vehicles when setting future requirements. The new rule establishes a legal foundation for standards that exclude such considerations.

The rollback represents the latest victory in President Trump's concerted campaign against regulations he has labeled an ""EV mandate."" His administration has already eliminated federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchasers and moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority to set its own, stricter tailpipe emissions limits. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency took the foundational step of proposing to rescind the 2009 ""endangerment finding,"" the determination that greenhouse gases harm public health, which underpins federal regulation of vehicle emissions.

Legal experts note that this aggressive federal retreat could ironically empower states. Ann Carlson, a former NHTSA official and UCLA law professor, argues that if the federal government determines greenhouse gases are not covered by the Clean Air Act, ""then California could presumably regulate them - and so could every other state."" California is already preparing for this conflict, with its air board launching a multi-year process to develop its own post-Trump vehicle emission rules, targeting a vote in 2027.

The administration’s push guarantees a protracted legal and regulatory battle. California, along with a coalition of other states, has already sued the administration over the revocation of its waivers. The outcome will determine whether a single national standard prevails or the country fractures into a patchwork of state rules, shaping the automotive market and environmental policy for years to come.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gas-pump.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:21.603912

Just months ago, he made headlines by betting against the AI frenzy, snapping up put options on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). Those moves signaled his skepticism toward the tech sector’s explosive growth, driven by hype over artificial intelligence.

Now, Burry has turned his gaze to another high-flyer: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In a recent Substack post, he labeled the electric vehicle giant “ridiculously overvalued,” unveiling a fresh short position. This isn’t Burry’s first dance with Tesla — he held a $530 million bearish bet in 2021 — but it underscores his view that the stock’s surge defies fundamentals amid intensifying competition and questionable leadership decisions.

Decoding Burry’s Tesla Critique

Burry’s takedown of Tesla hinges on a core issue: its sky-high valuation. With shares trading around $430 and a market cap exceeding $1.4 trillion, Tesla commands a price-to-earnings multiple of over 287 times trailing earnings — dwarfing traditional automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM), which hover below 15.

Burry argues this premium stems from relentless optimism among investors, who keep pivoting narratives to justify the price. “Tesla’s market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time,” he wrote bluntly. He points to the “Elon cult” — die-hard fans who championed electric cars until rivals like BYD and legacy players ramped up, then shifted to autonomous driving dreams, and now hype humanoid robots like Optimus. But Burry warns competition will inevitably erode these edges, as it has Tesla’s 41% U.S. EV market share.

Error loading chart data: Turnstile challenge failed: 600010

The Musk Factor Risk

No Burry critique lands without a jab at leadership, and Elon Musk draws sharp fire here. Burry slams Musk’s newly approved $1 trillion compensation package as a massive dilution threat, exacerbating Tesla’s already aggressive stock-based pay. He calculates the company hands out about 3.6% of shares annually to employees, with zero buybacks to counter the erosion.

This practice, Burry contends, inflates the share count without proportional value creation, punishing long-term holders. Musk’s package, tied to ambitious performance milestones, could flood the market with billions more shares if met — further pressuring the stock. Burry’s disdain echoes his broader beef with tech CEOs who prioritize spectacle over shareholder returns, likening Tesla’s trajectory to a bubble waiting to pop.

This short revives Burry’s 2021 Tesla wager, which he cashed out quickly as “just a trade.” Today, it fits his pattern of targeting frothy tech names. After shorting Nvidia and Palantir on AI overhyping and dilution parallels, Burry deregistered his Scion Asset Management hedge fund last month to go independent via Substack. There, he dissects overvaluations unfiltered, framing Tesla as exhibit A in a market detached from reality. At nearly 200 times forward profits, the stock leaves little margin for error if growth falters.

Key Takeaway

Burry’s Tesla short pits him squarely against bullish titans like Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, who forecasts $2,000 shares by 2027 on robotaxi and AI dominance, or Ron Baron, who touts Tesla’s moat in energy and autonomy.

Wood’s optimism hinges on exponential tech adoption, while Burry bets on mean reversion through competition and economics. History favors Burry, but Tesla’s cult-like following and Musk’s execution track record (SpaceX, xAI, The Boring Company) give bulls ammunition. Still, at these multiples, a correction feels probable if EV demand softens further or robots underdeliver.

For investors, don’t pick sides blindly. Diversify beyond Tesla, eye put options for downside protection, or trim exposure if shares hit resistance near $450. In volatile times, Burry’s caution provides an important reminder: Valuations matter more than visions.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry23-XRT.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 14:02:40.712954

County commissioners in 2024 also authorized Equitrans Midstream to survey Harrison County-owned land for a natural gas pipeline to the site.

It is not clear if other partners have any financial stake in the project, which has received state and local incentives, including a 30-year county exemption from paying local property taxes.

Plant site preparation, including controlled blasting, is underway, with operations expected to begin by 2027, said Blackstone, adding that it expected to create about 500 jobs during construction. A Blackstone spokesperson declined to respond to an ENR query on contractors selected for the project.

Blackstone acquired last year a majority stake in Plano, Texas-based Westwood Professional Services Inc., an engineering firm described as specializing in wind and solar energy, energy storage, power delivery, EV infrastructure, public infrastructure projects and other construction. The firm ranks at No. 77 on ENR's Top Design Firms list, reporting $412.8 million in 2024 revenue, about 44% in the power sector and 39% in building construction. Dean Palumbo, a former Stantec senior vice president, was named in August as Westwood chief operating officer.

Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, a Virginia-based co-op with about 1.5 million customers through its 11 member-owner firms in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, including data centers and other industrial facilities, agreed in July to buy the power that will be generated by the Wolf Summit plant.

“Helping meet the rising demand for electricity from AI and other areas is among our highest conviction investment themes at Blackstone,” said Bilal Khan, a Blackstone senior managing director, in a statement.

Originally proposed in 2017 by the Energy Solutions Consortium as a 579-MW combined-cycle plant and a $615-million investment, project development halted following a lawsuit over air permits and financing issues, according to local media reports. The consortium withdrew from the project. Wolf Summit Energy, a subsidiary of General Electric, subsequently revived and expanded the project in 2023. The Blackstone spokesperson also declined to say if the plant will be co-located with a data center or if it is being designed to also use hydrogen-blended fuel.

Blackstone, based in New York City, is considered the largest investor in global data centers and AI infrastructure, according to a ranking by Data Centre, an online sector publication. The company also announced in September its $1-billion acquisition of Hill Top Energy Center, a 620-MW gas-fired power plant in Pennsylvania, and a similarly valued purchase in January of Potomac Energy Center, a 774-MW gas-fired power plant in Virginia.

FORT WAYNE — The interim president of the Fort Wayne Common Council is urging Google to meet with residents as scrutiny grows over a new air permit tied to the company’s $2 billion data center now under construction on the city’s southeast side.

Google has asked the Indiana Department of Environmental Management for permission to install 179 diesel backup generators at the site. The request has prompted concerns from residents who fear possible health, noise and pollution impacts. Interim council president Geoff Paddock outlined those worries in a letter to the agency on Wednesday, Nov. 26 and said he has heard from numerous constituents since the application became public.

Paddock noted that when the council approved rezoning for the property in late 2023, officials did not raise the issue of large-scale backup power needs. He said the project had been described as a quiet operation with minimal impact on surrounding neighborhoods.

The data center was first linked to Google in January 2024 after operating under the name Project Zodiac. The company initially planned an $845 million investment, which expanded to $2 billion in April.

The development is expected to add about 200 jobs over several years.

Paddock has asked IDEM to ensure the company pursues the safest and most efficient backup energy options and uses top pollution control practices.

Additionally, Triodos Bank is campaigning for energy-efficient housing and bio-based building standards.","Triodos Bank has unveiled its first integrated Climate & Nature Strategy, announcing a comprehensive approach to accelerate the energy transition, reduce financed emissions and increase investment in nature-based solutions.

The Triodos Bank energy transition strategy, ‘Dare to Act. Now.’, sets out measurable targets to drive climate and biodiversity action by 2030.

Triodos Bank’s new four-pillar strategy marks the first time the bank has unified its climate and biodiversity ambitions.

The plan includes a commitment to cut absolute financed emissions by at least 42% by 2030, up from the 32% target set in 2022.

The focus is on three key activities that together account for 90% of the bank’s emissions footprint: business loans, mortgages, and listed equities and bonds managed by Triodos Investment Management.

Another pillar of the Triodos Bank energy transition strategy is the financing of 275 energy transition projects over the next five years. The bank aims to support next-generation, decentralised and community-led solutions, building on its “strong track record” in renewable energy finance.

The deal-count target is designed to ensure that finance reaches not only large utilities but also cooperatives, innovators and smaller community-led initiatives that often face challenges in accessing mainstream capital.

In addition to the energy transition targets, Triodos Bank plans to channel €500m ($580.39m) into high-integrity, nature-based solutions (NbS) by 2030. These projects are intended to deliver measurable ecological and social benefits, addressing both climate and biodiversity challenges together.

From 2026, the bank will begin reporting on its progress towards this investment goal, as well as on the positive biodiversity impacts of its financed projects. The aim is to provide greater transparency on how investments in NbS contribute tangible benefits for biodiversity.

Triodos Bank’s fourth strategy includes a strong advocacy component. The bank has called for systemic change in the financial sector.

It has stated that banks are still directing €650bn annually into fossil fuels, which sustains dependency on non-renewable energy sources.

The bank is advocating for international agreements such as the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to phase out fossil fuels and create robust frameworks for high-integrity NbS.

Additionally, Triodos Bank is campaigning for energy-efficient housing and bio-based building standards.

As part of its advocacy, Triodos Bank has sought for binding rules including mandatory fossil-phase-out pathways for all banks; required short-term emissions reduction targets for 2030–35, with transparent action plans; alignment of financial regulation with the Paris Agreement and adherence to 1.5°C reduction pathways; separate targets for emissions reduction and carbon removal; and robust integrity standards for nature-based solutions.

Triodos Bank CEO Marcel Zuidam emphasised the interconnectedness of climate change and biodiversity loss, stating: “Climate change and biodiversity loss are not separate crises. They are deeply interconnected. Restoring ecosystems is essential to stabilising the climate, and climate action must protect biodiversity. Our strategy is about real reductions, real solutions and real leadership.

“We invite the financial sector to join us in embracing long-term well-being and taking action for a hopeful future. Together, we can drive the systemic change needed to stay within planetary boundaries. This means aligning financial flows with the Paris Agreement, investing in nature restoration and a clear road map to end the financing of the fossil fuel industry.”

U.S. electricity customers experienced an average of 11 hours of power outages in 2024, nearly twice as many as the annual average across the previous decade, according to a new report from the Energy Information Administration.

Hurricanes accounted for 80% of those lost hours, with most of last year’s outages resulting from major weather events like hurricanes Beryl, Helene and Milton, EIA said in the report released Monday.

“Interruptions attributed to major events averaged nearly nine hours in 2024, compared with an average of nearly four hours per year in 2014 through 2023,” EIA said. “Service interruptions that aren’t triggered by major events routinely average about two hours per year.”

Customers in South Carolina were significant outliers in terms of outage duration, the report said, experiencing an average of 53 hours of outages in 2024. Much of this was due to last September’s Hurricane Helene, which left 1.2 million customers in South Carolina without electricity.

The report appears to build on a growing body of evidence that extreme weather is taking a heavier toll on the electric power system in parts of the country. In October, JD Power released a report that found the average length of the longest outages are getting longer and concluded that disasters have become a “fact of life” for many utility customers.

Helene, in particular, caused severe damage to utility systems in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.

Duke Energy said after the hurricane that transmission infrastructure in upstate South Carolina “was severely damaged and, in many cases, destroyed” and would need to be entirely rebuilt.

Three days after the hurricane struck, 900,000 Duke customers remained without power across North Carolina and South Carolina, the utility said. Following hurricanes Helene and Milton, Duke reported needing to replace around 16,000 transformers — more transformers than utilities generally require in an entire year, WoodMac Senior Analyst Ben Boucher said in February.

South Carolina, along with North Carolina and Florida, “dealt with strong winds and flooding from Hurricane Helene that affected transmission and distribution power lines as well as substations leading to prolonged power outages,” EIA said. The following month, Hurricane Milton “left 3.4 million customers in Florida without power,” it added.

“In contrast, customers in states such as Arizona, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Massachusetts experienced, on average, less than two hours of service interruptions in 2024,” EIA said

Project Overview

We’re seeking approval to construct and operate a 76-megawatt alternating current (MWac) utility-scale solar power center and associated facilities in Darlington and Chesterfield counties, S.C. The associated facilities will include a new 230-kilovolt (kV) solar generation substation and a new 230-kV generation tie line spanning approximately 225 to 250 feet between the solar generation substation and the existing Darlington power plant’s 230-kV switching station (the point of interconnection).

Construction is expected to begin in late 2026 or early 2027. The facility will provide fuel-free power and capacity to meet the growing needs of the Pee Dee region of South Carolina.

Transitioning to cleaner energy sources, while also meeting growing energy needs, requires a diverse mix of resources to help ensure continued reliability as older plants are retired. As energy needs continue to grow significantly, Duke Energy must invest in new infrastructure to keep jobs and investment coming to South Carolina.

We are using an “all-of-the-above approach” that incorporates renewables like solar, next-generation and existing nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric sources. This diverse mix will help Duke Energy meet customer expectations for cleaner energy while also reliably powering communities across the state.

Surprise funding will help smaller agencies with senior mobile food programs, weekend backpack efforts, food pantries, veteran programs

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

GREENVILLE, S.C., Dec. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are wrapping up a monthlong initiative to support organizations that address food deserts, insecurities and inequities across South Carolina by announcing nearly $275,000 in surprise microgrants and contributions to community organizations across the state.

The big picture: The announcement wraps up a monthlong campaign of financial support to and employee volunteerism with organizations in South Carolina that fight hunger across the state. These include programs that distribute food boxes, fill backpacks for weekend food programs for students, provide help to veterans and senior mobile meal programs, among other feeding initiatives.

In total, the initiative provided more than $600,000 to critical community partners that do this incredible work, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina, https://sc211.org/One SC Fund and AIM, among many others.

The microgrants and contributions were not solicited by the receiving organizations. The 'surcee' funding opportunities recognize the important gaps these typically smaller agencies fill in the neighborhoods they serve. A complete list of recipients can be found here.

Why it matters: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That's 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

What they're saying

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""If you grew up in South Carolina, you are likely familiar with a 'surcee' – a small, unexpected gift. Giving Tuesday is the perfect opportunity to give a little something extra and highlight the great work these organizations do throughout the year to help keep our friends and neighbors from going hungry.""

Mark Champagne, executive director, Sumter United Ministries: ""Thanks to the generosity of the Duke Energy Foundation's $5,000 grant, we will be able to place food into the hands of neighbors who are struggling more than I've seen in many years. As requests continue to rise and our shelves grow thin, this gift brings real hope at a time when our community truly needs it.""

Traci H. Kennedy, executive director, TOTAL Ministries: ""We so appreciate everything Duke Energy Foundation does for TOTAL Ministries. The grant is making an immediate and meaningful difference, allowing us to meet rising needs and care for families who are struggling the most.""

Melinda Waddell, executive director, The Manna House: ""The support from Duke Energy for our mission to create a hunger-free Florence allows us to continue to provide hot, healthy, nutritious meals to our clients. With more than 100,000 individual meals served in 2024, we truly appreciate their dedication and commitment to our neighbors and community.""

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

Under the EPA’s current Regional Haze Rule, states must submit state implementation plans every 10 years to protect visibility in treasured national parks – like Yosemite, Acadia, Shenandoah, and Rocky Mountains – and wilderness areas – like Sipsey, Joyce Kilmer, Dolly Sods, and Boundary Waters Canoe Area – to demonstrate continued, reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal of the Clean Air Act. The EPA intends to weaken the rule, and as a first step, issued a public comment period for its advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. A second public comment period on the rulemaking is expected in early 2026.

“The Regional Haze Rule is a time-tested, effective program that requires federal and state agencies, federal land managers, and stakeholders to work together to restore clear skies in 156 national parks and wilderness areas (Class I areas). The Haze Rule has delivered significant cost-effective clean air benefits to national parks, wilderness areas and communities across the nation in the past 15 years — over 1.4 million tons of visibility impairing pollution has been reduced, improving scenic views and making air healthier to breathe across the nation,” reads the sign-on letter. “But there is still a lot of work to do as visitors regularly miss out on over 50 miles of scenic views and experience unhealthy air when visiting these treasured places.”

In both letters, the groups expressed concern that EPA’s deregulatory direction, as stated by Administrator Lee Zeldin in March 2025 and in Project 2025, will run contrary to the visibility goals of the Clean Air Act, weaken the Regional Haze Rule, and undermine years of progress toward cleaner air in parks and wilderness areas. The groups reject any efforts by the EPA to weaken the effectiveness of the rule, including by allowing states to avoid requiring pollution control systems, avoid identifying emissions reduction measures, and avoid developing regular regional haze plans altogether.

“Many sources of air pollution that were expected to retire, clean up, or otherwise reduce emissions can no longer be assumed to be on that same course given dramatic changes in the last year to clean air policies, facility or pollution control operations, and pollution exemptions granted by presidential decree,” reads the sign-on letter. “Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas. We must ensure continued reductions in haze pollution in the years and decades to come to benefit these treasured places and our communities.”

The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, Earthjustice, National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club, and Southern Environmental Law Center also expressed concerns about the timing of the comment period due to the government shutdown, which prevented affected agencies like the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service from providing adequate feedback. The EPA ignored the groups’ request for a comment period extension.

That’s where Arkansas is leading the way, transforming recycled inputs into steel, plastics and paper products that power modern manufacturing in addition to helping build a circular economy that keeps critical resources at home and North American supply chains strong.

Circularity ensures yesterday’s waste is reintegrated while reducing dependence on mined ore or new, unused plastics shipped across oceans.

Added benefits include shortened supply lines, slashed transportation costs as well as emissions, and diminished exposure to global market shocks.

It’s also a workforce success story: sustaining thousands of high-wage jobs while ensuring the materials needed for cars, bridges, appliances and packaging remain readily available.

Recycling is not just good environmental policy –– it’s supply chain resiliency in action.

As old buildings and bridges are torn down to make way for new construction, and automobiles and washing machines reach their end of life, Arkansas recyclers accumulate and process them to recover high-quality ferrous metals. The result is a product that meets the same stringent performance standards as brand new steel made from mined ore.

Today, more than 70 percent of the steel forged in the U.S. is manufactured with recycled materials, and Arkansas is at the center of this story. Nucor’s mills in Mississippi County — one of the leading steel-producing counties in the nation — transform recycled materials into the steel that builds our cars and bridges.

The Natural State is also home to national leaders in plastics recycling. Revolution, one of the largest recyclers and manufacturers of agricultural plastics in North America, has a recycling hub in Stuttgart and manufacturing operations in Little Rock that have helped reutilize over 1 billion pounds of plastics. In Arkansas, it converts used farm plastics into new products like polytube and trashcan liners made with the highest certified post-consumer resin in the industry. Revolution’s success demonstrates how circularity drives economic growth.

That same story holds true for the simple cardboard box, one of the most widely recycled materials in America. A fixture of our modern economy, almost every product sold domestically is at some point contained in cardboard.

Corrugated cardboard is one of the most recyclable materials in use today. With six sustainable packaging facilities in Arkansas, International Paper plays a pivotal role in creating new corrugated packaging by reusing more than 5 million tons of recycled fiber annually to turn yesterday’s boxes, newspapers and office paper into sustainable packaging.

Since 2013, International Paper has increased its recovery rate of corrugated packaging by 93 percent and its overall recovery rate by 40 percent, removing unwanted waste, extending the lifespan of our fiber and timber resources, and creating well-paying jobs for Arkansans.

Seeing the success of the recycled materials industry in the Natural State has directly informed my policy priorities in the U.S. Senate.

Whether passing pro-growth and investment policies like tax reform or leading the Senate Recycling Caucus to promote awareness around this evolving sector, I am proud to work in bipartisan fashion and advance commonsense ideas. This year, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously advanced my legislation, the Steward Act, to strengthen voluntary standardized data collection efforts that help Arkansas manufacturers make informed business decisions while discerning industry trends.

The circular economy plays a small role in each of our lives. From the bridges we drive across to the appliances we replace and cardboard boxes we break down, what is recycled today becomes the durable materials we rely on tomorrow. I would encourage other states to follow Arkansas’s lead because it is clearly a winning play for our economy and the environment.

Independent power producers and the PJM Interconnection’s market monitor are urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reject a waiver request from American Electric Power utilities that would allow them to sell up to 750 MW in an upcoming “incremental” capacity auction.

It appears the utilities — Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power and Wheeling Power — want to offload capacity they acquired to serve data centers that didn’t materialize, said Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s market monitor, and the PJM Power Providers Group, a trade organization, in separate filings at FERC.

The utilities are Fixed Resource Requirement entities that supply their own capacity and don’t participate in PJM’s capacity market.

Early last month, the AEP utilities asked FERC for a waiver from FRR rules so they can sell up to 750 MW in an incremental auction set to begin on Feb. 24 for the 2026/2027 delivery year. Typically, PJM holds annual base capacity auctions three years in advance of a delivery year. It then holds incremental auctions for that delivery year to reflect any changes in supply and demand forecasts.

The AEP utilities said PJM needs more capacity and its offer in the incremental auction would help lower capacity prices to the benefit of ratepayers. Also, it is unlikely that offering 750 MW into the auction would hurt third parties because the upcoming capacity year, which begins June 1, is subject to a price cap and floor, the utilities said.

PJM supports the waiver request, saying it will ease resource adequacy concerns for the upcoming capacity year.

FERC in 2015 ruled that rigid enforcement of the FRR sales cap was not “necessary to protect competitive investment,” PJM said in a Nov. 21 filing.

However, Monitoring Analytics and P3 contend the AEP request fails to meet FERC’s standard for issuing waivers to rules it has approved.

“The waiver would allow generators with fully guaranteed cost recovery paid for by their customers to undercut the capacity market in which investors take the risks,” Monitoring Analytics said in a Nov. 26 filing. “The primary result of the proposed waiver would be that the AEP FRR entities would be able to take advantage of the high PJM capacity market prices.”

The AEP request fails to meet FERC’s requirement that a waiver be limited in scope, partly by setting a precedent that would undermine the PJM market design, according to the market monitor.

“If the cap can be waived whenever it proves inconvenient, it ceases to serve its market discipline function, undermines incentives for market based generators, and creates uncertainty for all participants in the PJM capacity market,” Monitoring Analytics said.

Further, the request doesn’t meet FERC’s requirement that a waiver address a concrete problem, saying neither PJM nor AEP has shown the grid operator will be short of supply for the incremental capacity auction, according to P3.

“Given recent downward adjustments for the 2026 load forecast, there is reason to believe that PJM may have over procured capacity for the 2026/2027 delivery year,” P3 said in a Friday filing at FERC.

Also, the waiver would harm market participants, the trade group said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xE5pnWNVVs2WgWR2KCUl4D6MLIwuf2VIvi8X_O2c8hU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Kb2huX0UuX0Ftb3NfUG93ZXJfUGxhbnQuX1VuaXRzXzFfYW5kXzIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-02 13:01:01.323497

So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.
But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.
The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work.
It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.","But before we get to Edison, let’s talk about why the Trump administration just pulled EV tax credits for commercial trucks. It’s not some political statement or shift in environmental priorities, it’s an acknowledgment of reality. America isn’t ready for wholesale adoption of electric trucks because we never did the planning and infrastructure work necessary to make it viable.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

Ford just announced an electric truck for the European market in 2026 with a 186-mile range. For UK operations where you can cover the entire country in a day and the charging infrastructure is relatively dense, that may work. Drop that same truck into American long-haul operations, and it’s useless. The geography doesn’t match, the infrastructure doesn’t exist, and the operational economics don’t work when you’re stopping for multi-hour charging sessions that turn a 10-hour driving day into a 15-hour ordeal with no additional revenue.

Range anxiety isn’t just about miles, it’s about operational flexibility and peace of mind. With diesel, if you need to adjust your route for traffic, weather, or a last-minute load change, you do it. If you’re running low on fuel, you pull into any of the thousands of truck stops and refuel in 15 minutes. That flexibility is what makes trucking work. Battery-electric trucks with fixed range and dependency on sparse charging infrastructure eliminate that flexibility. You’re locked into planned routes with no room for adjustment, and if something goes wrong, you could be stranded waiting for a tow or an hours-long charging session.

For someone whose career has depended on CAT diesels that work in conditions where failure means you’re stuck until a mechanic can reach you, which might be hours or days depending on where you broke down, the idea of voluntarily introducing that kind of vulnerability through technological limitations makes no sense. Diesel works because it’s proven, reliable, and supported by infrastructure that exists everywhere trucks operate.

But Edison Motors changed my thinking on whether EVs can work in trucking, because they approached the problem differently than everyone else.

Edison emerged from logging operations in British Columbia. If you know anything about logging, you know it’s an environment where equipment either works or you’re in serious trouble. You’re operating in remote areas, harsh weather, demanding terrain, and conditions where breakdowns can strand you far from help. Chase Barber and his partners weren’t building trucks to meet regulatory requirements or chase government subsidies, they were solving problems they faced daily running equipment in some of the most unforgiving conditions imaginable.

When they looked at available EV options, they saw the same problems every trucker faces: range limitations, reliance on charging infrastructure, and operational disruptions that make battery-electric trucks impractical for how trucking actually works. So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.

Edison’s trucks feature electric drivetrains with onboard CAT diesel generators that continuously recharge the system. It’s basically a diesel-electric locomotive concept adapted for highway trucking. The electric motors provide instant torque, regenerative braking, and reduced maintenance on brake systems and transmissions. But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.

Here’s what makes this brilliant for someone who trusts diesel: you get the efficiency and performance benefits of electric drive without giving up the reliability and infrastructure compatibility that makes diesel work. You’re not dependent on charging stations that may or may not exist where you need them. You’re not locked into a fixed range with no flexibility. You maintain an unlimited range as long as you can find diesel fuel, which is everywhere. And you’re using proven CAT generator technology rather than betting operations on battery systems that are still evolving.

The peace-of-mind factor is huge. With Edison’s hybrid approach, you can adjust your route or extend your day. If you’re in an area without charging infrastructure, which is most of America, you’re fine. If something goes wrong with the electrical system, you’ve got a diesel generator that can get you to a repair shop rather than being stranded waiting for a specialized EV technician.

Edison just received Canadian regulatory approval to manufacture and sell these hybrid heavy-duty trucks commercially. That’s an actual production vehicle competing in the real market. The approval validates that hybrid approaches can meet safety and emissions standards while addressing operational realities that pure battery-electric solutions ignore.

The fact that this innovation came from a small company emerging from logging operations rather than from major manufacturers or government programs tells you something important about where practical solutions come from. Legacy manufacturers built EVs around battery technology that doesn’t meet operational requirements, then expected infrastructure and regulations to catch up. Government mandates pushed carriers toward technology that doesn’t work for their business models. Meanwhile, Edison listened to what truckers actually need and built solutions that address real-world problems.

This pattern keeps repeating. When FMCSA couldn’t build practical tools to combat chameleon carriers, private companies like Freight Validate and Genlogs stepped in with solutions that work. When legacy systems couldn’t keep pace with technological change, startups built better platforms. When manufacturers focused on removing drivers through automation, Edison focused on giving drivers better tools to be more productive.

The UK’s EV success stems from matching technology to operational environments. Shorter distances, denser infrastructure, coordinated planning, and fleet operations aligned with current EV capabilities created conditions in which the technology could succeed. The US has none of those advantages for long-haul trucking, which moves most freight across the country. We needed better planning, more infrastructure investment, and technology that fits American trucking’s operational realities before pushing aggressive electrification timelines.

The Trump administration’s pulling EV tax credits acknowledges what should have been obvious from the start, we’re not ready. The infrastructure isn’t there. The technology doesn’t match how American trucking operates. And throwing subsidies at the problem without addressing fundamental operational and infrastructure gaps was never going to work.

But that doesn’t mean electric trucks can’t work in trucking. Edison’s success in some of the most demanding conditions imaginable, logging operations in BC’s interior, where equipment failure isn’t an inconvenience, it’s a crisis, proves that EVs can work if you engineer them right. The key is to build around operational realities rather than forcing operations to adapt to technological limitations.

For me, diesel will always be what I know and trust. CAT 3406s have kept me moving and freight delivered through conditions that would have killed lesser equipment. That reliability and peace of mind aren’t something you give up lightly. If Edison Motors has taught me anything, it’s that EV technology can work even in the woods of British Columbia if you approach it with practical engineering rather than regulatory fantasy.

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work. You keep the infrastructure compatibility, operational flexibility, and the peace of mind that come with proven technology. But you add efficiency benefits, reduced maintenance, and emissions improvements that address legitimate environmental concerns without sacrificing operational viability.

That’s the kind of innovation that deserves attention, not because it’s revolutionary or disruptive or any other marketing buzzword, but because it actually solves problems that matter to people running trucks. It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.

Ford’s 186-mile-range European EV might work fine in the UK, where geography, infrastructure, and operational profiles align with its technology capabilities. It won’t work in American long-haul operations, and removing tax credits that were propping up technology adoption before infrastructure and operations were ready is an acknowledgment of that reality.

What we need isn’t more aggressive mandates or bigger subsidies, it’s better planning, infrastructure investment that matches operational needs, and technology designed around how trucking actually works rather than how regulators wish it worked. The UK did that planning. The US didn’t. Edison Motors did that engineering. Most manufacturers didn’t.

I’m still a diesel guy. I trust what I know works. But I’m also paying attention to what Edison is building because they’re approaching the problem the right way, starting with operational needs and working backward to the technology that addresses them. That’s how practical innovation happens, and it’s proof that EVs can work in trucking if you’re willing to engineer solutions grounded in reality rather than regulatory timelines.

If Edison can make electric hybrids work in logging operations in BC, there’s hope that thoughtful engineering can bridge the gap between diesel reliability and electric efficiency. But it requires listening to what truckers actually need rather than telling them what they should want. The removal of EV tax credits might slow down the rush to electrification. Still, if it creates space for practical solutions like Edison’s hybrid approach to develop and prove themselves, that’s probably a better path forward than subsidizing technology that doesn’t work for how American trucking operates.

Sometimes the best innovations come from the people closest to the problems. Edison Motors getting approval to build electric hybrid heavy-duty trucks in Canada might matter more for trucking’s future than anything Ford or Tesla or any other major manufacturer announces, precisely because Edison was built by truckers who understand what actually works when you’re 100 miles from anywhere and your equipment has to perform or you’re in trouble.

That’s the kind of peace of mind I can respect, even from a diesel guy like me.",https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02/Rob-C-12-1-C.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:26.709323

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25.
Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas.
But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers.","The Southwestern Public Service Company has asked the state of New Mexico to grant exceptions to the state’s Energy Transition Act for two proposed gas-fired power plants, including one exception that would see approximately one-third of the energy produced at one plant qualify as a “zero-carbon resource” like solar panels or wind turbines.

A second exception would exempt both plants from the act’s zero-carbon requirement, “to preserve system reliability and protect customers from unreasonable bill impacts.”

The two proposed plants would be in Texas, with the larger of the two — called Gaines County Power Plant — to be built just across the border from Hobbs, New Mexico. Even though the two wouldn’t be in the state, New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires that all energy sold in the state by investor-owned utilities be from zero-carbon-emission sources by 2045, no matter where it is generated. The act was an early environmental win for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The request is part of a wide-ranging application the Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, has before the Public Regulation Commission of New Mexico for new transmission lines, extended closure dates for existing coal-fired power plants and eight new power facilities — two each of natural gas, solar, wind and battery systems. The $10 billion plan covers the company’s service area in the southeast corner of the state and parts of West Texas.

While most of the proposed plants would generate renewable energy, the two gas plants would generate 51% of the total energy in the application.

“To pretend that natural gas in some way or another is a zero carbon resource is just a bald-faced lie,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, and an energy watchdog. “It’s profound greenwashing.”

Southwestern Public Service Company has requested that all costs associated with two new solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers.

The majority of Southwestern Public Service Company’s coverage area and energy sales are in Texas, but, according to Xcel, much of the projected increase in energy would be used in New Mexico, particularly in the state’s portion of the Permian Basin, the nation’s largest oil field. More than 50% of the company’s energy sales in New Mexico already go to oil and gas companies to power their wells and other infrastructure with grid-based electricity. Oil and gas revenues are also the state’s biggest single source of income.

According to the application, replacing the two proposed gas plants with renewable energy sources would cost New Mexico customers an additional $5.5 billion and raise residential electricity rates by more than 40%.

And the gas plants may be on the way. “We have already signed and executed contracts for the turbines,” Kaley Green, a senior media relations representative for Xcel Energy, said. “We anticipate a 40-year service life for each of the plants.”

In the application the company requests that all costs associated with the two solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers because they will be built to meet New Mexico Energy Transition Act requirements, “not because they were needed for the overall system.” In addition, it asks for a speedy approval of the solar plants to secure renewable energy tax credits that were enhanced under President Joe Biden but had their timeframes dramatically curtailed under President Donald Trump.

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25. The commission plans to reach a decision on the Gaines Plant zero-carbon request by Dec. 10 and a decision on the full application by May 7. Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.

“It is a lot for one filing, but it’s not absurd,” said AnnaLinden Weller, senior policy adviser with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit that fights climate change and its impacts across the western U.S. Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “It’s certainly the biggest one that I’ve seen, but not by a huge amount.”

Southwestern Public Service Company cites several factors for the size and complexity of the application: It wants to close two aging coal-fired plants in Texas; it sees increased demand from oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin, data centers and other industries; and there are new requirements from the power-sharing system in which the new plants would operate, the Southwest Power Pool. Despite its name, the pool runs from southeast New Mexico north to the Canadian border, balancing production loads from utility companies in 14 states along the way.

In August 2024, the pool raised the production reserve requirements of member utilities like Xcel from an annual 15% to 16% in summer and 36% in winter. (A production reserve requirement is extra power production capacity available for unexpected peak loads.) The new winter load requirement was in part a response to the winter storms of 2021 and 2022 that created sudden, massive electrical demands from damaged energy systems across the Southwest Power Pool.

The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

The request to keep the new gas-fired plants beyond 2045, when New Mexico pledged to reach zero carbon emissions, aims for a possible loophole in the law.

“So there’s a weird thing about the Renewable Energy Act. It doesn’t prohibit fossil fuels per se,” Weller said, so long as the utility can convince the Public Regulation Commission that it will be producing zero carbon electricity for New Mexico customers by 2045 while hitting ever smaller targets along the way.

Xcel’s Green said, “We will continue to work towards compliance with the 2045 goals and adjust our grid planning as we proceed, based on technology and other factors.”

If that’s not possible, Weller said the commission has the discretion to give utilities “wiggle room” for the 2045 zero carbon requirement if the utility faces reliability or affordability issues — both of which Southwestern Public Service Company explicitly claimed in its application. No utility has tried for such an exemption before, Weller said.

In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas. That plant would have produced about 11% of the electricity that the proposed Gaines County and Tolk plants would generate together. But, “They didn’t have a plan for how it would be possible for them to comply with the Renewable Energy Act,” Weller said — such as asking for exemptions from the act.

Another loophole in the act allows a utility to claim a fossil fuel plant is a “zero carbon resource” if that plant’s use reduces methane emissions “as a result of electricity production” by a 10-to-1 ratio or better of carbon dioxide to methane emissions. Southwestern Public Service Company hired an outside economist to show how electrifying oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin could offset enough methane emitted by wells and associated facilities to qualify roughly one-third of the electricity from the Gaines County plant as “zero carbon.”

“We’re still thinking about that as a legal question,” Weller said. “A plain reading of the Renewable Energy Act [the underlying law for the Energy Transition Act] says that the generation resource has to be zero carbon, not the effects of the generation resource.”

She added, “Are there climate impacts? Yeah. The question is are they big enough or worthwhile enough given what you’re building.”

Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate warming, but methane is far more potent, producing more than 80 times the warming potential as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

“There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

~ Camilla Feibelman, director, Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter

On Nov. 12, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 World Energy Outlook, which concluded that oil and gas demand will not peak before 2050, as previously hoped for — and needed — if the planet is to avoid increasingly frequent climate change catastrophes. The report goes on to say that with the increase in fossil fuel use, “exceeding 1.5°C is now inevitable.” Holding global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels was the stated goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.

“There is some low-hanging fruit that we can get from electrifying the oil field, and ideally the infrastructure would be communicable to some future replacement industries that might help the state head in some different direction,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director.

“But you can’t deny the fact that it basically builds a more permanent infrastructure around oil and gas extraction,” she continued. “There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

In 2023, Chevron touted a 20-megawatt solar field it built in southern New Mexico to power a nearby gas facility and reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. For a while, the facility was a prominent focus of the company’s social media advertising in New Mexico.

But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers. The plant is expected to produce 2.5 gigawatts of electricity, 125 times the amount of the solar field.

When asked about the fossil fuel power plants in the Southwestern Public Service Company application and how they mesh with the Energy Transition Act her administration championed, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s office punted.

Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, wrote, “Nearly half of this proposal is renewable energy. The same law that sets those aggressive renewables targets provides an exception process for utilities to protect system reliability. We’re confident the [Public Regulation Commission] can make the technical determination about whether it’s truly necessary. We’ll let that process move forward.”

If approved, Southwestern Public Service Company will build the Gaines County plant about five miles south-southeast of Hobbs, a town of about 40,000. The prevailing wind patterns would carry much of the exhaust from the new plant right over town.

“It’s not like there’s some bright-line border separating New Mexico and Texas’ pollution,” Feibelman said, and the region already suffers from bad air pollution. The American Lung Association has given both Lea and Eddy counties — the center of New Mexico’s portion of the Permian — failing grades for their ozone levels. The American Lung Association does not have ozone figures for the Texas side of the basin.

“The Permian Basin is basically out of compliance with federal ozone standards,” Feibelman said. “It’s kids, it’s communities, it’s elderly people that are going to pay the price of this poor air quality no matter where they live.”

This research paves the way for more robust, uncertainty-aware energy transition planning, especially for regions facing extreme weather and institutional constraints.","A new article published in Nature Communications offers insight into how government planners can better account for the many uncertainties that accompany the transition from fossil-fuel power systems to renewable or decarbonized systems. The paper, titled “Identifying key uncertainties in energy transitions with a Puerto Rico case study,” is the work of a team from the University of Virginia including first author Kamiar Khayambashi, a Ph.D. student in the Engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science.

Khayambashi and his advisor, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering Negin Alemazkoor, worked with co-authors Andres Clarens, a CEE professor and associate director of the UVA Environmental Institute, and UVA emeritus professor of public policy William Shobe. In the paper, they make a compelling case that planners need to do better at taking the right uncertainties into account when readying for an energy transition.

The team developed a three-stage analytical framework and applied it to the electricity system of Puerto Rico, a hurricane-prone island heavily dependent on fossil fuels. The study analyzed three transition pathways: Business as Usual (BAU), Fully Renewable (FR) by 2050 and Fully Decarbonized (FD) by 2050.

Key results show that changes in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes due to climate change emerged as the single largest source of uncertainty in the expected total system cost. Organizational inefficiency (e.g., delays, miscoordination in restoration of infrastructure services) was the second most important uncertainty but is rarely included in energy-system modeling.

Demonstrating that uncertainty can be reduced to a few key factors may encourage planners to account for those critical uncertainties, rather than ignoring them because they seem overwhelmingly complex.

“In a high-hurricane-risk region with a history of institutional inefficiencies such as Puerto Rico — and the case of grid restoration after Hurricane Maria — the yearly cost of the power grid cannot be accurately judged without explicitly modeling the uncertainties in climate, technology, fuel and institutional performance,” Khayambashi said.

Unfortunately, when it comes to planning and investments, the appropriate uncertainties are not considered, which leads to inaccuracies. As utilities and regulators plan long-term investments in clean energy transitions, many models assume a fixed “best-guess” value for fuel prices, technology cost declines, and weather or climate trends. This new research shows that such deterministic planning may miss critical cost-risks from multiple interacting uncertainties, especially in regions vulnerable to extreme weather and with consistent institutional efficiency challenges.

This study offers a strategic way to focus on data collection, modeling refinement and risk-mitigation efforts: identify which uncertainties matter most.

“Demonstrating that the high-dimensional uncertainty in long-term planning can be reduced to a few key factors may encourage planners to explicitly account for those critical uncertainties, rather than ignoring them because the problem seems overwhelmingly complex,” Alemazkoor said.

For example, in Puerto Rico, energy planners should integrate climate extreme risk models — here, that would be hurricane frequency and intensity — into infrastructure cost and resilience assessments. And organizational risk, such as restoration delays after storms, should be treated as a quantifiable input cost, not just a sidenote.

While the case study is specific to Puerto Rico, the authors emphasize that the framework can be applied in other geographies and under differing policy horizons.

“Our results show that resilience and organizational performance can matter as much as fuel price volatility when designing energy systems for the long term,” Clarens said.

Should the handy credits expire on December 31, a so-called “subsidy cliff” will be reinstated, putting Americans at risk of soaring health insurance costs.

Should the enhanced ACA premium tax credits expire on December 31, the roughly 22.4 million people relying on these subsidies would be hit with steep increases in their health insurance premiums starting in 2026.

Their premiums could more than double next year, per a preview of the available plans released by the Trump administration.

Millions more would lose subsidized ACA marketplace coverage, and roughly 3.8 million people are projected to lose health insurance coverage entirely and become uninsured each year from 2026 to 2034 due to high costs, per the Congressional Budget Office.

Around 47% of American adults reported fears that they would not be able to cover the cost of necessary health care should the tax credits expire, per a West Health-Gallup poll from last month.

The poll saw the highest level of concern surrounding health care in the past four years and also found that roughly 20% were unable to afford their prescriptions in recent months.

Rising medical costs are not sustainable in the long run, Joel White, president of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, told NewsNation.

“If current trends persist, by 2032 the typical American family will pay 40% … of their income just on health care premiums,” said White.

“The subsidies are a temporary fix. We’ve got a very expensive system. Subsidizing an expensive system will get you a more expensive system,” he added.

As Americans currently enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans are already seeing the higher premium costs reflected in plan previews during the ongoing Open Enrollment Period, Congress is planning to vote on the subsidies before the end of the month.

‘SUBSIDY CLIFF’

A major point of contention during the lengthy government shutdown earlier this year, the enhanced premium tax credits were originally established by the American Rescue Plan Act and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act.

These refundable tax credits were intended to help Americans afford health insurance bought via the ACA marketplace.

They work by capping the amount that individuals and families must spend on their health plans, with the government subsidy covering the remaining portion.

Before 2021, only households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level were eligible for the tax credits, ultimately creating a “subsidy cliff” in which a small jump in income could completely disqualify a family for assistance.

The American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act enhancements temporarily removed this subsidy cliff by allowing access to the tax credits for households with incomes greater than 400% of the federal poverty level.

The changes also made the subsidies more generous overall, spiking marketplace enrollment significantly from roughly 12 million Americans in 2021 to a record 24.2 million in 2025, according to an explainer from the Commonwealth Fund.

“Green tech manufacturing is being built in an era when advanced digital technologies are mature and widely accessible.

Today, the industry is evolving into something far more dynamic: a hub for innovation, sustainability, and purpose-driven careers. Experts say this transformation is reshaping not only what manufacturing looks like but why it matters.

Beyond the Assembly Line: A High-Tech Reality

“People still picture manufacturing as the assembly lines of the early 20th century,” says Thomas Kurfess, executive director of the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute. “The reality is very different. Modern plants are among the most advanced environments you’ll find, packed with robotics, automation, and data-driven systems. In fact, if you want to see the largest number of robots in one location, it will be at an automotive assembly plant.”

That disconnect between perception and reality is one reason manufacturers struggle to fill roles despite record demand. Kurfess notes that students often overlook manufacturing careers because they assume the work is low tech. “We need to expose educators, parents, and students to what manufacturing truly looks like,” he says. Facility tours and partnerships with technical colleges can help shift the narrative.

Pinar Keskinocak, H. Milton and Carolyn J. Stewart School Chair in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, agrees: “Showcasing innovations like AI-driven automation, 3D printing, and smart factories is key to changing perceptions.”

Green Tech and Digital Transformation

The rise of electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy is accelerating this shift. “Green technology presents a transformative opportunity for U.S. manufacturing,” Kurfess explains. “It is not just about sustainability; it is about national security and global competitiveness.”

These sectors are inherently digital, says Nagi Gebraeel, Georgia Power Term Professor in the College of Engineering. “Green tech manufacturing is being built in an era when advanced digital technologies are mature and widely accessible. Factories are designed from the ground up with automation and sensing embedded, creating highly interconnected systems.”

This evolution demands new skills. The labor force must navigate environments where operational technology and information technology converge. Gebraeel predicts that by 2035, manufacturing leaders will increasingly come from operations and data-driven backgrounds rather than traditional IT.

The Workforce Challenge

Despite the promise of high-tech careers, talent pipelines remain thin. Manpreet Hora, senior associate dean in the Scheller College of Business, points to a “demand-supply mismatch” driven by rapidly changing skill requirements. “Manufacturing now needs workers who combine technical, digital, and soft skills,” he says. “Meanwhile, younger workers often gravitate toward service industries for perceived growth and tech exposure. The manufacturing sector will collectively need to reposition themselves as employers of choice by making their digital tools visible, highlighting career progression, and offering flexible learning pathways.”

Experts agree that education must adapt. Kurfess advocates for a systemwide approach starting in elementary school, while Gebraeel emphasizes integrating AI into curricula and offering modular micro-credentials for upskilling. Hora adds that hands-on training should reflect realities like AI-enabled operations and sustainability-focused processes.

Purpose and Innovation

For younger professionals seeking meaningful work, manufacturing offers more than a paycheck. “These are high-tech, high-impact roles where workers build products that move the world, from aircraft and medical devices to renewable energy systems,” Kurfess says.

To position the industry as an innovation hub, leaders must embrace technologies that enhance efficiency and quality while fostering collaboration across schools, businesses, and government. “Modernizing the image of manufacturing demands aligned messaging and shared investment,” he adds.

Looking Ahead

By 2035, experts envision a workforce fluent in AI, committed to lifelong learning, and working in environments where cyber and physical systems are seamlessly integrated. Manufacturing will remain a cornerstone of economic strength, but its true value will lie in its ability to innovate, adapt, and deliver purpose-driven careers.",https://news.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/hg_media/2025-02/fileKdkuny,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:41.885574

So, what are the consequences for real-time dynamics of adding these huge sources of demand to existing networks? And can domestic production meet significant demand growth from both LNG production and power generation?

Gas production and pricing and the impact of large-load real-time behaviour on power markets were key themes at our recent Power and Gas Trading Conference in Houston. Fill out the form at the top of the page to download slide decks from the event covering these and other topics, or read on for a brief overview.

Theme 1: The impact of large loads on power markets

Large loads are the new volatility source for power trading

Power market traders are used to tracking a range of issues that can impact real-time pricing in energy markets, from generating facility downtime, network outages and renewables intermittency to more serious weather-related disruption. However, our real-time analysis of US power markets shows that large-load behaviour is driving a critical shift, with large loads increasingly a major source of volatility.

Our case studies of the Lake Mariner Data Center in upstate New York and Meta’s 2.5 million square feet Henrico Data Center campus in Virginia show these single facilities are the source of massive, un-forecasted load swings. Lake Mariner executed 13 demand response events in July 2025 alone, more than twice the number of Emergency Actions taken by NYISO, the regional independent system operator. With the Lake Mariner campus representing around 9% of Zone A demand in NYISO, demand fluctuations at the facility are having clear price impacts.

Concentrated demand amplifies congestion risk

Real-time power market dynamics driven by Tesla’s Gigafactory in Austin Texas highlight a further issue caused by concentrated demand from large loads: the amplification of congestion risk. This huge manufacturing facility employs around 20,000 people and is the world’s second largest building by volume. The site has an assumed consumption capacity of around 250 MW, with onsite solar generation and battery storage helping to reduce the amount of power drawn from the grid during peak summer pricing.

Fluctuating demand and generation at the facility bring congestion risk. For example, during the first week of September 2025, a constraint in Bell County coupled with a long-standing line outage in the area resulted in elevated real-time prices for the plant throughout peak consumption hours (see dotted lines on the chart below). This demonstrates how concentrated demand coupled with onsite generation can be susceptible to basis risk, that must then be managed around.

Real-time visibility into un-forecasted load ramps gives traders the edge

The ability to monitor and detect un-forecasted load ramp-ups and ramp-downs caused by large-load facilities like Lake Mariner and Gigafactory Texas is a vital advantage in fast-moving power markets. Wood Mackenzie’s PowerRT solution provides the real-time visibility traders need to act quickly and exploit trading opportunities as these events unfold. At the same time, our new Nodal Price Forecast for ERCOT leverages our congestion expertise, allowing large load facilities to manage basis risk while enabling traders to capture spreads ahead of the market.

Theme 2: Meeting growing gas demand from LNG and data centres

US LNG production continues to grow

Several major projects have contributed to US LNG export capacity growing by over 30% year on year. Work has progressed ahead of schedule on the third phase of Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility in Texas, with four of seven trains already online. At Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG plant, all trains are online, with power island commissioning ongoing. And at ExxonMobil and QatarEnergy’s Golden Pass joint venture in Texas, Train 1 (of three) is expected to begin liquefaction around the end of the year.

Can gas prices incentivise enough production to meet LNG growth?

Based on projects under construction or nearing a final investment decision, we forecast durable growth in US LNG production, with an additional 18 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of capacity becoming operational over the next ten years.

Gas production and LNG exports have become increasingly interconnected over the past few years, with the US Lower 48 and Western Canada effectively turned into synthetic storage, adapting daily production to ongoing demand. At the moment, gas prices are incentivising enough production to meet current growth expectations for increased LNG production, with supply from Haynesville, Marcellus/Utica and Permian plays expected to increase steadily. However, if incremental gas supply is needed to meet additional demand growth from large loads, higher prices will be required.

Can gas production grow as needed to meet large-load demand growth?

In theory, domestic gas production should be able to grow to meet the significant added power demand from the growth in data centres and other large industrial loads. Pipeline capacity could present an obstacle to supply growth; for example, there are limits on export capacity in the Marcellus/Utica. However, local demand growth should debottleneck the region and allow for more production growth. Increasingly, the availability of gas as an electricity generating resource will be a key factor in the siting of data centres and other large-load facilities.

H2 201 Explained

As hydrogen adoption continues to grow across the U.S., particularly in transit and municipal fleets, so does the need for thorough safety training. Hydrogen's unique properties - including its dispersion behavior, pressure requirements, and wide flammability range - make fuel systems that use it fundamentally different from those in natural gas vehicles (NGVs). This course bridges the knowledge gap for technicians who may already be familiar with CNG but need specialized training for hydrogen.

H2 201 covers critical topics like:

Hydrogen fuel system component function and identification.

Required inspection tools and methods.

Depressurizing, defueling, and leak detection.

Hydrogen cylinder damage assessments and classifications.

Requirements under SAE2579, CGA C-6.4, and FMVSS 307 and 308.

Along with its prerequisite course, H2 101: Hydrogen Vehicle Essentials and Safety Practices, AFVi's hydrogen fuel system inspector certification program is designed so that technicians who complete the training and pass the certification exam are fully qualified to conduct inspections that meet all current safety codes and standards.

Coursework was developed with cooperation from The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC), which allowed AFVi visual access to its hydrogen fueling station and vehicles, as well as contributed photos and videos.

As much as various high ranking officials in the Trump administration would like to pretend that energy storage is not a thing existing in time and space, it does. Batteries are already replacing fossil fuels in vehicles and power stations. Now they are beginning to pull duty in the sticky world of hard-to-decarbonize commercial and industrial applications. In an interesting twist, the latest development in the C&I space involves a concentrating solar power system capable of delivering the clean kilowatts on a ’round-the-clock basis, with the help of thermal energy storage.

Energy Storage & Concentrating Solar Power

The concentrating solar power angle may come as a surprise, considering that the technology got a bad rap here in the US after a series of high profile flops in the early 2000s. However, CSP has caught on elsewhere around the world.

For those of you new to the topic, CSP systems are just what the name says. Instead of converting sunlight directly to electricity in a photovoltaic cell, CSP systems typically deploy large fields of specialized mirrors called heliostats. They collectively bounce sunlight onto a central point, where a reciever heats a liquid transfer medium typically composed of molten salt. CSP systems can also come in the form of long, parabolic troughs, and they can heat particles of sand or other matter instead of heating a liquid.

Either way, the transfer medium acts as a sort of two-way energy storage system. It can be called up when needed for commercial and industrial processes that require heat, even after the sun goes down. Or, the transfer medium can be shunted to a generating station, where it produces steam to run a turbine that spits out electricity (see lots more CSP background here).

If that sounds complicated and expensive compared to simply parking a solar panel out in the sun, it is. During the Obama administration, the US Department of Energy tried to help the domestic CSP industry launch itself into being, but nothing of consequence stuck. Still, the Energy Department continued to fund innovation in the CSP field all during the first Trump administration from 2017 to 2021. The Biden administration also picked up the CSP R&D torch and ran with it, all the way until January 20 of this year, when the task fell to Trump again.

As of March, the Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicated that third-generation CSP research programs were continuing during Trump’s second time in the Oval Office. However, last week Energy Secretary Chris Wright changed NREL’s name to “National Laboratory of the Rockies,” so who knows what goes on there.

247Solar Has Fossil Fuel’s Number

The US startup 247Solar is among the CSP innovators not waiting around for further support from the Energy Department. The company’s flagship “247Solar Plant” heat-plus-power system combines CSP with a heat-storing battery, enabling it to last longer than earlier CSP-based energy storage systems. As a backup, the battery is also designed to be source-agnostic, running on alternate fuels in case of a shortfall in solar availability. The battery is also compatible with wind power and grid-sourced electricity, too.

The company is new to the CleanTechnica radar, so now is a good time for catch-up. It launched in 2015, co-founded by the late MIT Professor Emeritus David Gordon Wilson and longtime solar engineering and architecture professional David Anderson, who serves as CEO.

MIT News profiled the company last year, noting that Professor Wilson’s high-temperature heat exchanger provides the technology platform for the system. As described by Anderson, the heat exchanger is integrated with a conventional turbine. Similar to those used in jet engines, the turbine circulates hot air without requiring combustion or producing emissions.

MIT News reporter Zach Winn provides some further details about the system. The central tower in the CSP part of the operation supports a proprietary solar receiver capable of reaching 1,000 degrees Celsius. Some of the hot air can go directly to drive the turbines to produce electricity while the sun is shining. The rest is routed to a long duration solid-state thermal energy storage system, which takes over when the sun goes down.

“We offer round-the-clock electricity, but we also offer a combined heat and power option, with the ability to take heat up to 970 Celsius for use in industrial processes,” Anderson told MIT News. “It’s a very flexible system.”

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

247Solar has already cultivated a $250 million pipeline of projects around the world for its heat-plus-power CSP system, reportedly including a major utility in India. Accordingly, earlier this week 247Solar announced the launch of a new Series B capital raise aimed at hitting the $25 million mark, enabling it to scale up operations.

In a press statement, 247Solar indicated that its that its existing investors have already put up $3.5 million towards a successful raise, and that forthcoming commitments are in the pipeline pending due diligence.

The demand is certainly there. Although US President Donald Trump has done his best to throttle down the domestic wind and solar industries, the global race for reliable, economical clean power is continuing apace. 247Solar notes that its project pipeline includes Africa, Europe, Australia, and South America, as well as India, with a focus on mining and desalination operations, among other industrial applications.

“Industrial companies worldwide face the urgent need to decarbonize their energy use — without sacrificing reliability, cost, or performance,” 247Solar emphasized in a press statement dated December 1. “And 60% of industrial energy use across sectors is to produce heat, not power, typically by burning fossil fuels.”

Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Typical CSP systems are sprawling, one-of-a-kind facilities tailored to their location, adding risk as well as expense. In contrast, 247Solar has developed a cost-cutting, modular system that can be fabricated in a factory setting and hauled out to the site.

With the combination of heat and power in hand, 247Solar notes that cutting carbon emissions down to the bone is just part of the picture. In addition to reducing the carbon footprint of an operation’s energy systems by up to 95%, 247Solar estimates that energy costs can be cut by 25% or more.

Adding to the attraction is 247Solar’s EaaS (Energy-as-a-Service) business model. EaaS contracts typically provide business with the ability to upgrade their energy systems without paying up front for new equipment. “In addition, 247Solar solutions typically increase reliability and improve performance,” 247Solar also says of itself.

That remains to be seen. However, considering the extent of 247Solar’s global project pipeline, apparently some leading energy consumers have seen enough. If all goes according to plan, 247Solar will deploy the Series B funding to establish a cost-cutting, mass production system for a new 3.5-megawatt module. That’s a big leap up from the company’s current size of 400 kilowatts, but the timeline calls for full development to be completed within the next six months or so, leading to deployment in 2027.

Don’t be surprised to see 247Solar cropping up here in the US, too. 247Solar includes North American on its to-do list, along with its overseas pipeline. For all the hot air about “American Energy Dominance” blowing out of the White House, solar power is the fastest, most abundant, and most economical way to add more kilowatts to the nation’s power profile.

Clean Energy has completed its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility at South Fork Dairy in Dimmitt, Texas.

The site, now one of the largest RNG plants in the U.S., can produce ~2.6 million gallons of RNG per year.

The project processes 300,000 gallons of manure daily using four anaerobic digesters.

EPA has approved the facility to generate RINs under the Renewable Fuel Standard, with LCFS credits expected in 2026.

The company's leaders and the dairy owner highlighted circular-economy and emissions-reduction benefits.

Clean Energy Brings New RNG Production Facility Online

Clean Energy has announced the successful completion of its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility at South Fork Dairy in Dimmitt, Texas. The plant, now producing pipeline-quality RNG, has begun injection into the interstate natural gas pipeline.

The facility, financed entirely by Clean Energy, represents an $85 million investment and is among the nation’s largest RNG production sites. South Fork Dairy houses approximately 17,500 cows and is capable of producing around 2.6 million gallons of low-carbon RNG per year.

Clay Corbus, Senior Vice President at Clean Energy, said, “The completion of the project at South Fork is particularly special because not only is it a major step forward in building our low-carbon RNG supply… but we were able to work side-by-side with such a remarkable dairyman in Frank Brand.”

Clean Energy Highlights Circular Benefits for Agriculture

Designed to process up to 300,000 gallons of dairy manure per day, the facility uses four anaerobic digesters along with advanced gas-conversion equipment. The RNG produced is injected directly into an on-site gas line, and Clean Energy will receive 100 percent of the output.

Frank Brand, owner of South Fork Dairy, commented: “Partnering with Clean Energy to build an RNG facility on the dairy has been a success for us… Being a part of something so circular that allows the dairy to reduce its emissions while providing an additional income stream is an added bonus.”

Construction temporarily paused due to a fire impacting the dairy, but operations at both the dairy and the RNG facility have since been fully restored.

Regulatory Approvals Advance Clean Energy’s RNG Expansion

The RNG produced at South Fork Dairy has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for generating Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The suit claims that Duke attempted to block Florida-based NTE from competing to provide electricity for the city of Fayetteville.
Duke filed a petition in February asking the US Supreme Court to take the case.
The full 4th Circuit voted, 11-2, in November 2024 against hearing the case en banc.
Appeals Court Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote for the unanimous 4th Circuit panel that ruled against Duke.","The US solicitor general opposes Duke Energy’s request to have the nation’s highest court review an anti-monopoly lawsuit against the utility company. A federal Appeals court ruled in 2024 that competitor NTE Carolinas could move forward with its suit against Duke.

The suit claims that Duke attempted to block Florida-based NTE from competing to provide electricity for the city of Fayetteville.

Duke filed a petition in February asking the US Supreme Court to take the case. The high court issued a June order inviting Solicitor General John Sauer to submit a brief expressing the federal government’s view of the case.

“This appeal arises out of a campaign by an established monopolist to stop a more efficient rival from disturbing its long-dominant hold over a regional energy market,” according to the brief Sauer’s office filed Monday. “Applying the established summary-judgment standard, the court of appeals concluded that this exclusionary campaign did not involve competition ‘on the merits,’ because petitioner could not compete with respondent on the basis of efficiency. And the court found that this campaign produced the very harms the federal antitrust laws are designed to prevent — ‘reduced consumer choice, higher prices in the long term, and market foreclosure.’”

The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals “properly held” that Duke was not entitled to summary judgment in the case. “That fact-bound decision does not warrant further review,” Sauer’s brief argued. “Nor is this case a suitable vehicle to announce any broader rule of antitrust law.”

The solicitor general labeled Duke Energy the “beneficiary of a government grant more than a century ago.” Duke “has controlled the wholesale-power market in the Carolinas for generations. It has maintained that position in part because many barriers to entry exist in this industry.”

“Power plants have high startup costs, and ‘anchor’ clients sizable enough to cover those costs are rare,” the solicitor general argued. “By dissuading such customers from switching to a potential competitor, an entrenched monopolist can prevent new entrants from gaining a foothold in the region — without creating a better product, producing a better service, or implementing a general price cut.”

The record in the case “would support a finding that that is exactly what happened here,” according to the brief.

“Petitioner’s older plants were ‘not competitive’ with respondent’s plants, which used superior technology to produce cleaner power at a far cheaper rate,” Sauer’s brief argued. “So when respondent sought to build a new facility in the Carolinas, petitioner sought to target the competition itself. Petitioner recognized that this new plant would be viable only if respondent could sell power to the City of Fayetteville, the one sizable customer in the area whose contract was coming due. Petitioner therefore took a variety of steps intended to deter Fayetteville from switching to a new supplier.”

“Petitioner succeeded — and respondent presented sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that petitioner did so through means ‘other than efficiency,’” the brief continued. “For instance, petitioner ‘manufactured’ a ‘sham breach’ of an interconnection agreement to make it appear that respondent’s plant would be ‘unable to transmit its power.’”

“Likewise, petitioner restructured Fayetteville’s contract to give the City a short-term discount and lump-sum payment, which petitioner would recoup through a long-term price hike on other customers,” Sauer’s brief added. “All told, without ever competing with respondent on the merits (i.e., offering a better service), petitioner was able to prevent respondent from operating its superior facility.”

“When a monopolist engages in a coordinated campaign to squelch competition, no circuit holds that each discrete aspect of the defendant’s conduct must be analyzed in isolation,” the solicitor general argued. “Instead, courts uniformly agree, consistent with this [Supreme] Court’s precedent, that a holistic analysis is appropriate in circumstances like these.”

A unanimous three-judge 4th Circuit panel ruled against Duke Energy in August 2024. The panel threw out a trial judge’s ruling in the dispute. The full 4th Circuit voted, 11-2, in November 2024 against hearing the case en banc.

Duke’s Supreme Court petition criticized the 4th Circuit panel’s decision.

“This petition presents an important and recurring question of antitrust law: when can 0 + 0 = 1? The district court found that antitrust math is no different from ordinary arithmetic. If an antitrust plaintiff pleads a series of independently lawful acts, each of which does not violate this Court’s precedents, those acts cannot together add up to some nebulous antitrust violation,” Duke’s lawyers wrote. “The court of appeals concluded otherwise, embracing a ‘monopoly broth’ theory prominent in the 1960s to 1980s but long since discarded.”

“This Court’s intervention is needed to restore antitrust law to the principles that have governed for the last three decades,” the petition continued.

The 4th Circuit “bucked” the consensus of “[f]ive courts of appeals, numerous district courts, and the leading antitrust treatise” about the proper approach to the case, Duke’s lawyers argued.

“[T]o get around this Court’s well-established tests for predatory pricing, refusals to deal, and sham litigation, NTE dusted off the old monopoly-broth playbook, arguing that Duke was liable because of its overall ‘anticompetitive scheme,’” the petition argued. “This time, the move worked. Breaking from decades of case law, the Fourth Circuit held that antitrust plaintiffs can add up distinct, independently lawful actions and put their ‘combined effect’ before a jury.”

NTE Carolinas responded to Duke’s arguments in its Supreme Court brief.

“The Fourth Circuit held that respondents have a triable monopolization case for two independent reasons,” the brief explained. “First, a reasonable jury could find multiple acts by Duke unlawful under this Court’s canonical tests for predatory pricing and refusal to deal. Second, petitioners’ conduct involved ‘a complex or atypical exclusionary campaign, the individual components of which do not fit neatly within pre-established categories.’”

“Because this Court’s specific tests for common types of monopolistic conduct do not cover all the ‘many different forms’ of anticompetitive conduct, which ‘cannot always be categorized,’ the court below also considered Duke’s course of conduct ‘as a whole’ and found that a reasonable jury could find it anti-competitive,” NTE Carolinas’ lawyers wrote.

Appeals Court Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote for the unanimous 4th Circuit panel that ruled against Duke.

“In particular, NTE presented evidence in the district court that Duke devised a plan to ensure that NTE, its only serious competitor, would not have the opportunity to compete for the business of Fayetteville, North Carolina, the only major wholesale customer whose long-term contract with Duke was expiring soon enough to allow NTE to compete for its business,” Niemeyer wrote.

“The district court granted Duke’s motion for summary judgment, in which Duke argued that the conduct that NTE imputed to Duke constituted legitimate competition in seeking to retain Fayetteville’s business and that none of the actions on which NTE relied was unlawful,” Niemeyer added. “While the court concluded that there was a question of fact on whether Duke had monopoly power, it also concluded as a matter of law that Duke did not engage in anticompetitive conduct but rather legitimate competition to retain Fayetteville’s business.”

“While we recognize that much of Duke’s conduct can be understood to be legitimate competitive conduct, … we also have found much from which a jury could conclude that Duke’s actions were illegitimate anticompetitive conduct that violated § 2 of the Sherman Act,” the 4th Circuit opinion continued. “Because genuine disputes of material fact exist, we vacate the district court’s summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/john-sauer.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:04:41.313754

(PGY), a joint venture between Plankton Energy and Gratitude Railroad, announced the final close of its inaugural fund, surpassing its $10 million equity target to support a portfolio of 35 – 40 solar projects worth an estimated $40 million. The launch comes amid a surge in U.S. electricity demand — driven by electric vehicle adoption, AI data centers, and the broader electrification of industry — and demonstrates that distributed clean energy can continue to get financed and developed amid policy changes.

PGY’s development and operational strength is powered by Plankton Energy, an experienced distributed solar developer with a track record of energizing projects and delivering compelling financial returns. With a team specialized in development, engineering, operations, and asset management, Plankton enables PGY to aggregate projects into a diversified portfolio representing an under-served, high-potential market segment that can deliver predictable, tax-advantaged cash yield.

“The energy transition won’t happen solely on vast utility-scale fields,” said Dan Giuffrida, CEO of Plankton Energy. “It’s also taking place on rooftops, campuses, and buildings in our communities. By investing in the mid-market, we’re using existing infrastructure to generate renewable power close to where it’s consumed — improving grid reliability and accelerating decarbonization.”

Plankton Energy has developed a robust pipeline of projects across retail, industrial, office, nonprofit, and school facilities. PGY has already acquired eleven projects — three currently energized and eight in various stages of construction — that meet its financial and impact criteria. Plankton Energy is underway with development of an additional 25 projects across three northeastern states. More than half of the projects will be community solar, enabling low- and moderate-income residents to participate in the clean energy economy and save on their energy bills.

Anchoring this partnership is Gratitude Railroad, which brings more than a decade of experience in financial asset management, a committed network of investors, and a disciplined focus on opportunities that deliver both strong financial performance and meaningful impact. Identifying market gaps and shaping joint ventures are core to Gratitude’s work.

“This new fund represents a step forward for distributed clean energy,” said Rebekah Saul Butler, Managing Partner at Gratitude Railroad. “We aim to demonstrate that small commercial and community solar delivers solid financial returns alongside community benefits — reducing pollution, lowering energy costs, and powering the technologies that define our future.”

PGY recently closed a $7.5 million revolving construction facility with Locus that will enable the building of all of the portfolio projects. The fund also partners with RSF for term debt and receives additional financing through tax-credit transfers. Revenue is generated through a diversified stream of electricity sales and state incentives in the form of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs).

Amid ongoing policy shifts and evolving federal tax-credit guidance, PGY has moved decisively to leverage incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act — including community solar and domestic-content “adders,” as well as new tax-credit transferability provisions — which continue to be available for projects advancing in the lower middle market. These mechanisms expand project eligibility, increase available capital, and strengthen the economics of distributed solar, making it attractive to investors who are nimble and attuned to the policy context.

PGY meets rising investor demand for cash yield with meaningful impact at a time when reducing emissions and making energy more affordable are urgent priorities.

About the Long Island Sound Partnership The Long Island Sound Partnership, developed under the EPA’s National Estuary Program, is a cooperative effort between the EPA and the states of Connecticut and New York to protect and restore the Sound and its ecosystem.","Connecticut (December 2, 2025) – The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) and partners today announced nearly $12 million in grants to organizations and local governments to improve the health of Long Island Sound and its wildlife populations. The grants will leverage more than $8 million in matching contributions from the grantees themselves, resulting in more than $20 million in total conservation impact for projects in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont.

The 2025 Long Island Sound Futures Fund (Futures Fund) grants will support projects that:

Prevent 618,934 gallons of stormwater and 2,996 pounds of nitrogen pollution from entering the Long Island Sound

Remove 161,250 pounds of marine debris

Restore 70 acres of coastal habitat

Engage more than 300,000 people through programs that promote stewardship of the Sound

Conserve and enhance habitats for shorebirds, songbirds, diamondback terrapins, native pollinators and other wildlife

Restore fish passage for brook trout and migratory aquatic species such as alewives, blueback herring, shad and eel

Launch new oyster restoration efforts

Funding for the grant program comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the Long Island Sound Partnership (LISP), with additional support from NFWF and The Zoetis Foundation.

“Estuaries and their surrounding lands and waters represent some of the most productive wildlife habitats and most economically important areas in the world,” said Jeff Trandahl, executive director and CEO of NFWF. “The Long Island Sound is the second-largest estuary on the East Coast and one of North America’s most biologically diverse estuaries. Its watershed stretches 16,820 square miles across five states, with more than 16,000 miles of rivers feeding fresh water into the sound.

“Sustaining the health of Long Island Sound benefits a wondrous assortment of wildlife while also ensuring prosperity for thousands of communities, large and small.”

The LISP initiated the Futures Fund in 2005 through EPA’s Long Island Sound Office and NFWF. The grant program has a strong history of making environmental improvements by supporting people and communities who value the Sound and take a direct role in its future.

Since its inception, the Futures Fund has invested $68 million in 688 projects. The program has generated an additional $87 million of grantee matching contributions toward these projects for a total conservation impact of $167 million. The projects have reduced 130,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the Sound, restored 862 acres of fish and wildlife habitat, treated 212 million gallons of stormwater pollution, and engaged 5 million people in protection and restoration of the Sound.

“This year’s Futures Fund projects will support water quality improvements, habitat restoration, and other critical efforts across the watershed that are vital to protecting Long Island Sound,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Mark Sanborn. “Long Island Sound is a national treasure, and this funding exemplifies EPA’s commitment to supporting the economic and recreational benefits the Sound offers to millions of people.”

“EPA is proud to support conservation and restoration efforts in the Long Island Sound, working alongside our state and local partners,” said EPA Region 2 Administrator Michael Martucci. “These practical projects not only preserve vital ecosystems but also help build a legacy of environmental stewardship for future generations.”

“The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) stands proudly with the Long Island Sound Partnership and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in welcoming another year of impactful Futures Fund projects across the Long Island Sound Watershed,” CT DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “In Connecticut, eleven distinct NGOs took home a total of 12 awards (Save the Sound was awarded two!) for projects ranging from riparian buffers to fish passage restoration, hands-on science programs to saltmarsh restoration, and a green roof. These are just a few of the ways that today’s grantees are embracing this funding opportunity to further the health of our resources and residents across the Long Island Sound Watershed.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said ""DEC is committed to protecting Long Island Sound, one of New York’s most important natural resources, a vital economic engine, and a place cherished by communities along its shores. The Futures Fund supports projects that strengthen the Sound’s ecosystem by improving water quality, restoring habitats, and encouraging local stewardship, while reflecting a shared commitment with our partners at EPA, NFWF, and CTDEEP. DEC applauds the awardees for the meaningful benefits their work will deliver.""

FW: What is the outlook for renewable energy in 2026 and beyond?
In addition, interest and inflation rates will likely eventually moderate, thus making renewable energy projects more viable.","FW: What do you see as the most transformative trends currently reshaping the global renewable energy landscape?

McWilliams: The global renewable energy landscape is shifting from climate-first to security-driven economics. China, Europe and the US now prioritise supply chain resilience and industrial competitiveness alongside long-term 2050 goals. China’s dominance – over 80 percent of solar manufacturing, 75 percent of batteries and 95 to 97 percent of rare earth processing – creates structural dependencies that the policies of other countries are aiming to unravel. A further structural trend is artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) rapidly rising electricity demand: industry projections suggest data centres could exceed Japan’s consumption by 2030, with grid bottlenecks already delaying around 20 percent of new projects. Renewables overtook coal as the largest source of global power in early 2025, but further gains depend on also allocating capital to grid infrastructure, storage and industrial electrification, where significant system-wide returns may now sit.

Duman: While the current economic and political climate has slowed down investments in renewable energy projects in certain jurisdictions and renewable energy developers and operators are contending with higher interest and inflation rates, more expensive renewable energy projects and a weakening of state government support and incentives – as demonstrated by the US federal government’s opposition to offshore wind projects, as well as the UK government’s recent consultation paper to change or pause the inflation escalator index for UK renewable energy credits – renewable energy still continues to remain a focus globally with global renewable power output continuing to increase rapidly. As a result, renewable energy developers have become more circumspect and selective with their investments. In this more selective environment, solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind continue to be the backbone of new renewable capacity. According to the International Energy Agency, around 95 percent of the next wave of renewables are likely to come from solar PV and onshore wind. Cheap solar in particular continues to be transformational, with declining module costs, faster installation and modularity – from rooftop to utility scale – pushing solar deeper into emerging markets. One of the biggest barriers to high renewables penetration is variability and the growing need for stable energy. Energy storage, especially battery storage, is developing at pace, both in scale and cost reduction.

Moir: Geopolitical tensions are fuelling volatility in energy markets, and in some regions, consensus on the energy transition is being questioned. Against this backdrop, four trends are reshaping the global renewable energy landscape. First, electricity demand is growing faster than overall energy demand, driven by AI adoption, electrified transport and cooling systems, while renewables dominate new capacity additions. Second, rapid electrification and renewable deployment are exposing grid constraints as a critical bottleneck, with connection queues far exceeding available capacity, highlighting the need for major transmission upgrades. Third, grid flexibility is becoming essential – integrating intermittent renewables requires assets that stabilise the grid, including short and long duration storage, such as batteries, hydrogen and pumped hydro, nuclear, including small modular reactors, dispatchable low-carbon power, and gas power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Finally, governments are responding to inflationary pressures by lowering the cost of capital and consumer prices through long term, transparent frameworks such as contracts for difference (CfDs), capacity markets and regulated asset base (RAB)-style models.

FW: How are recent advances in energy storage technologies changing the economics and reliability of renewable power systems?

Duman: Battery storage operators are now using AI to analyse complex and large datasets such as weather patterns, historical data and market prices to forecast energy needs and renewable energy output from solar and wind facilities. Analysis has shown that the forecasts of such AI models are 25 percent more accurate than forecasts using traditional methods. By using such AI models, battery storage operators are able to predict energy supply and demand more accurately and navigate the peaks and troughs of energy supply and demand more accurately, thus allowing them to maximise the arbitrage between the electricity they purchase from the grid and store in their battery systems during troughs, and the electricity they sell and discharge to the grid during peaks.

Moir: Recent advances in electricity storage are transforming the economics and reliability of renewable power systems. Storage is shifting from a niche role in ancillary services to a core component of system infrastructure. Falling battery costs and wider price spreads enable profitable arbitrage and co-location with wind and solar, reducing curtailment and negative pricing risk, improving revenue stability and project bankability. Long-duration electricity storage (LDES) is gaining traction, supported by mechanisms such as the UK’s cap-and-floor regime and Italy’s MACSE auctions, which de-risk debt and enhance financing. As short-term markets saturate, flexible resources and duration diversity become essential to manage multi-hour renewable lulls, intermittency and seasonal swings. Battery storage is now central to the energy transition, which is critical for higher renewable penetration amid grid constraints and rising electricity demand. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal storage to become increasingly important as renewables dominate supply.

McWilliams: Energy storage economics have flipped dramatically – global battery demand in one week of 2024 exceeded total annual demand a decade prior, reaching 1TWh for the first time. China’s control of over 75 percent of battery cell manufacturing delivers cost advantage through vertical integration and scale. Lithium-ion batteries have become cheaper despite raw material volatility, enhancing renewable project viability by mitigating intermittency. Beyond batteries, the EU leads in liquid air storage while pumped hydro delivers 46GW of EU capacity. Sodium-ion, flow batteries and solid-state technologies help diversify risks. However, regulatory frameworks and supply chain constraints for critical minerals remain challenges. Policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), EU Battery Regulation and UK Energy Act provide clarity on recycling mandates and manufacturing incentives, de-risking long-term storage investments essential for renewable reliability at scale.

FW: To what extent are policy frameworks like the Inflation Reduction Act or the EU Green Deal driving long-term investment in renewables?

McWilliams: The US IRA is reshaping deployment economics, mobilising over $1 trillion in projected investment through 2032. Solar additions are tracking around 40-50 percent above pre-IRA expectations, with around three-quarters of new clean energy investment flowing into below-median income counties. This reverses longstanding patterns of uneven regional investment and arises at a time when COP30’s Baku to Belém Roadmap targets $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035. The EU Green Deal is positioning wind as both a climate solution and a strategic industry, supporting around 300,000 jobs today and projected to become Europe’s largest power source by 2027. Policy risk remains, but framing decarbonisation through energy security has proven more politically durable and continues to anchor long-term private investment.

Moir: Investors seek certainty, stable policy and transparency. Political risk, including upcoming elections, often deters investment. A recent example is the uncertainty surrounding the IRA, which has shaken investor confidence in the US, delaying capital flows into renewable assets and slowing the energy transition. In contrast, Europe and the UK have earned credibility through stable frameworks like CfDs, capacity markets and regulated models, such as RAB for carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and storage, and new nuclear. These mechanisms are designed to reduce financing costs by providing predictable cash flows. Initiatives in the UK, such as Clean Power 2030 and targeted support for LDES, reinforce long-term commitments to renewables, flexibility and low-carbon dispatchable power. The lesson is clear – complex or shifting rules and political reversals deter investment. Stability, simplicity and credible delivery remain the decisive catalysts for attracting long-term capital.

Duman: Policy frameworks have been highly effective in attracting private capital to investments in renewable energy projects, by creating stable investment regimes and promising predictable investment returns for private investors. Indeed, both the IRA and the EU’s Green Deal have been recognised for rallying hundreds of billions of dollars of private investments into renewable energy projects, while creating and reskilling workers for numerous high-quality, well-paying jobs in the renewables sector. However, investors have become more cautious with respect to policy frameworks, noting that they can be easily withdrawn due to a change in governments or political headwinds and they can also lead to malinvestments in the renewables sector.

FW: What role do you foresee for green hydrogen in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors by 2026 and beyond?

Moir: Green hydrogen is entering early deployment, with its near-term role concentrated in hard-to-abate sectors where electrification is not feasible. Industrial heat, refining, chemicals and sustainable aviation fuel remain the most promising applications, but only if costs decrease. However, the buzz around green hydrogen a few years ago has started to fade, with many projects being delayed or cancelled – even those that have received generous government subsidies – and several players deciding to leave the market entirely. Aside from the challenging economics, the two key challenges being faced are the lack of an offtake market and of large-scale transportation and storage infrastructure. There simply is not a broad market of creditworthy offtakers willing to commit to long-term contracts with material potential liabilities, particularly if it may involve material capital expenditure to enable the facility or asset to use hydrogen or increased operational risk. And the lack of existing infrastructure heightens the risk of there being a single point of failure, for both the supplier and the offtaker, with no easy way to mitigate. If green hydrogen is to fulfil its potential, governments will need to address both these issues, including helping to solve the ‘chicken and egg’ issue in relation to building new infrastructure.

Duman: While hard-to-abate sectors are major contributors to global CO2 emissions – the production of steel, cement and fertiliser accounts for approximately 9 percent, 8 percent and 2 percent of annual global emissions respectively – the products of such sectors are necessary for human development, and we can only expect global usage of such products, and related CO2 emissions, to grow as the world population increases and global living standards rise. Therefore, green hydrogen will have a key role in the decarbonisation of these industries as it remains the most promising solution to this conundrum. However, large scale green hydrogen technology is still in its infancy and further investments, government support and incentives, alongside continued research and development, will likely be required to further develop and scale-up the technology.

McWilliams: By 2026, green hydrogen will primarily scale in sectors where consumers or manufacturers can absorb a sustainability premium, notably green steel and low-carbon logistics. China holds more than 60 percent of global electrolyser manufacturing, replicating the pattern seen in solar and batteries and complicating reshoring efforts elsewhere. Recent demonstrations show viable hydrogen use in glass, ceramics and minerals processing, with feedstock replacement and seasonal storage expected to follow. Hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and aviation will rely on hydrogen-derived fuels, while blue hydrogen provides transitional volumes because it can be produced at industrial scale using existing gas infrastructure, bridging supply until green hydrogen becomes cost-competitive. Infrastructure remains the constraint, as pipelines, storage and port facilities must develop in parallel with demand. Amid all of this, companies are increasingly structuring contracts to preserve optionality as hydrogen economics evolve.

FW: How are supply chain vulnerabilities and critical mineral dependencies influencing project timelines and costs in the renewable sector?

Duman: The supply chain shocks stemming from recent events – ranging from the Houthi rebels’ attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, to tariff wars over solar panels and critical and rare earth minerals – have pushed the issue of supply chain vulnerabilities to the forefront of renewable project developers’ minds. Developers now have to plan for mitigants to counteract such vulnerabilities, including rerouting supply chains, finding contingency suppliers or replacing suppliers altogether, and purchasing more expensive insurance policies – all of which results in more costs for the project and potentially extensions to the project timeline. In relation to tariffs on supplies and equipment for renewable projects, developers are now keen to negotiate with their counterparties to allocate liability for unforeseen tariffs.

McWilliams: Supply chain brittleness is now the primary cause of renewable project delays, regardless of policy support. The 2025 US-Australia critical minerals framework, which is an $8.5bn pipeline with $1bn initial financing, highlights geopolitical realignment as Australia navigates friendshoring with other allies and while China tightens rare earth export controls. Analysts still expect 10-20 years before meaningful supply independence, with diversification constrained by China’s structural dominance comprising 95-97 percent of rare earth processing and major control of polysilicon. Operational limits compound these pressures because, even when materials are available, shortages in engineering capacity, fabrication and specialised installation vessels slow the shift from approval to construction. The UK faces a 1-2GW annual solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) shortfall, and vessel scarcity threatens delivery of roughly 42GW of approved offshore wind capacity, requiring near-doubling of installation capability. In this environment of structural constraint, nickel, cobalt and graphite may stabilise, but copper risks a 30 percent deficit by the mid-2030s. Developers are therefore lengthening procurement windows and adding escalation clauses, yet mine development cycles of 7-10 years mean supply cannot adjust quickly.

Moir: Supply chain vulnerabilities and critical mineral dependencies are increasingly shaping renewable project timelines and costs. Geopolitical tensions have exposed concentration risks, with China controlling most lithium, cobalt and rare earth refining. Export restrictions and price volatility for copper, steel and specialised components, compounded by tariffs and inflation, are extending lead times and raising EPC costs. Added scrutiny of Chinese components for environmental, social and governance, as well as cyber and broader national security concerns, are further tightening terms and affecting bankability. Offshore wind illustrates the challenge, as long waits for heavy-lift vessels, turbines, high voltage direct current cables and other key components are slowing deployment. Developers are responding with longer, more collaborative procurement, earlier supplier engagement and more robust standardised supply contracts, covering contingencies such as force majeure, change in law, and so on, realistic schedules and cost-control provisions. Governments are rolling out industrial strategies and port upgrades, but these measures will take time. For now, proactive risk management and disciplined planning remain essential to protect returns.

FW: In your view, how is digitalisation through AI, smart grids and the internet of things enabling more efficient and scalable deployment of renewables?

Moir: Digitalisation has shifted from being an add-on to a core enabler of renewable integration and scalability. AI-driven optimisation improves dispatch, revenue stacking and battery cycling strategies across multiple markets, while predictive maintenance reduces downtime and extends asset life. Smart grids and advanced system planning, centralised through bodies like the National Energy System Operator, use real-time data to prioritise reinforcements, manage congestion and unlock connections, moving from ‘first-come’ to ‘first-ready and needed’. At the edge, internet of things (IoT) devices enable consumer-led flexibility, complementing utility-scale storage and interconnectors, though progress has been slower than expected. Meanwhile, the AI and data centre boom driving demand is also catalysing flexible power purchase agreements and co-location with low-carbon dispatchable power. These projects benefit from low-cost integration at scale and the creditworthiness of offtakers, often major tech companies.

McWilliams: AI, IoT and digital grid controls are enabling more efficient renewable deployment and simultaneously increasing system stress. AI-enabled building and industrial management systems can cut energy use by 16-36 percent, easing peak loads at a time when global grids may need 80 million kilometres of new transmission by 2040. China leads large-scale smart grid rollout, using AI-controlled microgrids and smart inverters to integrate solar and storage while creating new revenue opportunities through virtual power plants. IoT sensors improve real-time grid visibility and fault detection, yet AI’s power demand is rising fast, pushing data centre developers to choose locations based on power availability rather than network infrastructure, with many planning onsite generation, including renewable sources, by 2030. The constraints are, however, familiar – high upfront costs, interoperability issues, cyber security exposure and regulatory lag. Coordinated investment in both digital and physical grid infrastructure is essential for renewables to scale reliably.

Duman: The digitalisation of the entire energy ecosystem will allow all stakeholders to better optimise their production, transmission and consumption of electricity, for example by improving the collection of energy data, which will then be used for more accurate energy demand and supply forecasts. It may also improve the monitoring and control of electrical grid balance, especially for the purposes of energy storage and integration of renewable energy facilities into the grid. End-users will also be provided with real-time information of their energy usage to enable them to make more informed decisions on their energy consumption. Digitalisation is also likely to increase the grid’s resilience with automated fault detection and mitigation measures. All of these effects will help overcome the wider public’s two main bugbears of renewable energy – its intermittent nature and perceived high cost of electricity production – and hopefully make the widespread deployment of renewable energy more attractive.

FW: What is the outlook for renewable energy in 2026 and beyond? How might supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and social equity concerns influence future demand?

McWilliams: The outlook for 2026 and beyond is defined by strong ambition but uneven capacity. COP30’s Baku-Belém Roadmap targets $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance by 2035, but delivery depends on navigating China’s dominance across manufacturing and materials. Geopolitical tensions, particularly those linked to Russia, have also accelerated Europe’s pursuit of energy independence, boosting renewables even as supply chain bottlenecks slow deployment. Vessel shortages, rare earth dependencies and limited construction capacity remain critical risks that policy cannot resolve quickly. Social equity will shape political durability. Renewables create substantial jobs, but legacy energy workforce transitions must be actively managed to maintain support. Upfront system costs remain a barrier for low-income households despite improving economics. The outlook for 2026 and beyond depends on balancing these tensions. Countries that deepen domestic supply chains, secure critical minerals and manage social transitions effectively will capture outsize investment and deployment growth through the late 2020s.

Duman: Renewable energy technology is still becoming cheaper and more efficient, and this will continue to drive the investment case for the renewables sector. In addition, interest and inflation rates will likely eventually moderate, thus making renewable energy projects more viable. Finally, the trend of deglobalisation, which has been one of the root causes for supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and social equity concerns, could work toward solving some of the issues the sector currently faces as a result of governments’ focus on developing onshore industries – eventually leading to an increase in domestic manufacturing and enhanced national energy security.

Moir: We expect that renewables, storage and nuclear will continue to grow, driven by economics, electrification and AI mainstream adoption. The main constraint remains grid infrastructure. Transmission build-out, both on and offshore, the integration of flexible assets and connection reforms will determine how quickly queued projects reach commercial operations date. Due to the penetration of renewables, we expect more volatility and seasonality in power markets, increasing the value of flexibility and long-duration storage. Supply chain pressures should ease gradually with industrial policy, such as US nearshoring, but vessel availability, critical mineral diversification and geopolitics will continue to shape costs. Trade tariffs, election cycles and policy reversals will influence investor appetite and financing costs. Markets with stable, simple frameworks and credible delivery will attract capital. Finally, governments must manage consumer costs and deliver local benefits, including jobs and infrastructure upgrades, to maintain public acceptance and political stability.

Canada’s Gibson Energy just renewed decades-long contracts at its key Edmonton terminal, greenlit a new US infrastructure project, and laid out a fully funded growth and maintenance budget for 2026.

What does this mean?

Gibson Energy renewed a 20-year take-or-pay refined products services deal and added another 10 years to a terminal storage take-or-pay agreement at its Edmonton, Alberta terminal with major integrated oil sands customers. Those take-or-pay contracts guarantee Gibson a minimum level of revenue whether or not customers use the full capacity, smoothing cash flows in a volatile commodity world. The firm says these extensions prove the growing demand for its infrastructure and highlight how essential the Edmonton terminal is to oil sands producers’ logistics. South of the border, Gibson has approved a new infrastructure project in Texas that will tie into its Wink-to-Gateway system, supporting US-led growth. To back all this up, the company issued 2026 growth capital guidance of C$150 million – including about C$50 million of already sanctioned spend – plus a C$50–60 million replacement capital program, stressing that its 2026 plan is fully funded from existing resources.

Why should I care?

Markets: Locked-in cash flows soothe energy sector nerves.

Long-term take-or-pay contracts are prized in the midstream world because they provide clear visibility on future revenue, regardless of short-term oil price swings. By renewing a 20-year refined products agreement and tacking on 10 more years of storage services, Gibson is effectively pinning down a big slice of its future earnings with bond-like cash streams. That kind of stability can help support valuations and dividends in a sector where plenty of rivals still lean on more volume-sensitive, shorter-term deals. And with the Texas project tying into Wink-to-Gateway, Gibson is signaling that capital is still flowing into North American oil logistics, hinting that investors expect steady demand for oil sands and Permian barrels even as the energy transition rolls on.

The bigger picture: Pipelines still shape the energy transition’s messy middle.

Oil sands producers need dependable storage and transportation to keep exports flowing, and Gibson’s Edmonton terminal is part of that backbone. When “senior integrated oil sands customers” commit to 10–20 years of service, they are effectively betting on meaningful production and refining activity well into the 2040s, despite mounting climate policy pressure. At the same time, the Texas expansion and Wink-to-Gateway integration point to resilient cross-border energy trade between Canada and the US, even as both countries pour money into renewables. For policymakers and executives, that underscores a key reality: large midstream assets are still attracting multi-decade commitments, which will influence how the energy mix shifts and how capital gets split between fossil fuel and low-carbon infrastructure.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3515607_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=51712c2911317f791a3052e388c11439,N,,2025-12-02 12:04:04.381309

Total sales declined 0.9% to 164,925 vehicles for the month. Dealer services provider Cox Automotive Inc. forecasted U.S. sales for the industry would fall to 1.27 million in November, down 7.8% from last year. Two fewer selling days, the end of the federal EV tax credit and higher vehicle prices from tariffs affected the total.

Sales of F-Series pickups, the country's best-selling trucks and the Dearborn automaker's profit engine, fell 9.6%. Multiple fires at an aluminum sheet plant in New York over the past seven weeks halted electric F-150 Lightning production and disrupted Super Duty and F-150 volumes.

Ford expects to make up some of the lost production next year with an added shift at Dearborn Truck Plant and additional workers at Kentucky Truck plant. It's not clear when F-150 Lightning manufacturing will resume, and reports have suggested Ford is considering ending the program. The company plans to launch in 2028 a next-generation electric full-size pickup at its new BlueOval City plant in Tennessee.

The decision to suspend Lightning production came after the end of the federal tax credit. That's part of a campaign by the administration of President Donald Trump to dismantle what he has termed an ""EV mandate"" on consumers. It comes alongside efforts to revoke California's waiver to set its own tailpipe emissions standards that other state can adopt and to roll back federal emissions requirements.

Despite the EV drop, consumers did embrace some form of electrification: Hybrids were up 14%, being a more flexible option for buyers with EV range anxiety. Gas- and diesel-powered vehicles were up 2.2%, as dealers look to sell off 2025 model-year cars, trucks and SUVs.

Total truck sales were flat, while SUV deliveries declined 4.9% with the electric Mustang Mach-E down 49%. The Mustang coupe rose 79%. The Lincoln luxury brand declined 12%.

For SUVs, Expedition, whose production also was hit by the Novelis Inc. aluminum plant fires, was down 8.8%. Escape fell 32% ahead of the end of its production for retooling at Louisville Assembly Plant for an electric midsize truck built on the next-generation Universal EV Platform and Production System. Explorer grew 42%. Bronco was up 7%, but Bronco Sport fell 4.1%.

F-150 Lightning sales declined 72%. Ranger midsize truck grew 36%. Maverick small pickup was up 43%. Transit commercial van rose 17%, while the E-Transit fell 82%. General Motors Co. said last month it was ending production of its Chevrolet BrightDrop electric vans built in Canada.

At Lincoln, Navigator and Aviator rose 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Nautilus fell 30% and Corsair, which is ending production alongside the Escape, declined 12%.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” is the cornerstone of the plan and involves significant tax cuts, which the administration argues will unleash rapid economic growth. The belief is that this accelerated growth will generate a larger tax base, ultimately leading to greater tax revenues that will help pay down the debt.

Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other non-partisan analysts, have estimated that the net effect of the tax plan, when fully accounted for, will likely add several trillion dollars to the national debt over the next decade due to lost revenue.

The administration’s trade strategy, which includes imposing new tariffs on imported goods, claims these duties will generate “trillions of dollars” for the federal government, providing a new source of revenue to offset the deficit. However, based on recent estimates from non-partisan economic think tanks, the new tariffs are generally projected to generate revenue in the range of $200 billion to $240 billion in 2026.

The final, official figure for the Fiscal Year 2025 federal budget deficit is estimated to be approximately $1.8 trillion based on the final estimates and reporting from the Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Treasury Department. For the first time, net interest payments on the national debt surpassed $1 trillion due to both high debt levels and higher interest rates.

Spending on major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continued to rise significantly, growing by about 8% collectively. While revenues increased overall due to individual income and payroll taxes, this was partially offset by a decline in corporate tax receipts, potentially due to new tax deductions.

What could be a genuine game changer in attacking the $38 trillion federal debt is the speed and magnitude of the reshoring of foreign manufacturing to U.S. states. When looking at potential future revenue streams, aside from raising taxes to offset deficit spending, generating hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs that work in tandem with AI is a viable option that carries large tax revenue implications.

There are no specific estimates of future tax revenue from the reshoring of manufacturing. Reshoring generates tax revenue through two primary mechanisms, the largest being increased payroll and income taxes, and corporate and investment taxes. It is touted by reshoring proponents that when a manufacturing facility moves back to the United States or expands, it creates domestic jobs that generate significant tax revenue.

The second primary source of tax receipts is revenue from the profits of the new or expanded U.S.-based manufacturing companies, as well as revenue from taxes on capital investment, new construction and local property taxes for the new facilities. But reshoring is heavily incentivized by federal acts (like the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, etc.) and state programs. These incentives often include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation and exemptions that reduce the immediate taxable income, lowering the initial tax revenue. Hence, specific revenue estimates are elusive.

But the potential numbers look promising. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, there is a total impact of $2.65 to the overall U.S. economy. In addition, for every one worker in manufacturing, 4.8 workers are added to the overall U.S. economy. This figure represents one of the largest sectoral multipliers in the economy. In 2024, manufacturing workers in the United States earned $106,691 on average, including pay and benefits. For all categories of manufacturing workers, average hourly earnings were $35.50, up 3.9% year over year.

Over the next decade, because of organic growth and reshoring efforts, 3.8 million manufacturing jobs will likely be needed, and 1.9 million are expected to be unfilled if more people do not pursue modern manufacturing careers. Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute found that of open jobs, 2.8 million will come from retirement and 760,000 from industry growth, and an estimated 230,000 jobs will be created from recent legislative and regulatory actions.

America leads the world in innovation, and manufacturers in the United States perform 52.9% of all private-sector R&D in the nation, driving more innovation than any other sector. R&D in the manufacturing sector has risen from $132.5 billion in 2000 to a record $404.8 billion in 2023. In the most recent data, pharmaceuticals accounted for 36.1% of all manufacturing R&D, spending $146.1 billion in 2023. Semiconductor and other electronic components (13.7%), other computer and electronic manufacturing (13.6%) and motor vehicles and parts (9.6%) also contributed significantly to R&D spending in 2023, with each hitting new all-time high levels of R&D for the year. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis)

At a time when there is growing concern about AI-related job destruction in several service sectors of the economy, the ramping up of reshoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing is timely. With retirements rising and digital fluency growing, manufacturers are capturing institutional knowledge, redesigning roles for human-machine collaboration and upskilling at scale.

Decarbonization is taking on new importance among companies who must reduce emissions to meet investor & customer expectations, while also delivering enterprise value. It is not a coincidence that decarbonization, when done correctly, enables companies to fulfill both obligations, given how interwoven emissions are with commercial value.

This third and final blog in our three-part series on operational decarbonization explores how companies can use tailored building management to reduce their real estate-based emissions while also bolstering operational performance. As with our first two blogs on industrial heat and fleets, we highlight real-world case studies to bring building sector decarbonization to life and highlight the unique challenges and opportunities associated with emissions across the built environment.

Reducing building sector emissions is a win-win for companies

Globally, energy used directly within buildings and for generating electricity and heat for buildings accounts for 26 percent of all energy-related emissions.These emissions are largely driven by electricity imports and fossil fuels such as natural gas, used for building heating applications.

The significant energy consumption giving rise to these emissions is naturally a major cost for building owners and occupiers, making reductions attractive both from an economic and emissions perspective.

Given these factors, reducing building energy consumption is a growing focus for building owners and occupiers, as is reducing associated emissions by switching to cleaner energy sources. The technologies needed to accomplish both objectives are mature and proven. Heating needs, for example, can be addressed by adopting heat pumps or connecting to heat networks and improving the building fabric with more efficient insulation and glazing solutions, as well as lighting upgrades. Building owners and occupiers can leverage smart technologies linked to advanced building management systems to optimize energy use, while also benefiting from the rapid growth of on-site renewables to generate low-cost, zero-carbon electricity.

There are clear benefits to tackling building energy use and reducing emissions. For example, building owners are more likely to attract tenants seeking a space with lower operating costs and who increasingly have emissions targets to meet, sometimes commanding a rent premium. Mandatory energy efficiency standards are also increasingly common. Thus, improving building performance helps avoid stranded assets, while also potentially offering access to preferential lending terms and higher valuations from sustainability-focused investors.

With real estate-based emissions being such a significant source of emissions for most companies, tackling them is a critical part of achieving any corporate-wide emissions reduction target. When paired with the cost savings from lower energy bills, building emissions reductions represent a major commercial opportunity.

Call to action

To get started on building decarbonization, consider the following practical steps and read on to see how real-world companies are putting them into action.

Unlock hidden savings: Conduct a building energy audit to identify cost savings and emissions reduction opportunities through building efficiency improvements.

Invest in future-proof technologies: Invest in proven technologies like heat pumps, smart building management systems, and on-site renewables to increase operational efficiencies and attract tenants.

Move ahead of the curve: Avoid stranded assets, access preferential lending terms and higher valuations, and meet emerging energy efficiency standards by investing in building emissions reductions now.

Case study one

The situation

A global leisure and entertainment company with a portfolio of more than 120 sites worldwide sought a costed emissions reduction roadmap for its buildings portfolio to support its company-wide net zero target, and deliver an increased enterprise value via lower opex and an enhanced customer proposition.pe

The solution

ERM identified several sites that were representative of the company’s full portfolio, including a theme park, aquarium, museum, and mixed leisure attraction, before conducting deep-dive energy and carbon assessments on each archetype to establish its energy use profile.

For each archetype, ERM assessed a suite of carbon reduction measures, including energy efficiencies, on-site renewables, renewable energy procurement, and electrification of fossil fuel heating, cooling, and food preparation.

ERM then calculated emission impacts, costs, and benefits for the company’s full portfolio, adjusting for local climate and energy mixes at all global sites.

Lastly, ERM recommended measures to reduce the GHG emissions of the company’s building portfolio by over 90 percent. Key recommendations included: upgrades to heating, ventilation, cooling systems, lighting, motors, and pumps; installing rooftop and car-park solar photovoltaics; and procuring renewable electricity.

The impact

The site evaluation found that 73 percent of the building portfolio’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions could be eliminated with a total investment of just under $50 million. Furthermore, these measures all had a positive net present value or had no net cost impact.

ERM identified a further 20 percent of Scope 1 and 2 emissions that could be eliminated for an average cost of ~$100/tonne CO2

The assessment identified highly attractive energy efficiency measures, delivering GHG emissions savings of nearly 20 percent of base year emissions with payback periods of less than two years.

Lessons learned

Rapid progress towards an actionable decarbonization plan for large portfolios can be achieved through an ‘archetype-driven’ analysis focused on a sample of representative sites.

Companies can quickly evaluate and implement emissions reduction measures relevant to their global building portfolio, while accounting for regional climate and energy market contexts.

Layered assessments of multiple building decarbonization options can identify significant concurrent benefits, including operational cost savings, access to more favorable financing, and enhanced revenue protection.

Case study two

The situation

An automotive parts manufacturer with more than 60 manufacturing sites worldwide pursued energy consumption reductions across its site portfolio, using external capital funding through an Energy Saving as a Service (ESaaS) program.

The solution

ERM personnel applied a four-phase approach:

Identified Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) based on data collected from each site, on-site and remote audits of the manufacturer’s portfolio, plus workshops with local site teams. ERM personnel held workshops with each site team to “fill the gaps”, jointly, where there was missing data.

Secured funding for these ECMs, using a mix of energy supplier funding and performance guarantees.

Installed and commissioned the new

Delivered maintenance services for the installed equipment and provided active energy performance management via a dedicated digital platform to generate additional energy savings and drive behavioral change among employees (e.g., using energy more efficiently).

The impact

ERM personnel conducted audits on more than 60 sites across 10 countries and identified more than 250 ECMs and installed and commissioned the new equipment.

Over 500 GWh of energy use is now monitored for the manufacturer through a dedicated energy monitoring platform.

The above actions delivered an annual energy reduction of more than 10 percent across the site portfolio, representing annual CO2 savings of 40,000 tonnes, with no upfront investment by the company. Furthermore, the manufacturer achieved annual estimated cost savings of €6.2 million.

Lessons learned

Complex global companies can achieve significant energy and carbon reductions by implementing energy savings programs, with little or no capital investment, leveraging supplier funding and performance guarantees.

Data gaps do not have to block Companies can fill gaps via collaborative workshops with local site teams who better understand the specifics of their own operations and buildings portfolio.

Companies considering their own energy savings programs should ensure that their approaches are holistic (i.e., site- and company-wide, including process improvements) and verifiable through a comprehensive metering & monitoring campaign.

Conclusion

Our three-part blog series on operational decarbonization demonstrates how targeted emissions reduction initiatives can enhance corporate resiliency and performance amidst recent shifts in the business and geopolitical landscapes. These benefits are not exclusive to a select few companies. With the right actions, organizations operating across all sectors can access them regardless of their operational circumstances.

Taking lessons learned from the case studies covered above, companies with significant real-estate/built environment assets can translate decarbonization from ambition to actuality, reaping benefits along the way. Remember these key takeaways.

With the absence of the EV tax credit, automakers are predicting a market-wide slowdown over the next few quarters, and that puts brands in a weird limbo where executives expect the electric vehicle segment to stagnate despite the billions of dollars in recent investments.

But there's one market that automakers seem to be ignoring: the commercial one. It might seem obvious, but business-to-business sales aren't exactly paying the bills like the consumer auto market. They could be, though, and that's what one former General Motors executive is betting big on.

30%: Automakers Are Retreating From Consumer EVs, But The Commercial Market Is Begging For Them

ZMD Truck Render

Former General Motors executive Dave Stenson believes that automakers are going about this perceived EV slowdown all wrong. While the big three in Detroit are seemingly leading a pullback in all things electric, Stenson is instead throwing his John DeLorean card onto the table and betting that his new startup has unlocked the secret to the next stage of electrification.

Stenson knows the drill—after all, he spent three decades in Detroit working through the algorithm of high-margin, high-volume consumer sales. Sell crossovers to suburbanites and the F-150s of the world. But when the government unstacks the deck and EVs no longer have a competitive edge, what can automakers do to ensure their new powertrains stay competitive?

Enter ZMD Motors, a startup that believes mainstream automakers have misjudged the timeline and approach to electrification. Essentially, ZMD is aiming to break the mold by moving into the medium-duty truck market. Stenson and ZMD see these platformed vehicles are the next big thing in the EV space.

Here's what Stenson revealed in an interview with Automotive News:

Stenson’s ultimate goal is to fill an untapped niche: the electrified Class 5 work truck category, to which the Ford F-550, Ram 5500 and Silverado 5500 belong. It’s been untapped for a reason, though. Automakers focused on light-duty, high-volume EVs first. Heavy-duty electrification poses unique challenges — range limitation being high on the list — with even less certain ROI prospects than light-duty electrics.

[...] The opportunity might be tough to see from Detroit, but in California, the business case is clear, Stenson said in an interview with Automotive News affiliate Crain’s Detroit Business.

“Nobody has brought a pickup cab-based, medium-duty EV to market,” Stenson said. “Whether it’s diesel or gas, you go out to California, and they don’t want either. They want electric where it fits their work needs.”

I know that you're just begging to hear about the next company that promises what might as well be vaporware. But ZMD's approach could just be the missing link in EV adoption.

See, the commercial segment of the auto industry is a completely different beast from passenger cars. Government, utility companies, construction firms and the like aren't shopping for the next big thing or a screen the size of a small TV. These consumers just want consistency and practicality, which gives brands an opportunity to focus on the tech and execution that can not only sustain a vehicle program but also build tech that will flow into the passenger car market in the future.

ZMD's truck-sized holes are the Class 5 work trucks. This opportunity represents an annual volume output of around 80,000 units. That's hardly an earth-shattering figure—GM sold nearly double that in passenger EVs through Q3 so far this year. But it is the perfect volume for a small startup that is eyeing up trucks with an ideal operating radius of less than 100 miles.

California in particular, is basically a goldmine in the waiting:

Electric medium-duty truck is a segment in high demand in California ZMD’s focus is on utility bucket trucks, municipal service trucks and the like, which make up a small but growing piece of the medium-duty niche. In California, there is huge demand for the product segment, said Daryl Trueblood, general manager at North Highland, Calif.-based vehicle upfitter One Stop Truck & Equipment.

Stenson's pitch is for automakers to supply the cab and chassis, then let ZMD do the rest. This lets both companies take a foothold in the Class 5 market while also supplying companies with a product that they so desperately want.

Will it work? Maybe. But what's keeping automakers from simply pivoting and copying ZMD's homework?

60%: Nvidia Gives Everyone The Brain Behind Self-Driving Cars

Nvidia Lidar

Nvidia has decided that if the world insists on building self-driving cars, it might as well give everyone a brain smart enough to handle the task.

The company officially released its newest self-driving model, Alpamayo-R1, this week. Nvidia is pitching it as the Rosetta Stone of robot driving that uses natural language to describe exactly what it sees and then acts on that description accordingly. Reuters explains:

On Monday, Nvidia released Alpamayo-R1 for self-driving vehicles. The software is what is known as a ""vision-language-action"" AI model, which means that the self-driving vehicle translates what its sensor banks see on the road into a description using natural language. [...]

For example, if the car sees a bike path, it will note that it sees the path and is adjusting course.

This seems like a basic problem to solve, but one of the biggest problems that engineers have reiterated time and time again is how difficult it can be to understand how self-driving models make the decisions they do. But with a model that describes its reasoning in an easy-to-understand natural language, that black box problem is less and less of a concern.

Most previous self-driving car software was limited in how it explained why the car chose a particular path, making it hard for engineers to understand what needed to be fixed to make the cars safer.

""One of the entire motivations behind making this open is so that developers and researchers can... understand how these models work so we can, as an industry, come up with standard ways of evaluating how they work,"" Katie Young, senior marketing manager for the automotive enterprise at Nvidia, told Reuters.

Nvidia says that the dataset has a total of 1,727 hours of recorded driving over 310,895 clips (each one about 20 seconds long). It isn't just perfect road conditions, either. The company says that it captured ""diverse traffic, weather conditions, obstacles and pedestrians"" in the model and also blends multi-camera and lidar for about half of the clips while 163,850 also have radar coverage as well. Half of the data is from U.S. roads.

If you're interested in exploring the model, you can download the dataset on Hugging Face and the developer kit on GitHub.

90%: Americans Have Had It With High Car Prices

For nearly half a decade, consumers have been paying the COVID-19 tax on new and used cars. Sticker price? Merely a suggestion as dealers are capitalizing on the ""Sure, I'll pay that!"" attitude since 2020.

But Americans have finally had enough of it. The average transaction price of a new car has skyrocketed to around $50,000, while new EVs are hitting a high of $59,125.

Those same dealerships are now noticing it in their sales trends. Analysts are also seeing in car-buying data that cars sit on lots for longer periods of time, and cash-on-the-hood discounts (which seemingly went extinct as the chip shortage started) are even making a comeback. The Wall Street Journal spills what's on consumers' minds:

Car buyers are downsizing, buying used vehicles, taking on longer car loans and holding out for deals.

“People are asking, ‘How can I afford this?’” said Robert Peltier, who owns dealerships in East Texas. He said traffic, while still solid, has slowed at his dealerships and more customers are gravitating toward less-costly cars such as the pint-size Chevrolet Trax. “There are people who are in debt and living paycheck to paycheck.”

This is kind of an unexpected, dramatic turn. 2025 was meant to be a victory lap—tax cuts, deregulation and American factories humming with domestic production that pump out affordable, home-grown cars. Basically, another year of people buying anything with four wheels and a made-in-America stamping.

But that's not what happened. Instead, the EV market is facing an anticipated collapse with Q4 being just the start. The loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit seemingly yanked thousands of theoretical sales off the board.

The loss of new car sales isn't just limited to electric cars, either. Gas cars are also showing signs of a downturn with fewer sales and longer times-to-turn. Some lenders are even easing up on their borrowing requirements, while auto loan defaults are encroaching on levels similar to the 2008 recession.

More from the WSJ:

Signs of strain are beginning to show up in the data. Cars are sitting longer on dealer lots. Dealers are piling on extra discounts to make sales. Lower-income borrowers are defaulting on car loans. Americans as a whole are spending less overall on vehicle purchases than they did a year ago.

“Other components of the economy are tugging on the consumer,” said Ivan Drury, an automotive analyst for the car-shopping website Edmunds.com. [...] The cost of car parts and repairs has climbed as well, so hanging on to old vehicles comes with its own costs. “You can’t really find relief,” Drury said.

This leaves American car buyers at an interesting crossroads. Keep an old car on the road while repair costs are soaring, or spend $50,000 on a new crossover?

Dealers know the jig is up. Discounts are rising, negotiations are back and earning your business is once again climbing the priority ladder. Meanwhile, consumers are simply refusing the notion of a $700-per-month car payment. Car buyer fever is breaking.

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 ( “Reagan Tax Cuts”) Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.","Since the creation of the federal income tax in 1913, Congress has regularly adjusted the tax code as the economy and national priorities have changed.

In this paper, the Bipartisan Policy Center presents a comprehensive timeline of major U.S. tax reform efforts from the end of World War II to the present, most recently passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). Our analysis includes the political dynamics, major policy details, and the budgetary effects of signature tax legislation throughout modern history. For this analysis, we define legislation as enacted on a bipartisan basis if its passage received at least one vote from a member of the opposite party. Our review also examines the trajectory and composition of federal revenue since the 1940s.

A few broad themes emerge from this review:

Increasing Partisanship: Tax laws were broadly bipartisan in the postwar era through the 1990s. At the turn of the century, each party started using the reconciliation process more frequently to advance partisan legislation—often including major tax revisions. Partly as a result, tax laws have become much more partisan in the 21st century than they were in the 20th.

Rising Spending and Deficits: Although this paper focuses on revenue changes, an unmistakable trend in the past quarter century has seen government spending rising as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) while revenue declined slightly. As a result, debt has been rising as a share of GDP—in good economic times and bad, in war and in peace. Major tax cuts this century have contributed to declining revenue, but significant increases in spending complete the picture.

Inflation Adjustments, then Extenders: From the 1940s through the 1970s, Congress frequently revisited the tax code because dollar amounts and thresholds were not automatically adjusted for inflation. This became a particular issue in the 1970s, as the country confronted high and persistent inflation. In 1981, Congress began automatically indexing various portions of the tax code for inflation, including income tax brackets. Since that change, lawmakers have needed to update the tax code for inflation less often. The inflation adjustments process was replaced through the 2010s with “tax extenders,” in which Congress would make temporary tax policies with an expiration date and extend them for only one or a few years at a time.

The Postwar Era: 1945-1969

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the U.S. national debt rose to the highest levels in history. Federal expenditures then fell precipitously due to the war’s end, but tax rates stayed high well into the early 1960s. It wasn’t until the end of the 1960s that Congress significantly lowered tax rates.

Revenue Act of 1945

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The federal government’s need for revenue declined quickly as WWII ended. Although the national debt was high, Congress sought to provide economic relief from higher wartime tax rates.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law had three main components. It 1) lowered all individual tax rates, with the top rate falling from 94% to 86.45%; 2) repealed the excess profits tax on companies; and 3) reduced the top corporate tax rate to 38%.

Budgetary Projection: The Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation (JCIRT, predecessor to the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT) projected that the Revenue Act of 1945would decrease revenue by $5.9 billion over the fiscal year (which ran from July-June before 1974).

Revenue Act of 1948

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Policymakers expressed a growing concern over the tax treatment of married couples in two different types of states—“community property” states and “common law” states.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law eased marriage penalties in the tax code by, for example, making it easier for two spouses in a couple to split income and allowing marital deductions for estate and gift taxes. It also increased personal exemptions and established the additional exemption for the elderly and the blind (later the additional standard deduction).

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1948 would decrease revenue by $5 billion over the full year after enactment.

Revenue Act of 1950

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The Korean War began in June 1950. The United States needed to again raise military expenditures, which slowed down efforts to provide tax relief.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law raised individual tax rates across the board, with the lowest rate increasing from 16.6% to 20%, and the top rate increasing from 82.1% to 91%. Congress raised the top corporate tax rate from 38% to 45%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1950would increase revenue by $4.5 billion over the full year.

Excess Profits Tax of 1950

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: With government spending increasing in the face of the prolonged Korean War, Congress reinstated the excess profits tax.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law placed a 30% surcharge on excess business profits, meaning that some corporations faced a marginal rate of 77% (inclusive of surtaxes and excess profits taxes).

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Excess Profits Tax of 1950would increase revenue by $3.3 billion over the full year.

Revenue Act of 1951

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As the federal government faced additional financing needs for national defense, the Truman administration asked Congress for nearly $11 billion in tax increases that would close a budget deficit of around $10 billion. Congress managed to approve $5 billion in this 1951 tax law, which one economist noted ended a long period of relative harmony between Congress and the president on tax reform.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased individual income tax rates, corporate income tax rates (basic rate from 47% to 52%); capital gains tax rates (top rate from 25% to 26%); cigarette taxes (from $0.07 per pack to $0.08); gas taxes (from $0.015 per gallon to $0.02); and a variety of other excise taxes.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1951 would increase revenue by $5.4 billion over the full year.

Internal Revenue Code of 1954

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Congress engaged in the first wholesale revision of the U.S. tax code since 1876, “renumbering every section” and “making over 3,000 technical changes in the law.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reorganized the tax code into seven subtitles, including for income taxes, estate and gift taxes, employment taxes, and two subtitles for excise taxes. The law also reduced some tax rates. The lowest individual income tax rate fell from 22.2% to 20%. The highest rate fell from 92% to 91%. The top corporate tax rate was extended at 52% through March 1955 and was set to fall to 47% thereafter, although the 52% was subsequently extended through 1963.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 would decrease revenue by $0.2 billion over the full year after enactment.

Revenue Act of 1964 (“Kennedy Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Continuing to seek relief from the high tax rates of the 1940s and 1950s, Congress prioritized lowering taxes. The law inspired plenty of debate in Congress around “the wisdom of reducing taxes in a period of prosperity when the government was already running a sizeable deficit.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced the top individual tax rate from 91% to 70%, and the bottom rate from 20% to 14%. The law also reduced the top corporate tax rate from 52% to 48%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1964 would decrease revenue by $11.5 billion over the full year.

Medicare and Medicaid Act of 1965

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As part of President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty,” Congress created Medicare and Medicaid. These mandatory entitlement programs altered the tax code and contributed to the elevated status of payroll taxes as the second-largest revenue generator after income taxes.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law implemented a new federal payroll tax to finance the cost of Medicare, at a 0.70% rate (0.35% each for employees and employers) in 1966. Congress set the rate to increase in subsequent years, and then accelerated those rate increases in future years.

Budgetary Projection: Estimates for what the 1965 law’s payroll tax increases would have raised are difficult to come by, but Medicare costs quickly outstripped early projections. In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee projected that annual Medicare expenditures would be $238 million; instead, Medicare cost $4.6 billion in 1967, its first full year.

Tax Reform Act of 1969

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: President Richard Nixon had asked Congress for a new set of tax reductions earlier that year, but the Tax Reform Act of 1969 was the product of years of discussions between Congress and the Treasury Department (across several administrations) to reform the nation’s tax code.

Notable Tax Provisions: This law introduced new distinctions between single and married filers and differential rates. It also introduced a low-income allowance, functionally raising the minimum standard deduction for taxpayers to $1,000 (at this time, the standard deduction was a percentage of income rather than a fixed dollar amount). The law also set the maximum standard deduction to increase to $2,000 by 1973, and increased the charitable deduction amount to 50% of a person’s contributable base in that year. On the revenue-raising side, the 1969 law increased capital gains taxes, repealed the investment tax credit, and created a minimum tax for individuals.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Tax Reform Act of 1969would increase revenue by $6.2 billion over a two-year period.

The Stagflation Era: 1970-1983

The 1970s saw the end of the Vietnam War and the start of stagflation in which high inflation and weak growth gripped the U.S. economy. Tax policy sought to spur the economy and minimize the effects of persistent inflation. America experienced several recessions from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, in part due to the Fed’s aggressive efforts to curb inflation.

Revenue Act of 1971

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Beginning in the early 1970s, the U.S. economy began to slow. Concerned by the growing economic pressures on Americans, Congress sought ways to lower tax burdens.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased the personal exemption from $650 to $675 in 1971 (and to $750 in subsequent years), and the minimum standard deduction from $1,000 to $1,300. The law also provided a 7% tax credit for businesses investing in expansions to their facilities and equipment, and repealed a 7% excise tax on passenger vehicles.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1971 would decrease revenue by $11.3 billion over a two-year period.

Tax Reduction Act of 1975

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Amid high inflation and a sagging economy, President Gerald Ford and members of Congress expressed interest in stimulating the economy and adjusting several parts of the tax code for inflation. Lawmakers also wanted to address a sense of unfairness in the code due to the regressive nature of tax deductions, which provided a larger benefit to high-income taxpayers than to lower-income ones, by shifting policy from providing deductions to providing credits.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law provided refunds to those filers who had a tax liability in 1974, up to $200 for taxpayers making under $30,000. It also increased the low-income allowance, provided a $30 tax credit per person (including dependents), and created the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The law increased the investment tax credit from 7% to 10% for two years (1975-1976), with a scheduled decline back to 7% from 1977 onwards. It also reduced the rate of the corporate surtax and amount of income subject to the tax for 1975 only, and the lowest corporate tax rate from 22% to 20%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 would decrease revenue by $9.4 billion over a two-year period.

Tax Reform Act of 1976

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The 1973 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo placed economic strain on American households that lingered for years after the resumption of normal trade relations. Congress also had a general interest in simplifying an increasingly complicated tax code, improving tax administration, and improving equity in the tax system without negatively impacting economic growth.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased alternative minimum taxes for individuals and corporations, with the individual minimum tax rate rising from 10% to 15%. The law also extended the holding period for long-term capital gains and phased in an increase for maximum capital loss deductions from $1,000 to $3,000. It expanded tax advantages for individual retirement accounts (IRAs); converted the child care deduction into a child care credit; increased the minimum standard deduction from $1,300 to $1,700 ($2,100 for joint returns) and the maximum deduction from $2,000 to $2,400 ($2,800 for joint returns); extended the EITC that was enacted in the year prior; provided estate tax relief; and extended the investment credit.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Reform Act of 1976 would decrease revenue by $50 billion over five years (FY1977-1981).

Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: President Jimmy Carter had campaigned in 1976 on simplifying the tax code and stimulating a sagging economy. Congress and the president negotiated in the early months of 1977 on a tax law to fulfill those promises.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law changed the standard deduction from 16% of income to a flat $2,200 for single filers ($3,200 for joint), referred to as the “zero bracket amount.” It revised and simplified tax tables for filers. The law also extended the EITC for families with children through 1978. Finally, it extended through 1978 the corporate tax rate cuts for lower-income brackets that began in 1975 and created a new jobs credit for employers.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977 would decrease revenue by $34 billion over three years (FY1977-1979).

Revenue Act of 1978

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As stagflation continued to plague the U.S. economy, Congress sought to further cut taxes to minimize the economic burden on households and businesses and boost the economy.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased the amount of income exempt from taxes in the “zero bracket,” which temporarily replaced the standard deduction, and increased personal exemptions from $750 to $1,000. The zero bracket rose for both single and married filers ($2,220 to $2,300 and $3,200 to $3,400, respectively). The law also lowered the top corporate income tax rate from 48% to 46%, reformed the alternative minimum tax, expanded and made permanent the EITC, and made permanent a 10% investment tax credit.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Revenue Act of 1978 would decrease revenue by $117 billion over five years (FY1979-1983).

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 ( “Reagan Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The United States was in a recession in 1981, triggered in part by Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes to combat high inflation. Congress lowered tax burdens to stimulate economic activity, a top priority of the newly elected President Ronald Reagan.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law cut tax rates across the board, including the top individual rate from 70% to 50%. The law also indexed tax brackets and the personal exemption to inflation for the first time and created a deduction for married couples filing jointly. Allowable IRA contributions were increased from a maximum of $1,500 to $2,000. Congress also introduced the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), which changed the depreciation schedule for business investments. And the law reduced estate tax rates and increased the credit against estate taxes.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act would decrease revenue by $482 billion over five years (FY1981-1985).

Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: The 1981 tax cuts contributed to a spike in deficits and spurred concern about the long-term sustainability of the law. Seeking to reverse or moderate the largest tax cuts, the 1982 law rolled back a number of reforms from 1981.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law pulled back on some of the 1981 accelerations in business deductions and put new limits on claiming the investment tax credit. The law also increased tax withholding on certain dividends and interest; required employers of tipped workers to report receipts and tips to the IRS; included new tax enforcement measures; and increased airport, cigarette, and telephone excise taxes.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 would increase revenue by $215 billion over five years (FY1983-1987).

Social Security Amendments of 1983

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Warnings that Social Security insolvency was imminent triggered congressional bipartisan action to extend the program’s solvency. The recessions of the early 1980s likely contributed to the accelerated depletion of the trust fund. This was due to rapidly rising unemployment, which peaked at 10.8% by the end of 1982.

Notable Tax Provisions: Federal government and nonprofit workers hired after 1984 became eligible for Social Security. The law thus broadened the payroll tax base to these workers. More broadly, the law increased payroll tax rates from 5.4% on Social Security taxes and 1.3% on Medicare taxes (each paid by employee and employer) to 6.2% and 1.45%, respectively, by 1990. The law also taxed Social Security benefits for high-income beneficiaries for the first time. Congress has changed payroll tax rates and rules several times since World War II. In this overview of major tax laws, BPC generally only covers the 1965 law that created Medicare and Medicaid and the 1983 law that extended Social Security solvency.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Social Security Amendments of 1983 would increase revenue by $57 billion over a five-year period.

The Reform Era: 1984-2000

Over the next 15 years, Congress focused on simplifying the tax code, broadening the tax base, and eventually balancing the budget. Three of the four major tax bills were bipartisan, and some were wrapped into broader budget negotiations.

Tax Reform Act of 1986

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) was the second of President Reagan’s major tax reform efforts. The 1986 law sought to revamp the entire tax code, driven primarily by a desire for simplification. Today’s tax code still reflects many of the reforms from 1986, and TRA still stands out as one of U.S. history’s most bipartisan, comprehensive federal tax reform laws.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced the top individual tax rate from 50% to 28%, and it collapsed more than a dozen tax brackets into just two—15% and 28%. The law also eliminated the preferential tax treatment of capital gains, taxing gains at a top 28% rate as well. The law phased out the ability to deduct several kinds of personal interest expenses, other than mortgage interest. The law also cut the top corporate tax rate from 46% to 34%, but overall it increased corporate tax liabilities by repealing the investment tax credit, changing corporate deduction rules, and expanding the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 1986 Tax Reform Act would decrease revenue by $300 million over five years (FY1987-1991).

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: President George H.W. Bush and Democrats in Congress—who controlled the House and the Senate—negotiated for months over a bipartisan budget agreement that would reduce deficits. The final package cut mandatory spending, increased taxes, and placed caps on discretionary spending.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased individual income taxes by raising rates (including the top rate from 28% to 31%), phasing out personal exemptions, and limiting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. The law also increased and/or extended several excise taxes, including on gas, alcohol, aviation, telecommunications, and tobacco. It also increased the amount of wages subject to Medicare payroll taxes.

Budgetary Projection: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and JCT projected that OBRA 1990 would increase revenue by $158 billion over five years (FY1991-1995).

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: A newly elected President Bill Clinton and Democrats in Congress—who controlled both the House and the Senate, although they did not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate—negotiated for months on a budget deal to reduce deficits in the years ahead. CBO ultimately projected that the deal would reduce deficits by $433 billion over five years, with a roughly even mix of tax increases and spending cuts.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law added a 36% individual income tax bracket and a surtax on income above $250,000, bringing the top rate from 31% to 39.6%. The 1993 OBRA also increased gas taxes, the amount of wages subject to Medicare payroll taxes, and the top corporate tax rate from 34% to 35%.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that OBRA 1993 would increase revenue by $241 billion over five years (FY1994-1998).

Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: The Taxpayer Relief Act was one of two bills signed into law by President Clinton that together enacted a bipartisan budget agreement between the Democratic president and the Republican-controlled Congress. After months of negotiations, policymakers agreed on a package that reduced spending but also cut taxes.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law created the Child Tax Credit (CTC), allowing families to receive a credit of up to $500 per child. It also created tax credits for higher-education expenses, a deduction for student loan interest (up to $2,500 per year from 2001 onwards), and Roth IRA accounts that allowed people to contribute to tax-advantaged retirement accounts with after-tax dollars. The law reduced capital gains taxes (the maximum rate decreased from 28% to 20%) and increased the credit against estate taxes.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 would decrease revenue by $68 billion over five years (FY1997-2001).

The Tax Cut Era: 2001-Present

At the turn of the century, the combination of a strong economy and bipartisan action to reduce deficits created the first budget surpluses in decades. Those surpluses would not last. Both parties have passed major tax cuts in the 21st century, albeit Republicans have done so more often than Democrats. These tax cuts have contributed to a decline in revenue as a share of GDP over the 21st century.

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (“2001 Bush Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: President George W. Bush had campaigned in 2000 on tax reform, and Republican policymakers advocated using the federal government’s newfound surpluses to finance tax cuts. Although Congress used reconciliation to pass the 2001 tax law to avoid the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster, several Democrats in both chambers of Congress joined nearly all Republicans in supporting the bill.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law created a 10% individual income tax bracket (the previous lowest bracket was 15%); reduced individual income tax rates across the board; provided $300 stimulus payments; increased the CTC from $500 per child to $1,000 per child over several years; reduced marriage penalties in the tax code; phased down and scheduled a repeal of the estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) taxes; and increased contribution limits for tax-advantaged retirement accounts.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2001 Bush tax cuts would decrease revenue by $1.2 trillion over 10 years (FY2001-2010).

Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (“2003 Bush Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: President Bush and congressional Republicans pursued a second major round of tax cuts to spur economic growth amid a slow economic recovery from the 2001 recession.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends; accelerated individual income tax rate reductions; accelerated the increase in the CTC to $1,000 per child; and provided additional relief from the AMT.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2003 Bush tax cuts would decrease revenue by $351 billion over 10 years (FY2003-2012).

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: After the 2009 stimulus package in the wake of the Great Recession, President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats made expanding health insurance coverage and reducing health care costs a top priority. Their efforts culminated in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Notable Tax Provisions: Although the bulk of the law was focused on health spending provisions, it included several changes to the nation’s tax code. The ACA created premium tax credits to subsidize the purchase of health insurance on new state-based exchanges. To help pay for the premium tax credits and Medicaid expansions in the law, the ACA created several new taxes and fees, including the net investment income tax (NIIT); the Additional Medicare Tax; the Cadillac tax; individual and employer penalties for failure to obtain or provide health insurance; the medical device tax; and fees on brand drugs and insurers. Congress later repealed the Cadillac tax, medical device tax, and insurers fee.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the ACA would increase revenue by $525 billion over 10 years (FY2010-2019).

Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Congress and President Obama faced a December 31, 2010, expiration of trillions of dollars in 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts. After the midterm elections in which Republicans regained the House, policymakers settled on a temporary extension of the expiring Bush tax cuts through the end of 2012.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law extended the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts through 2012, reinstated the estate tax after a one-year repeal, and extended more-generous business expensing allowances through 2012. It also introduced a temporary 2-percentage-point payroll tax cut for 2011 that was a key ask of the Obama administration as it sought to stimulate the economic recovery from the Great Recession.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2010 tax law would decrease revenue by $858 billion over 10 years (FY2011-2020).

American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) of 2012

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: After the bipartisan 2010 tax law extended the expiring Bush tax cuts for two years, Congress faced another tax cliff on December 31, 2012. Weeks of negotiations between the Republican-led House, Democratic-led Senate, and President Obama produced a bipartisan deal that made permanent the majority of the expiring 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent, including lower individual income tax rates, lower capital gains tax rates, AMT relief, a larger CTC (then $1,000 per child), and an expanded EITC. The law raised the top individual income tax rate from 35% to 39.6% and the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. It also extended dozens of individual, business, and energy tax provisions through 2013.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that ATRA would decrease revenue by $3.9 trillion over 10 years (FY2013-2022).

2015 Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Dozens of tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, with more expirations scheduled for the end of 2016 and 2017. Both parties in Congress and President Obama sought to address several of these expiring policies once and for all through permanent extensions, rather than treating them as “extenders” to be revisited every few years.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law permanently extended a more generous CTC, the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for higher-education expenses, the state and local sales tax deduction, the R&D credit, Section 179 expensing for small businesses, and exceptions to taxes on foreign income, among dozens of other provisions. Congress extended many additional provisions for a shorter period, through 2016 or 2019.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the PATH Act would decrease revenue by $622 billion over 10 years (FY2016-2025).

2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: During the 2016 campaign, several Republican presidential candidates and policymakers expressed an interest in comprehensive tax reform. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans turned their attention in summer 2017 to the law that became TCJA.

Notable Tax Provisions: TCJA significantly overhauled both the individual and business sides of the tax code. The law lowered individual income tax rates across the board; suspended personal exemptions; doubled the standard deduction; limited itemized deductions like the state and local tax (SALT) deduction; doubled the CTC; and provided relief from the AMT and estate tax. TCJA also lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (and eliminated the graduated corporate income tax schedule, leaving just one 21% rate); created a 20% deduction for pass-through business income; enacted a temporary expensing allowance for business machinery and equipment; and overhauled the tax treatment of U.S. multinational companies’ income earned abroad.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that TCJA would decrease revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years (FY2018-2027).

2020 COVID Relief Legislation

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented economic and social disruptions. Congress and President Trump enacted four laws on a bipartisan basis in 2020 to address those disruptions and provide tax relief, the largest of which was the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Notable Tax Provisions: The CARES Act included $1,200 stimulus checks to tens of millions of Americans, delivered as refundable, advanceable tax credits through the IRS. The CARES Act also created the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) for businesses that kept employees on payroll during the pandemic and provided businesses with increased flexibility to carry back tax losses. The CARES Act was followed by a December 2020 COVID relief law that provided an additional $600 stimulus check to tens of millions of Americans.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the 2020 COVID relief laws would decrease revenue by $809 billion over 10 years.

American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats were motivated in early 2021 to pass additional tax relief and stimulus to address the ongoing economic and public health effects of the COVID pandemic.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law included $1,400 stimulus checks to tens of millions of Americans, delivered once again through the IRS. The law also expanded the CTC from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child (and $3,600 for children under six) for 2021 only, expanded the EITC for childless workers for 2021 only, and expanded ACA subsidies for 2021 and 2022.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that ARPA would decrease revenue by $590 billion over 10 years (FY2021-2030).

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: After ARPA’s passage, President Biden and congressional Democrats turned their attention to major domestic tax-and-spending legislation. Failure in the Senate to pass the Build Back Better (BBB) agenda led to deliberations over what became the Inflation Reduction Act in summer 2022.

Notable Tax Provisions: The legislation included hundreds of billions of dollars in new or expanded tax incentives for clean energy, from electric vehicles to wind and solar projects to advanced manufacturing projects. The law also extended expiring ACA tax subsidies through 2025, restored a corporate AMT (previously repealed by TCJA), created a stock buyback tax, and appropriated $80 billion to the IRS for enhanced enforcement and modernization efforts. (The clean energy incentives and IRS funding have since been rolled back.)

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Inflation Reduction Act would increase revenue by $91 billion over 10 years (FY2022-2031).

One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) of 2025

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: The top priority of President Trump and congressional Republicans in 2025 was extending the expiring individual tax cuts from the 2017 TCJA. President Trump also sought to enact several new tax cuts he had promised on the campaign trail, such as “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law permanently extended the vast majority of expiring TCJA tax cuts, including lower individual income tax rates, a doubled standard deduction and CTC, and relief from the AMT and estate tax. It included several temporary tax cuts aimed at President Trump’s campaign promises, including a tips income deduction, an overtime pay deduction, a manufacturing expensing allowance, and a larger senior deduction—all scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. The law cut business taxes significantly, extending TCJA’s pass-through deduction, making bonus depreciation for machinery and equipment permanent, and restoring full expensing for business R&D. OBBB also rolled back most of the clean energy tax incentives enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, mostly by ending them early.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that OBBB would decrease revenue by $4.5 trillion over 10 years (FY2025-2034).

Overall Trends: 1945-Present

Research Notes

For determining whether a law was partisan or bipartisan, we rely on roll call vote data from GovTrack and from Congress.gov. For determining the budgetary effects of major tax laws, we use one methodology for laws from 1945-1975 and a different methodology for laws from 1976-2025. For the earlier years, we rely on a 2006 Treasury Department paper that succinctly summarizes the revenue effects of major tax laws in current dollars. JCT (formerly called JCIRT) used a variety of budget windows during that time period; first one year, then two, then three, and so on. For the later years, we generally rely on scores available from JCT’s website (and, in some cases, supplemented by CBO reports). We use five-year effects from 1981-2000, and 10-year effects from 2001-present",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tax-Reform-Papers.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:03:43.261273

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule The original TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule established a one-time, nationwide reporting obligation for any company that manufactured or imported PFAS — including PFAS contained in articles — at any time from 2011 through 2022.
The EPA estimates this significant change will eliminate approximately 80% of the total cost of compliance with the PFAS reporting rule, saving small businesses more than $700M.
These adjustments would further align the PFAS reporting rule with the Chemical Data Reporting framework under TSCA.
As long as the rule is finalized by Aug. 1, 2026, the required PFAS reporting information, for all 12 reporting years, will be due to EPA in calendar year 2026.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed amendments to simplify its Toxic Substances Control Act Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting and Recordkeeping Rule, first released in 2023. Compliance deadlines have been postponed several times.

The proposed rule, announced in November, would narrow the rule’s scope and reduce compliance burdens by exempting certain categories not likely to produce high value information for the EPA, while maintaining many of the core reporting requirements for PFAS manufactured or imported between 2011 and 2022.

Under the proposed rule, the EPA would offer two key exemptions (among others) and adjust the submission period to reflect the narrowed obligations.

The reporting window would now open 60 days after the final rule’s effective date and remain open for three months, meaning regulated entities should anticipate a condensed reporting timeline in 2026.

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule

The original TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule established a one-time, nationwide reporting obligation for any company that manufactured or imported PFAS — including PFAS contained in articles — at any time from 2011 through 2022.

It required detailed, compound-by-compound submissions covering each year in that period, including data on chemical identity, categories of use, production volumes, byproducts, environmental and health effects, worker exposure and disposal practices.

The rule applied broadly, even to entities that had never before filed under TSCA, and did not include exemptions for de minimis, imported-articles, or other customary TSCA chemical data, making compliance particularly challenging for manufacturers and importers with complex or global supply chains.

The EPA’s intent was to build a comprehensive database of PFAS presence and use across U.S. commerce to inform future regulatory and risk-management actions.

Key Proposed Exemptions

1. De Minimis Exemption (0.1%)

The EPA proposes to exempt from reporting all PFAS present at concentrations below 0.1% in mixtures or articles.

The EPA cited both legal precedent and practical considerations, noting that such trace-level information is generally unknown or not reasonably ascertainable for manufacturers and importers based on historical recordkeeping and labeling standards.

The 0.1% threshold aligns with long-standing Safety Data Sheet notification levels and recognizes that many PFAS used at low levels were never disclosed by suppliers during the 2011–2022 lookback period.

The exemption is intended to eliminate disproportionate compliance efforts to locate information of minimal regulatory or environmental value, while still capturing reportable PFAS above that concentration.

This will allow most manufacturers and importers to reasonably rely on their supplier SDSs as the justification for reporting (or not reporting) under the rule.

2. Imported Articles Exemption

The EPA also proposes to exclude PFAS imported as part of a finished article from the rule’s scope.

EPA found that importers of finished goods are least likely to have direct knowledge of PFAS content in those products and that Congress, in drafting TSCA Section 8(a)(7), intended reporting to apply to manufacturers of PFAS themselves, not to importers of products merely containing PFAS.

The EPA reasoned that this exemption will still preserve meaningful data through reporting by the original PFAS manufacturers, who remain responsible for identifying downstream uses of their PFAS in articles.

The EPA estimates this significant change will eliminate approximately 80% of the total cost of compliance with the PFAS reporting rule, saving small businesses more than $700M.

Other Clarifications

Although affecting a much smaller subset of industry, additional proposed exemptions include PFAS manufactured as byproducts or impurities, or used as non-isolated intermediates within a closed system and PFAS manufactured or imported in small quantities solely for research and development purposes.

These adjustments would further align the PFAS reporting rule with the Chemical Data Reporting framework under TSCA.

Practical Implications

While the proposed changes provide significant relief, especially for importers of finished goods/articles and small manufacturers, companies should not interpret the revisions as removing all PFAS-related reporting obligations under TSCA.

The rule remains broad in coverage for entities that directly manufacture or import PFAS compounds or mixtures containing them above the de minimis threshold and it will be important to continue internal compliance efforts.

Importantly, the reporting window will likely be shorter and the expected start date in 2026 means affected companies should begin re-scoping (hopefully in progress) compliance efforts in 2025 to align with the revised submission requirements.

Next Steps

The EPA’s proposed revisions are open for public comment until Dec. 29, 2025.

Sixty days after the rule is finalized, the submission period of regulatorily required reporting information (on a yet to be published online form) will open and run for three months.

As long as the rule is finalized by Aug. 1, 2026, the required PFAS reporting information, for all 12 reporting years, will be due to EPA in calendar year 2026.

Takeaways

The proposal is a shift to a narrower and more manageable PFAS reporting framework, emphasizing data from entities most likely to have meaningful information.

The de minimis and imported-articles exemptions are expected to simplify compliance while preserving the EPA’s ability to collect the most critical PFAS manufacturing data.

Manufacturers and importers should continue efforts to ensure compliance, as the EPA has recognized industry has been aware of this rule since 2023 and expects companies will need less time to prepare reports based on work to date.

The plant, located in Chile’s Ñuble region, will convert biogas into liquid biomethane, which Lipigas will distribute to transport companies and industries across the country as part of Chile’s move toward cleaner energy, reports Bioenergy Insight.

The new plant uses a modular, container-based “plug and play” system made up of six interconnected units. Three of the units handle biogas treatment processes — including cleaning and liquefaction — while the remaining three manage essential services such as water and dry air supply. This design enabled faster installation and commissioning.

The site will form part of a Southeast Asian power grid initiative and further connect to Singapore to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.

While the final scope hasn’t been announced, the initial sizing of the scheme is for a 2,000 square kilometre hybrid solar and battery energy storage system zone, with some 10,000 acres set for the initial phase of the project. This initial phase was said to be “expected” to include up to 4 GWp of solar capacity and 5.12 GWh of energy storage capacity.

The ‘Cooperation Document’ exchanged by key parties, including the Johor state, also brought together many initiatives. One is a pan-Southeast Asian grid initiative, dubbed the ASEAN Power Grid or APG, that aims to connect Malaysia’s Johor region with Singapore as part of a Johor–Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) masterplan and facilitate cross-border electricity trade.

It is also part of the Johor Renewable Energy Policy 2030, which details in an outline joint efforts across project development, technical support, and further potential financing for the project, and ties into the stated ambitions of the Johor Green Development Policy 2030.

There are some surprises in the details of the players involved.

Other investors, alongside the World Bank’s private sector arm known as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), included the strategic investment arm of the Johor State Permodalan Darul Ta’zim (PDT), and Ditrolic Energy, an independent clean energy company in Southeast Asia, headquartered in Malaysia. No funding splits or details were announced at a ceremony attended by officials and dignitaries, including the Queen of Malaysia, Raja Zarith Sofiah.

While likely to offer attractive renewable energy for the city-state of Singapore, the announcement also detailed that Johor is aiming to attract both manufacturing and hyperscale data center operators. Some 125,000 jobs were said to be created through the lifecycle of the project.

One of the surprise players is Ditrolic Energy, which according to ESS News information, has only 300 MW of active projects built, making this project dwarf its other engagements.

What they said:

Dato’ Ramlee bin A Rahman, President and Group Chief Executive of PDT: “As the state agency entrusted to formulate the Johor Green Development Policy 2030, PDT is proud to witness our strategic framework transition into tangible reality today. “The Southern Johor Renewable Energy Corridor (SJREC) was conceived as the cornerstone of this policy, specifically Strategy 1, to unlock the immense solar potential of the Kota Tinggi and Mersing districts.

“By partnering with global leaders like IFC and Ditrolic Energy, we are operationalizing the SJREC not only to power the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), but to actively facilitate cross-border energy trading. This project confirms Johor’s readiness to serve as a primary renewable energy hub for the ASEAN Power Grid, realizing the vision we set forth for a sustainable, high-growth future. The project is expected to generate significant economic benefits for the region by creating an estimated 125,000 jobs through the construction, operations, and maintenance of renewable-energy infrastructure, enabling industrial expansion, and attracting high-quality, foreign-direct investment.”

Judith Green, World Bank Group Country Manager for Malaysia: “We are delighted to partner with Permodalan Darul Ta’zim and Ditrolic Energy on this innovative project. Not only will this project support the broader sustainable development ambitions of Johor, it will also create jobs, potentially attract foreign direct investment, while facilitating cross-border clean energy trade between two key ASEAN economies, bolstering the broader ASEAN Power Grid initiative.”

Tham Chee Aun, Chief Executive Officer of Ditrolic Energy: “We are proud to partner with the Johor State Government and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector, IFC, in this historic initiative. As a Johor-born company that has expanded across Asia and become one of Malaysia’s largest developers, Ditrolic is deeply committed to contributing back to our home state. Our 4GWp solar-plus-storage catalytic development within the SJREC will anchor Johor’s clean energy export potential and provide a foundation for industries seeking renewable, low-cost power in the region.”

Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.
FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance.
“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall.
Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.","Extreme weather is making the grid more prone to outages — and now FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities want more leeway on their reliability requirements.

Put simply, FirstEnergy is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to let Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Ohio Edison, and Toledo Edison take longer to restore power when the lights go out. The latter two utilities would also be allowed slightly more frequent outages per customer each year.

Comments regarding the request are due to the utilities commission on Dec. 8, less than three weeks after regulators approved higher electricity rates for hundreds of thousands of northeast Ohio utility customers. An administrative trial, known as an evidentiary hearing, is currently set to start Jan. 21.

Consumer and environmental advocates say it’s unfair to make customers shoulder the burden of lower-quality service, as they have already been paying for substantial grid-hardening upgrades.

“Relaxing reliability standards can jeopardize the health and safety of Ohio consumers,” said Maureen Willis, head of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which is the state’s legal representative for utility customers. ​“It also shifts the costs of more frequent and longer outages onto Ohioans who already paid millions of dollars to utilities to enhance and develop their distribution systems.”

The United States has seen a rise in blackouts linked to severe weather, a 2024 analysis by Climate Central found, with about twice as many such events happening from 2014 through 2023 compared to the 10 years from 2000 through 2009.

The duration of the longest blackouts has also grown. As of mid-2025, the average length of 12.8 hours represents a jump of almost 60% from 2022, J.D. Power reported in October.

Ohio regulators have approved less stringent reliability standards before, notably for AES Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio, where obligations from those or other orders required investments and other actions to improve reliability.

Some utilities elsewhere in the country have also sought leeway on reliability expectations. In April, for example, two New York utilities asked to exclude some outages related to tree disease and other factors from their performance metrics, which would in effect relax their standards.

Other utilities haven’t necessarily pursued lower targets, but have nonetheless noted vulnerabilities to climate change or experienced more major events that don’t count toward requirements.

FirstEnergy’s case is particularly notable because the company has slow-rolled clean energy and energy efficiency, two tools that advocates say can cost-effectively bolster grid reliability and guard against weather-related outages.

There is also a certain irony to the request: FirstEnergy’s embrace of fossil fuels at the expense of clean energy and efficiency measures has let its subsidiaries’ operations and others continue to emit high levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.

FirstEnergy filed its application to the Public Utilities Commission last December, while its recently decided rate case and other cases linked to its House Bill 6 corruption scandal were pending. FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance. From there, FirstEnergy says the state should tack on extra allowances for longer or more frequent outages to ​“account for annual variability in factors outside the Companies’ control, in particular, weather impacts that can vary significantly on a year-to-year basis.”

“Honestly, I don’t know of a viable hypothesis for this increasing variability outside of climate change,” said Victoria Petryshyn, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Southern California, who grew up in Ohio.

In summer, systems are burdened by constant air conditioning use during periods of extreme heat and humidity. In winter, frigid air masses resulting from disruptions to the jet stream can boost demand for heat and ​“cause extra strain on the grid if natural-gas lines freeze,” Petryshyn said.

“All the weather becomes supercharged,” Petryshyn said. ​“We can all expect stronger storms, stronger winds, and more frequent extreme weather that threatens grid stability.”

Contributing to the problem?

FirstEnergy has a long history of obstructing measures that would both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate stress on the power grid.

In February 2024, the company abandoned its interim 2030 goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and said it would continue running two West Virginia coal plants. Before that, FirstEnergy backed plans to weaken Ohio’s energy-efficiency goals. And during the first Trump administration, the company urged the Department of Energy to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal and nuclear plants running.

FirstEnergy also spent roughly $60 million on efforts to get lawmakers to pass and protect House Bill 6, the law at the heart of Ohio’s largest utility corruption scandal. HB 6’s nuclear and coal bailouts have since been repealed, but the state’s clean-energy standards remain gutted.

Meanwhile, regulators have let FirstEnergy’s utilities charge customers millions of dollars for grid modernization, ​“which are supposed to support the utility’s ability to adapt and improve the electric grid to rigging challenges from climate change,” said Karin Nordstrom, a clean-energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council.

“However, FirstEnergy has not provided the same investment in energy-efficiency programs, which can help manage rising demand at lower cost than expensive capital investment,” Nordstrom said. FirstEnergy should fully exhaust those tools and customer-funded grid-modernization investments before regulators relax the company’s requirements, she added.

Limited transparency makes FirstEnergy’s plan even more problematic, according to Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Earlier this year, Banton reported on grid disparities in FirstEnergy’s service territories that leave some areas more prone to outages.

“It feels too early for them to request leniency without proposing or implementing more comprehensive mitigations based on a detailed understanding of the root cause,” Banton said.

It’s also likely that FirstEnergy’s rate increase of nearly $76 million for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.’s roughly 745,000 customers, approved on Nov. 19, already accounts for some weather-related factors. This summer, spokesperson Hannah Catlett told Canary Media that ​“the Illuminating Co. service territory generally sees bigger storm impacts” than areas served by FirstEnergy’s other Ohio utilities.

“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall. ​“We are confident in the progress underway and remain focused on improving reliability through continued investment in the communities we are privileged to serve.”

But fundamentally, additional leeway for weather variation is unnecessary, said Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and former executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/51155404126_79c5193be4_c.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0cf0feeab3f5538062084b4e3769bb6d,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:54.040564

Tackling the toughest challenges CNCA cities are also pioneering work in policy areas that have traditionally received less attention, but offer huge opportunities.
In most cities, buildings represent the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet cities have struggled to address the pollution generated throughout buildings’ entire lifecycles.","In Stockholm, city planners are reimagining how buildings can absorb carbon instead of releasing it into the air. In Melbourne, community advocates are working alongside city officials to ensure clean energy reaches neighborhoods that have historically been left behind. In Amsterdam, discarded solar panels are finding new life, preventing waste while expanding renewable energy access to those who need it most.

These aren’t isolated success stories — they’re part of a growing movement of cities around the world refusing to accept incremental change at a time when our communities need transformational action to thrive.

More than half the world’s population now lives in cities, and these urban centers account for approximately 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, cities hold tremendous power to slow climate change by shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy and eliminating those greenhouse gas emissions. While many cities have adopted climate action plans, most haven’t set goals big enough to fully remove all carbon pollution from city systems like transportation and buildings.

But a trailblazing group of cities is charting a different course. The Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (CNCA) brings together leading cities worldwide committed to achieving carbon neutrality within 10 to 20 years, among the most ambitious targets undertaken by any city globally.

Created in 2015 with support from Kresge, CNCA enables these pioneering cities to advance their transformational efforts, collaborate to overcome barriers, foster innovative approaches and share lessons with others pursuing similar goals.

“The Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance connects U.S. cities with international knowledge and resource hubs, and creates opportunities to learn from and workshop with peers and partners across regions,” said Kresge Environment Senior Program Officer Jessica Boehland.

Moving beyond technology to systems change

What sets this work apart is CNCA’s fundamental approach. Rather than focusing solely on technology and emissions reduction, CNCA champions a systems-based framework that addresses the root causes of climate change while putting people and nature at the center of climate solutions.

The alliance’s shared purpose is clear: mobilize transformative climate action to achieve prosperity, equity, resilience and better quality of life for all on a thriving planet.

“We believe that by supporting cities in developing and implementing game-changing climate policies, we will accelerate transformative climate action and generate replicable models for cities worldwide,” says Simone Mangili, executive director of CNCA. “This isn’t just about reducing carbon — it’s about reimagining how cities function, who benefits from climate action and stewarding natural systems for generations to come.”

Putting bold ideas into action

Through its Game Changer Fund, CNCA has already invested more than $5 million in 76 city-led projects since 2015, leveraging an additional $46 million in continued support. These aren’t conventional projects that fit neatly into traditional public funding streams. They’re bold experiments tackling high-impact challenges at the intersection of climate change and equity.

Recent investments show this approach in action. Amsterdam’s project creates a system to reuse old solar panels instead of throwing them away. Melbourne is developing a community-driven plan to fight energy poverty grounded in data.

In the U.S., New York City and Washington DC joined with Copenhagen to explore equitable models for congestion pricing, which reduces traffic in certain areas of the city, improving air quality while providing revenue to support public transit and bicycling and walking paths. These projects don’t just reduce pollution — they make communities stronger and help local people create sustainable solutions.

Justice at the center

CNCA is also helping cities move toward genuine power-sharing in climate policy development. Through its Climate Justice Grant Program, community organizations now lead proposals in partnership with cities, shifting who shapes climate solutions.

The alliance facilitates learning cohorts where cities in the U.S. and around the world share strategies for building relationships with communities and designing context-specific policies. The goal is to create climate policies and programs that maximize benefits and mitigate burdens for communities that have historically borne the greatest impacts of environmental injustice.

“This represents a fundamental reimagining of how climate action happens — not to communities, but with them,” said CNCA’s Director of Climate Justice Tracy Morgenstern.

Tackling the toughest challenges

CNCA cities are also pioneering work in policy areas that have traditionally received less attention, but offer huge opportunities. In most cities, buildings represent the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet cities have struggled to address the pollution generated throughout buildings’ entire lifecycles.

CNCA now supports 15 European cities in identifying and implementing local policies to reduce carbon pollution embedded in buildings while ensuring these policies address housing, jobs and social inclusion.

The alliance also recently hosted a climate justice workshop where teams from five North American cities – Boston, Portland, Seattle, Toronto and Boulder, Colorado – and partners from community-based organizations joined their European counterparts to explore strategies and tools for improving buildings and infrastructure to benefit people’s lives and the economy. A new resource titled Embodying Justice in the Built Environment: Just and Equitable Land Use Transitions reflects some of the challenges and opportunities cities are facing on their journeys.

In addition, CNCA also plans to host a climate justice workshop for five teams of city staff and community partners from cities in the Midwest to support participatory and whole-of-government approaches to climate action planning.

Similarly, the alliance is helping cities tackle consumption-based emissions, transition towards more circular economies that reduce resource extraction and develop initiatives that pull carbon from the air and improve quality of life while regenerating natural systems. These approaches recognize that the same green infrastructure that captures carbon can also cool cities, reduce flooding and improve air quality — delivering multiple benefits to communities.

A network built on peer learning

At its heart, CNCA succeeds because it creates space for staff from cities at the cutting edge of climate action to build relationships and learn from each other. Annual meetings, regional convenings and virtual learning cohorts allow practitioners to share what’s working, troubleshoot challenges and inspire each other to stay the course even when facing political headwinds.

“CNCA’s annual meetings and virtual convenings have become an essential moment for members to commune with one another and inspire each other, deepen collaboration among city agencies and departments and work across city administrations to mainstream climate action,” said long-time CNCA member of CNCA Doug Smith, deputy general manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability at the City of Vancouver.

This peer learning accelerates innovation in ways that top-down approaches cannot. When cities with similarly ambitious goals share experiences, they move faster together than any could alone.

Looking ahead

As national and regional climate commitments waver, cities are proving that transformative action remains possible – and is often pioneered at the local level.

The window for climate action is narrowing rapidly. But in cities from Rio de Janeiro to Yokohama, and from Seattle to Copenhagen, practitioners are demonstrating that we can build a future that is not only carbon neutral but also more beautiful, more just and more livable for all.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/PHOTO-2022-10-12-09-24-56.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:07:11.748224

Clarkson’s project focuses on scaling up a non-thermal plasma spinning-disc reactor that produces plasma-activated water (PAW). PAW contains nitrogen available for immediate uptake through roots and leaves, enabling farms to generate fertilizer on-site. New York farms currently rely on nitrogen fertilizer produced with fossil fuels and transported up to 2,000 miles, contributing to 47 percent of the state’s greenhouse-gas emissions.

“This technology has the potential to transform fertilizer production from a global supply chain into a local, low-emission process,” Selma Mededovic Thagard, the Richard and Helen March Professor in Clarkson’s Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. “It’s about creating practical solutions that support farmers while protecting the environment.”

The Clarkson team will develop a farm-scale reactor prototype, conduct a lifecycle analysis and test PAW effectiveness on New York crops such as tomatoes and lettuce. The work aims to demonstrate that on-farm fertilizer generation can significantly reduce carbon footprints, lower nitrogen runoff and decrease economic vulnerability for rural and smaller farms.

The project, led by Mededovic Thagard and Thomas Holsen, Jean S. Newell Distinguished Professor of Engineering and Co-Director of CAARES, is one of seven statewide initiatives selected for funding through the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute’s (NYSP2I) 2025–26 Research and Development Program. NYSP2I awarded $650,000 this year to support practical, near-term sustainability solutions that help New York businesses reduce their environmental impact while improving economic competitiveness.

Currently, the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff race holds the title of most expensive Senate race, with $472 million spent by the candidates and outside groups.
State politics has also become more nationalized, and as a result, US Senate race outcomes match presidential election results most of the time.
Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer said three battleground Senate races are scheduled in 2026 — in Maine, Georgia and North Carolina.
If the court sides with the political parties, as expected, it would probably extend the amount by which the Senate race in North Carolina breaks spending records, Heberlig said.","The race to replace outgoing US Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, is set to break records. Political strategists anticipate it will be the most expensive US Senate race in history — between $600 million and $800 million will likely be spent, according to Politico. Currently, the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff race holds the title of most expensive Senate race, with $472 million spent by the candidates and outside groups.

Former North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will face the winner of the Republican primary. Michael Whatley, former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and Republican National Committee, secured President Donald Trump’s endorsement against Navy veteran Don Brown in the primary election. Many observers think Whatley is likely to cruise to the general election.

A lack of competitive Senate races nationwide, North Carolina’s history of expensive campaigns and the current political climate all contribute to the level of expected spending, according to political experts who spoke to Carolina Public Press.

Money talks, loudly and often. Voters should anticipate an avalanche of political ads as candidates attempt to convince their supporters to get out and vote, sell their vision to persuadable voters and weaken their opponents.

One of few Senate battlegrounds

The level of anticipated spending on North Carolina’s Senate election starts with a simple math problem: national donors have a lot of money to burn, and very few places to effectively spend it.

Fewer truly competitive Senate races are expected in 2026 would have been the case a few decades ago. Voters have geographically sorted themselves based on their political ideologies. State politics has also become more nationalized, and as a result, US Senate race outcomes match presidential election results most of the time.

Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer said three battleground Senate races are scheduled in 2026 — in Maine, Georgia and North Carolina.

Currently, Democrats effectively hold 47 seats in the US Senate, with the votes of two Independents. Republicans have 53 seats. To stand any chance of gaining a majority, Democrats have to keep Georgia and Michigan, pick up North Carolina and Maine, and upset at least one Republican-leaning contest in Ohio, Iowa or Texas, Bitzer said.

Republicans, on the other hand, need to stand their ground. With so few seats to fight over, much of the national donor money will flow to North Carolina.

A costly precedent has also been set in North Carolina Senate races, said Douglas Wilson, a political consultant who has worked for Hagan, former President Barack Obama, Jeff Jackson and other state Democrats.

In 2014, the race between Tillis, then Speaker of the NC House, and incumbent US Sen. Kay Hagan, D-NC, for a spot in the North Carolina congressional delegation was the most expensive of the cycle, at $121 million in spending.

The next time around, in 2020, groups supporting Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham spent $296 million, enough for third-highest spending. While Tillis won that race easily against the former state senator, the race had been close before a sex scandal undermined Cunningham’s support in the final weeks before the election.

But the 2026 race for an open seat is on another level. Wilson blames that on the current political climate, economic headwinds and the threat of losing Medicaid expansion in North Carolina — “ground zero for health care.”

Campaign finance

Past and future Supreme Court rulings may also contribute to spending levels. In 2010, the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling in Citizens United that effectively opened the floodgates to unlimited outside spending on elections.

The court ruled that corporations had a First Amendment free speech right to spend money as they wished, as long as it didn’t flow directly to candidates. As a result, corporations and outside groups can launch political ads, get out the vote campaigns and more on behalf of favored candidates without financial barriers.

More recently, the Supreme Court heard a case that would loosen restrictions on certain political party spending. If the court sides with the political parties, as expected, it would probably extend the amount by which the Senate race in North Carolina breaks spending records, Heberlig said.

“But the parties already have quite a bit of flexibility,” he added. “It won’t be a revolutionary change.”

These rulings impact who is backing candidates. Campaign finance watchdog and former Democracy North Carolina Executive Director Bob Hall thinks it’s for the worse.

“The whole political process is warped by private money,” he said. “It’s a public election, but unfortunately, private money has an enormous impact, and it’s just the result of Supreme Court decisions that protect the rights of campaign spenders.”

There may be a point of diminishing return; a time when candidates have squeezed as much as they can with their money, and it becomes less effective.

“When you have so many ads, it just becomes noise to the average voter,” Heberlig said. “Practically speaking, what all these groups are doing is just offsetting the spending and advertising of the other side. You don’t want to leave the other side to dominate the air wars, because then people are only going to receive information from one perspective, and therefore are more likely to go with that.”

Early bird gets the worm

As soon as Tillis announced his departure from Congress, all sights were set on Cooper. Among politicos, it wasn’t so much a matter of whether the former governor would run for U.S. Senate, but when he would declare his intention to do so.

He did so early. On July 28, Cooper announced that he would run for office — nearly a year and a half before the 2026 general election, and four months before he could officially file to run in North Carolina.

Three days later, Whatley followed suit.

By the end of September, both had garnered millions of dollars to support their campaigns. According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings, Cooper’s campaign and associated committees raised about $14.5 million, while Whatley’s raised $5.8 million, by the end of September.

Starting early offers an advantage, said Eric Heberlig, UNC-Charlotte political science professor.

“Early spending gives you the ability to define yourself positively and your opponent negatively before people have any other sources of information,” he said. “If you can do that over long periods of time, that means people get more hardened in the information they have and are less persuadable as we get closer to the election.”

Cooper is already well-known in North Carolina, as a two-term governor, four-term attorney general and longtime state lawmaker. His reputation will make it harder for Republicans to change people’s perception, Heberlig said.

However, Whatley is relatively unknown to voters, despite holding very powerful positions in the Republican Party. Cooper may be able to use Whatley’s lower name recognition, as well as the tendency for the president’s party to perform poorly in midterm elections, to his advantage, Heberlig added.

Despite those handicaps, Whatley’s certainly still a “formidable” opponent, Wilson said. After all, Trump won North Carolina three times, if only by a small margin.

“Republicans have a pretty good infrastructure here from their wins in General Assembly races, judicial races and statewide races, so he’s going to be able to run a pretty aggressive campaign,” Wilson said.

The primary election could help Whatley “warm up” and test out messaging before the general election, he added.

At the end of the day, it probably won’t matter who raises or spends more money; it’s about how candidates target their spending that makes the difference, Wilson said.

If it were up to him, he’d focus on a broad media spectrum, from traditional television advertisements to local and national podcasts to social media platforms.

“I would also be physically present in a lot of these communities that are suffering economically, and present a plan that folks can understand and grab hold to,” he said. “If you can do that, you can win this race.”

Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event’s done.
Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.
Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society that promotes sustainable floral practices, said that beyond being more sustainable, local and seasonal flowers can make an event more meaningful.
“If you care about local flowers for your wedding, then you know the story of where those flowers were grown,” she said.","Instead of hiring a florist for her October wedding, Emily Day decided to grow her own flowers in her front yard in Calgary, Canada — a creative challenge that turned into a lesson on the hidden climate costs of the global flower industry. She said her homegrown arrangements were just as beautiful as store-bought ones and cost a fraction of the price.

Day and her fiance built garden boxes out of wooden shipping containers in March and filled them with blooms like yarrow, feverfew, strawflowers and statice. They harvested and dried them in midsummer ahead of fall frosts. On her wedding day, her bouquets featured autumn shades accented by blue echinops from a local farmer and tansy she foraged from roadside ditches.

Because her flowers were dried, they’ll last far longer than a typical wedding arrangement. In total, she spent about 1,300 Canadian dollars ($925), a fraction of what many couples pay florists. Day said growing her own flowers made her think more about the environmental costs behind imported blooms — from the plastic packaging they arrive in, to the fuel used to fly them across continents.

As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into weddings and other special events, some are growing their own bouquets, picking wildflowers or using potted plants. Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event’s done.

Carbon emissions from importing fresh flowers

The path many imported fresh flowers take to North America often begins in South America and involves a supply chain full of carbon emissions, said Kai Chan, professor of sustainability science at the University of British Columbia.

Flowers perish quickly when they are cut, so they are refrigerated and transported on planes, both of which require energy and release planet-warming gases. Growing massive fields of roses, or any other single plant, typically requires clearing trees and other natural vegetation. This practice, known as monoculture, harms the environment by depleting soil nutrients and making the area more vulnerable to pests.

“It’s kind of antithetical to the way that ecosystems work … you’re fighting against nature at every turn,” Chan said.

He said buying flowers from local, small-scale farmers is generally favorable because the blooms don't travel as far and the farmers typically follow practices attuned to the local environment.

Shopping local for sustainable flowers

Holly Lukasiewicz, who owns District 2 Florals in Omaha, Nebraska, incorporates sustainable practices such as sourcing locally and avoiding the green foam blocks that are used to anchor arrangements but typically aren't biodegradable. For an extra fee, she’ll pick up the flowers and compost them. She also presses and preserves flowers for clients.

“When I started my business, I knew that I wanted to recycle everything that I could, compost what I could, repurpose what I could,” Lukasiewicz said.

Lukasiewicz hopes more clients will embrace seasonal and local selections rather than expecting any flower, any time of the year.

For decades, much of the flower industry moved abroad because of trade policies and lower costs. Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.

“Some people prefer locally-grown, sustainable products and are willing to pay that higher price point. But oftentimes most consumers go, ‘I’m going to buy the cheapest one that’s there,’” said Neil Anderson, professor of horticulture at the University of Minnesota.

Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society that promotes sustainable floral practices, said that beyond being more sustainable, local and seasonal flowers can make an event more meaningful.

“If you care about local flowers for your wedding, then you know the story of where those flowers were grown,” she said. “Next year, when your anniversary comes up and you see those flowers in bloom or you see them at the farmers market, they’ll remind you of your wedding.”

Esther Lee, editorial director at The Knot wedding planning website, said that a significant number of couples say sustainability is important to their wedding plans. She said couples hope to personalize their event and give guests a sense of the region where the event is being held.

“There is just such a unique ambiance and element to the local flora of a place,” Lee said.

Artificial flowers are sometimes advertised as a sustainable alternative to fresh flowers, but it is important to evaluate data from manufacturers that back up this claim, said Silvia Bellezza, associate professor of business at Columbia Business School. Many artificial flowers are made of plastic and are imported, so “we shouldn’t take the claim that they are more sustainable at face value,” she said.

For Day, the bride that grew her own flowers, that story didn’t end when the night was over. Her guests took home the dried flowers, and a friend later borrowed several arrangements for her own ceremony.

“That’s what’s cool about them too, is you can reuse them time and time again,” Day said. “And then when they get beat up, unlike plastic flowers, you can just throw them in your compost and say, ‘go back to the earth, see you later.’”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/02/PDTN/87564614007-ap-25295540824705.jpg?crop=5995,3374,x0,y306&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 11:07:18.837343

US battery energy storage capacity has expanded by 13,809 MW over the past year, a 59.4% annual growth rate, according to EIA data.

EIA data reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign confirms the storage sector surge experienced throughout 2024, where the battery capacity increased 66% in the calendar year, has continued deep into 2025.

While percentage growth off a smaller base means that storage is easily outpacing any other traditional generations, it was also second only to utility-scale solar in raw megawatts added, with solar capacity growing by an impressive 31,620 MW over the past year. In comparison, natural gas capacity added 3,417 MW, and nuclear added a neglible amount over the same period.

The EIA data suggests this trajectory will accelerate in the coming year. The administration projects developers will bring an additional 22,053 MW of battery capacity online over the next 12 months, with a map showing the additions with large concentrations of batteries noticeably clustering in Texas (ERCOT), California (CAISO), and more. While Arizona is showing good growth, California and Texas hold over 70% of the total national capacity combined.

At the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) Fall Colloquium, Kelty explored how GM is bringing next-generation battery technologies from lab to commercialization, driving American battery innovation forward. The colloquium is part of the ongoing MITEI Presents: Advancing the Energy Transition speaker series.

At GM, Kelty’s team is primarily focused on three things: first, improving affordability to get more electric vehicles (EVs) on the road. “How do you drive down the cost?” Kelty asked the audience. “It's the batteries. The batteries make up about 30 percent of the cost of the vehicle.” Second, his team strives to improve battery performance, including charging speed and energy density. Third, they are working on localizing the supply chain. “We've got to build up our resilience and our independence here in North America, so we're not relying on materials coming from China,” Kelty explained.

To aid their efforts, resources are being poured into the virtualization space, significantly cutting down on time dedicated to research and development. Now, Kelty’s team can do modeling up front using artificial intelligence, reducing what previously would have taken months to a couple of days.

“If you want to modify … the nickel content ever so slightly, we can very quickly model: ‘OK, how’s that going to affect the energy density? The safety? How’s that going to affect the charge capability?’” said Kelty. “We can look at that at the cell level, then the pack level, then the vehicle level.”

Kelty revealed that they have found a solution that addresses affordability, accessibility, and commercialization: lithium manganese-rich (LMR) batteries. Previously, the industry looked to reduce costs by lowering the amount of cobalt in batteries by adding greater amounts of nickel. These high-nickel batteries are in most cars on the road in the United States due to their high range. LMR batteries, though, take things a step further by reducing the amount of nickel and adding more manganese, which drives the cost of batteries down even further while maintaining range.

Lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries are the chemistry of choice in China, known for low cost, high cycle life, and high safety. With LMR batteries, the cost is comparable to LFP with a range that is closer to high-nickel. “That’s what’s really a breakthrough,” said Kelty.

LMR batteries are not new, but there have been challenges to adopting them, according to Kelty. “People knew about it, but they didn’t know how to commercialize it. They didn’t know how to make it work in an EV,” he explained. Now that GM has figured out commercialization, they will be the first to market these batteries in their EVs in 2028.

Kelty also expressed excitement over the use of vehicle-to-grid technologies in the future. Using a bidirectional charger with a two-way flow of energy, EVs could charge, but also send power from their batteries back to the electrical grid. This would allow customers to charge “their vehicles at night when the electricity prices are really low, and they can discharge it during the day when electricity rates are really high,” he said.

In addition to working in the transportation sector, GM is exploring ways to extend their battery expertise into applications in grid-scale energy storage. “It’s a big market right now, but it’s growing very quickly because of the data center growth,” said Kelty.

When looking to the future of battery manufacturing and EVs in the United States, Kelty remains optimistic: “we’ve got the technology here to make it happen. We’ve always had the innovation here. Now, we’re getting more and more of the manufacturing. We’re getting that all together. We’ve got just tremendous opportunity here that I’m hopeful we’re going to be able to take advantage of and really build a massive battery industry here.”",https://climate.mit.edu/sites/default/files/post-images/MITei-Kurt-Kelty.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:02:00.666509

If we invest in and develop community buy-in and coalition- and trust-building, North Carolina rural communities can define clean energy success for themselves.","On November 13, 20 folks attended the second annual rural clean energy convening in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, co-sponsored by the Center for Progressive Reform and the Center for Energy Education. Attendees included academics, energy policy advocates, small-scale developers, technical experts, and government representatives. We built off last year’s convening, addressing the new North Carolina policy landscape and context given the repeal of federal funding, the state’s proposed unfavorable carbon plan, and rising energy burden in communities.

The main topics of the day were the challenges and opportunities for an equitable and just clean energy transition for North Carolina’s rural communities. Across a diverse range of perspectives, there was one consistent theme: North Carolina’s rural communities are incredible, socially vibrant places, and they deserve better: better housing, better renewable energy resources, and better economic development.

Energy burden — or the high share of household income that goes to energy — is acute in North Carolina, which sits in the top half of states with the highest energy burdens for low-wealth ratepayers. Nearly 1.5 million North Carolinians are “overburdened” by energy costs, meaning that they pay more than 6 percent of their income on energy. Some even pay more for energy than for housing, and many live in rural communities.

Across all income brackets, rural counties have the highest energy burden in the state due to energy-inefficient housing, climate change, and structural disinvestment that has led to disparate rates of poverty and unemployment. North Carolina counties with the highest energy costs — also disproportionately rural — interestingly also tend to have a larger portion of renewable energy projects. While utility-scale renewable energy projects may produce benefits such as higher tax revenues, these projects can ignore structural issues of ownership, wages, and distribution of benefits and may even reinforce or exacerbate extractive practices in the production of electricity.

Participants at the convening highlighted some of the barriers to addressing these energy-related injustices. The rise of AI data centers has complicated what communities can leverage as a benefit. We also discussed false solutions like small nuclear reactors that take a long time to build, compared to clear, easy, real-time solutions like solar and wind resources.

As federal funding has been held up in lawsuits or otherwise totally rescinded — as is the case with most Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding — communities are grappling with understaffed agencies trying to dole out energy efficiency funds or otherwise undertake clean energy projects.

The EnergySaver program is just one example of a new state program intended to lower energy bills but faced with staffing hurdles. The EnergySaver program is supposed to help homeowners and renters across North Carolina cover the cost of energy efficiency and electrification upgrades through HOMES (Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings) and HEAR (Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates) from the IRA. Staff at the Center for Energy Education have heard that some program participants have reported delays processing applications.

Participants also stressed the importance of making sure basic needs are always forefront in the conversation about a clean, healthy, equitable energy transition. Moldy or asbestos-filled housing, lack of clean drinking water, and mental health burdens are all examples of the multilayered concerns in rural communities, some of which are often directly connected to structures that lack energy efficiency or weatherization features. We discussed how to support and educate our commissioners on how renewable energy projects owned by the community are assets. These commissioners may otherwise be persuaded by organized corporate interests, which tend to ignore issues beyond installing and connecting large-scale energy projects to the grid.

Still, there are significant natural strengths of rural North Carolina that can overcome these barriers: social capital, strong communities, growing diversity, and, namely, a growing rural population: of 100 total counties in the state, 80 of them are rural. Indeed, North Carolina’s rural population is the 2nd largest in the country (after Texas). There were 3,474,661 people living in rural North Carolina as of April 1, 2020, with a 2.9 percent increase from 2010 to 2020. With a growing population comes new opportunities to position rural communities as epicenters of wealth-building clean energy initiatives.

Rural communities are also primed for renewable energy development. The rise of agrivoltaics can be mutually beneficial for farmers and communities. Resilience hubs in rural communities can be beacons for cooling and resilience before and after natural disasters. Microgrids and the emergence of balcony solar can encourage energy independence and also promote resilience in the wake of severe weather. Participants also highlighted the role of educating children about solar and their role in the ecosystem to build a more sustainable future through direct participation.

Ultimately, a “rural agenda” is needed to address the multifaceted challenges to a clean energy transition. If we invest in and develop community buy-in and coalition- and trust-building, North Carolina rural communities can define clean energy success for themselves.

Gitanyow Lax’yip (Northwestern British Columbia, Canada) – Ahead of an anticipated Final Investment Decision in 2026, Simigigyet’m Gitanyow (Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs) – a traditional Indigenous government mandated to protect Gitanyow Nation’s lands, resources, and laws – submitted a letter today to 43 banks and pension funds to respect Gitanyow rights, and urge against providing financing or equity investments for the proposed Ksi Lisims liquefied “natural” gas (LNG) project or its developers.

Read the full letter from Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs to major banks and pensions.

Simogyet Watakhayetsxw/Deborah Good:

“Investors considering financing Ksi Lisims LNG need to know that this project is an extremely risky bet for many reasons and continues to face mounting opposition. Gitanyow’s message is clear: we’ll continue to fight for our way of life and stand up against projects like this that threaten our Lax’yip.”

This comes amidst decades of resistance, from these lands and around the world, to LNG and other forms of fossil fuel expansion. 128 civil society organisations have endorsed the Gitanyow letter in solidarity.

Addressing the lack of consent by at least four additional First Nations, the mounting financial risks of LNG projects as the world rapidly transitions to renewable energy, and legal and regulatory climate and environmental threats, the letter states:

“We would like to alert you to significant negative impacts and risks posed to our people and the natural resources on which we rely from the proposed Ksi Lisims liquefied natural gas project. Given our serious concerns, growing legal uncertainty and the withholding of consent for the project by Indigenous Peoples — including Gitanyow — as required under the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to which Canada is a signatory, we strongly urge your institution not to provide financing or consider equity investments for this project or its developers.”

On November 13, Prime Minister Mark Carney designated Ksi Lisims LNG of national significance and referred it to the Major Projects Office for fast-tracking and possible taxpayer-backed support. The 12 million tonnes of gas exported by Ksi Lisims would escalate climate-killing emissions while putting billions in the pockets of foreign-owned and MAGA-linked private equity firms. This also comes on the heels of COP30 in Brazil where the rights and inclusion of Indigenous Peoples rightfully dominated the negotiations.

The letter continues:

“The Gitanyow have never ceded or surrendered title to their lands, rights to their resources, or the power to make decisions within the Lax’yip (Territory)…We have challenged the project in court over threats to salmon populations in the Nass Watershed, climate impacts, inadequate consultation and absence of Indigenous consent..… consent and/or a decision on consent has not been granted for Ksi Lisims LNG by four of the six participating Nations: Lax Kw’alaams, Metlaktla, Kitsumkalum, and Gitxalaa.”

Multiple First Nations have challenged Ksi Lisims LNG legally, including ongoing individual federal court challenges from Lax Kw’alaams Band and Metlakatla First Nation launched in October 2025; Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs challenged Ksi Lisims LNG in BC Supreme Court over dangers to salmon, climate impacts, and failure to properly consult, which was recently dismissed are considering an appeal.

Offering four clear recommendations for financial institutions considering Ksi Lisims LNG financing, Gitanyow leaders requested direct response to this letter within two weeks, by December 15, confirming decisions around denying financing to this project as part of a broader LNG exclusion policy.

Gas-based power-generating resources, such as gas turbines, are well positioned to meet current needs and have seen renewed demand amid the data center boom.
A disproportionate share of expected data center capacity is planned for some of the most constrained grids, such as PJM Interconnection.
A range of resources can enable data center load flexibility, from backup diesel generators to on-site battery energy storage solutions.
In practice, apart from Google, few IT companies have successfully integrated data center load flexibility into utility plans on a large scale.","Although pockets of excess generating capacity exist across the US, data centers' impact on load growth is expected to exceed grid-based power generation and transmission capacity.

Limits to grid-based power generation and transmission capacity do not mean data center power demand will go unmet. Instead, technology, market, and policy approaches that deliver power supply for the grid's most constrained hours and locations will command a premium, as will strategies that quickly provide power independent of the grid.

Gas-based power-generating resources, such as gas turbines, are well positioned to meet current needs and have seen renewed demand amid the data center boom. Battery energy storage solutions also offer scalable near-term capacity but depend on evolving market rules and requirements.

With concerns rising over the slow pace of grid-connected capacity expansion, customer-sited energy resources and capabilities offer a faster path to power. Expansion of these resources may continue long term, especially as data center campuses grow.

US power grids have significant excess generating capacity to accommodate load growth throughout most of the year. In many industries, average capacity utilization is used as a measure of market tightness. In the power sector, coal and natural gas combined-cycle fleets averaged 50% to 55% utilization over the past decade. This suggests incremental new loads could be accommodated by increasing utilization of the existing fleet. However, power markets require supply and demand to stay balanced at all times, from peak summer afternoons to cold winter mornings. To estimate how much new load US power grids can integrate, it is essential to understand the supply-demand balance during the most constrained hours.

During the most constrained hours, excess generating capacity across the US totals about 70 GW, slightly greater than California’s peak electricity demand. Over the next few years, surplus generating capacity is expected to remain within this range, based on the current pipeline of new projects and the outlook for generation retirements and load growth outside of data centers.

At first glance, with a pipeline of about 85 GW of new data center capacity requests expected by 2030, US power markets face a seemingly modest generating capacity deficit of 15 GW. However, data center operators face a much higher level of grid constraints for several reasons. First, to reliably support an additional 85 GW of demand, approximately 100 GW of total capacity, including surplus, is required. Another reason is that surplus generating capacity is not well aligned with expected data center growth on a regional basis. A disproportionate share of expected data center capacity is planned for some of the most constrained grids, such as PJM Interconnection. PJM, named for the original three core states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, is the largest US Regional Transmission Organization; it operates the electric grid and competitive wholesale electricity market for all or parts of 13 Eastern US states and the District of Columbia. PJM surplus capacity has declined sharply in recent years, with recent record-high-capacity auction outcomes pointing to persistent near-term tightness. Upside risk to load growth from other industrial demand — particularly in the grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) — threatens to exacerbate the capacity deficit in that region as well.

Even within a market, spare generating capacity may not be immediately deliverable to new data centers because of regional transmission grid constraints. As the size of new data center facilities or campuses grows — reaching hundreds of megawatts or even gigawatt scale within a few years — the concentration of power demand strains local transmission systems. This may require extensive, time-intensive upgrades, including installation of large transformers and breakers.

Although orders for large turbines have surged over the past 18 months, supply constraints and lengthy project timelines will push much of this new capacity into production in the late 2020s and early 2030s. The power crunch appears most severe through 2028 and 2029, when supply begins to catch up.

For example, PJM’s fast-tracking initiative, completed earlier this year, shows that most new gas capacity will not be in service before 2029, with uprates to existing facilities providing the bulk of near-term additions. Similarly, state-led efforts in Texas to expedite new gas projects are expected to have limited impact until 2029.

Overall, we expect 55 GW to 65 GW of new grid-based gas capacity in the US from 2025 to 2030, roughly double our expectations prior to the data center boom, but still short of incremental needs.

Beyond large gas turbines, utilities and regional power markets have raced to shore up near-term capacity by extending existing resources. Since the start of 2023, plans to retire over 37 GW of coal capacity (one-third of all previously announced coal retirement capacity) have either been delayed or avoided through planned conversions to gas-fired generation — including at least 10 GW since the start of 2025. Deals to restart recently retired nuclear power plants and uprate operating ones are set to deliver around 3 GW of incremental nuclear capacity by 2030. Uprates at existing gas-fired plants will also contribute. Even the restart of recently retired coal plants — likely remade as gas-fired resources — is now under consideration, a scenario unimaginable just a few years ago but revived by tight market conditions and supportive federal actions.

Although grid-connected battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity is poised for significant growth, the data center boom has so far given this technology only a modest 8 GW or 15% uplift through 2030. Faster timelines give BESS an edge relative to other resources, but grid-connected BESS still faces long development queues, while tougher economics persist outside of Texas, California and the Southwest. Still, with scalable near-term capacity in short supply, BESS can enable data centers to capitalize on the potential emergence of new market processes to fast-track grid connections in exchange for self-supplied capacity.

Most incremental near-term capacity will come from new generation capacity and retirement delays, but demand-side strategies — such as deploying enhanced network-utilization technologies, repurposing existing crypto-currency mining facilities into traditional data centers, or adopting advanced chip-cooling techniques to reduce facility peak cooling demand and improve data center energy efficiency — may help avoid some incremental capacity needs. Expanding existing demand-response programs is another option, but it remains uncertain whether market prices can incentivize data center operators to curtail grid consumption, even temporarily, due to operational complexity and the enormous cost of potential service interruptions.

For data centers, load flexibility means dynamically restraining electricity consumption through workload management — such as rescheduling, slowing or re-routing IT tasks to other data centers — or temporarily relying on an on-site power supply during periods of grid stress. If enabled by supportive market rules and processes, flexibility can speed load interconnection by reducing the need for new grid infrastructure.

A range of resources can enable data center load flexibility, from backup diesel generators to on-site battery energy storage solutions. These approaches can be tailored to site-specific factors such as commercial requirements, emissions limits or operator expertise. Instead of waiting for new grid upgrades, flexible data centers that assume delivery risk — the risk that electricity will not be deliverable during periods of grid stress — can position themselves for faster grid connection.

However, making IT workloads grid-responsive remains novel in data center operations and design. In practice, apart from Google, few IT companies have successfully integrated data center load flexibility into utility plans on a large scale. Microsoft’s decade-old collaboration with Black Hills Energy used backup diesel generators to help avoid major investment in new generating resources. Future use cases must continue to address emissions limits, refueling logistics, and potential community opposition.

Moreover, although flexibility addresses the key data center bottleneck of grid-based power generation and transmission capacity, most states and markets do not yet offer a faster path to grid connection for flexible loads. Many of the load flexibility options that states, utilities, and operators are developing for large energy consumers remain undefined and do not yet have regulatory approval.

It seems clear, though, that as new load flexibility rules evolve, especially if they impose more stringent availability requirements, they will favor on-site resources and configurations that rely more on gas-based technologies than on energy-limited resources like shorter-duration BESS.

Because load flexibility does not yet offer a clear path to faster grid connections and requirements remain uncertain, many data center operators are looking to deploy more on-site resources to provide a fully independent power supply, at least temporarily until a permanent grid connection is established.

Since late last year, specialists like Crusoe, Frontier Infrastructure, and Enchanted Rock have unveiled plans to colocate over 26 GW of power supply with data centers by the early 2030s, with potential for more. Clusters have emerged in Texas and the Mid Atlantic (PJM), which are strong natural gas producing regions and have the greatest expected grid-capacity deficit.

On-site power often features smaller generators — such as small gas turbines, fuel cells and reciprocating engines — which are currently favored for their speed, scalability, modularity and availability. Many data center operators envision their on-site power assets shifting to backup roles after a grid connection is secured, while others are considering deeper integration of on-site resources with regional markets. For now, while most on-site generation projects remain in development, several gigawatts are already operating, under construction or backed by firm orders for gas resources.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/corp_1120_USPower?$responsive$,N,,2025-12-02 12:03:02.117048

But about 3,800 additional treatment plants – more than triple the current number – could potentially build biogas capture systems.
Anaerobic digesters generally become economical for plants treating at least one million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD).
But in 2020, the California Environmental Protection Agency estimated adding co-digestion capacity to the state’s wastewater treatment operations would cost about $1.4 billion.
“Most people’s perception of wastewater treatment is that we’re simply a ‘dirty-water utility.’ But [these projects] demonstrate that today’s wastewater utilities are really resource recovery facilities.","Greater Peoria Sanitary District (GPSD) treats 20 to 25 million gallons of wastewater each day and uses some of the resulting biogas to heat its boilers while flaring the rest. But now the Illinois utility has other plans for some of the excess and is banking on monetary and environmental returns.

That biogas will be converted to renewable natural gas (RNG), injected into the natural gas pipeline, and sold as transportation fuel—a slow but steady growing trend among water utilities looking to reduce their emissions while capitalizing on their waste byproduct. And they have the ideal feedstock. Their gas is high in methane and low in nitrogen, meaning its energy-rich and requires relatively minimal treatment steps.

Wastewater treatment plants have actually been capturing and digesting their biogas for about a century, though in the early days, the goal wasn’t energy recovery; it was simply to reduce the sludge they needed to manage. Over time, plant operators realized they were sitting on a resource that could power their pumps, aerators, boilers, and other energy-intensive equipment.

While some projects go a step further and upgrade to RNG, only about 4% of these operations currently do so, says Patrick Serfass, executive director, American Biogas Council (ABC). But about 3,800 additional treatment plants – more than triple the current number – could potentially build biogas capture systems. And if every wastewater facility with enough daily flow installed systems, the sector could capture 171.8 billion cubic feet of biogas each year, producing enough energy to power 1.3 million U.S. households, reports ABC.

What’s holding some operators back is that these projects can be financially risky, especially for small to midsized operations as they come with high capital and operating expenditures. Anaerobic digesters generally become economical for plants treating at least one million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD). Only about 5,000 of them see this volume—that’s less than a third of them. But for the utilities that can and choose to make the investment, there are potential payoffs.

With hundreds of millions of gallons of wastewater entering a treatment plant each day, there can be significant environmental and financial reasons to recover these resources, says Cynthia Finley, director of Regulatory Affairs at National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Operators can lower their emissions, generate revenue if the RNG is sold for injection into the grid, and reduce their energy costs and reliance on fossil fuel if it’s used internally. As importantly, using the RNG onsite can improve the resilience of the utility, allowing operations to continue if there is an interruption in other energy sources.

“But since the cost of building and operating these projects is high and the cost of fossil natural gas is low, they really do not pay for themselves without other incentives, such as state green energy programs or the federal Renewable Fuel Standard program for transportation fuels. These incentive programs can provide enough revenue for the utility to tip the balance in favor of a biogas to RNG project,” Finley says.

Now new private-public partnerships are emerging to help make these projects pencil out for more operators—and to tap into tremendous volumes of stranded biogas. In GPSD’s case, project developer Burnham is managing the risks by absorbing costs to build the processing infrastructure and through performance guarantees, namely ensuring that treatment levels are met.

The utility has no upfront costs and gets tax credits and a royalty on the gas it produces.

“Where we can most help is where facilities have a large capital need. For instance, where discharge volumes are out of compliance and more treatment infrastructure is required. By capitalizing on the byproduct of their process, we tend to be able to bring down net treatment costs while helping meet state and federal standards,” says Chris Tynan, founder and CEO, Burnham.

More states are adopting food waste diversion policies; about 11 of them have done so to date. This movement is opening project opportunities for plants that co-digest their biogas and food scraps. They already have the infrastructure to digest the materials and tend to be in close proximity to the generators.

“It’s a win-win: food processors and municipal solid-waste departments get a cost-effective and sustainable disposal option, while the treatment facility generates more biogas—offsetting energy costs and, in some cases, generating revenue,” Serfass says.

New York City’s Newtown Creek Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility is one of a few that now co-digests organics and sludge to help meet a food scrap diversion mandate while generating product. The facility produced nearly 355,000 MMBtu of RNG in just under two years –enough to heat over 7,400 homes annually. And the project has yielded negative greenhouse gas emissions, avoiding the methane release associated with traditional landfill disposal.

But what about the steep upfront cost? That expenditure and payback varies. But in 2020, the California Environmental Protection Agency estimated adding co-digestion capacity to the state’s wastewater treatment operations would cost about $1.4 billion. But it would save $255 million a year, delivering a return on investment in five to six years.

“These facilities have a long, long lifespan. So, the economics of it really make sense,” Serfass says.

To Brian Johnson, executive director, Greater Peoria Sanitary District, it’s about more. It’s also about helping the public understand what water utilities do.

“Most people’s perception of wastewater treatment is that we’re simply a ‘dirty-water utility.’ But [these projects] demonstrate that today’s wastewater utilities are really resource recovery facilities.

“We can show that we are turning a waste byproduct into a renewable fuel that reduces emissions, generates revenue for ratepayers, and strengthens our region’s sustainability. It’s a smart environmental solution built from infrastructure that the community already owns. And we are using energy from something they produce every day.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/blt53dd34158e663329/692eef3e16c66f4e7aae064e/wastewater_treatment_plant.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:59.728777

In this case, SCE could only spend that money on distribution grid capacity expansion.
The utility could also spend approved money on less urgent grid upgrades or other items entirely, knowing that the CPUC is unlikely to deny future requests for urgent grid upgrades.","Typically, a utility presents one scenario of future electricity demand and grid investment needs, stakeholders provide input, and then regulators approve how much the utility can spend. This worked fine during the decades when there was slow load growth, but electrification brings two sources of uncertainty that break this framework.

First, timing uncertainty. We know California will eventually host millions of electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps. We don't know exactly how much of that will happen in the next 5 to 10 years. California is standing strong by its electrification goals, but recent federal actions are making it harder and more expensive to electrify.

Second, location uncertainty. People and businesses purchase electric cars and trucks when they want to and charge them wherever it is convenient. Mostly, that means predictable locations where vehicles are parked for a long time, like overnight at homes or in depots, where the vast majority of charging needs can be met when there is plenty of spare capacity on the grid. But public charging is more variable and requires more power in a shorter period of time, resulting in hot spots that require power line upgrades.

Timing and location are especially important because whether a part of the grid needs an upgrade or not depends on the capacity of each piece of equipment, how much load it serves today, and how much load it will serve tomorrow.

The number of components that SCE needs to upgrade could vary around 20 percent in either direction from its primary forecast. The old approach—presenting regulators with a single forecast and requesting a fixed budget—no longer works when the range of possible futures is that wide.

Spend too little and the grid is overloaded and unable to reliably serve customers or accommodate electrification. Spend too much and electricity rates increase, which means that fewer people can afford the clean technology that California desperately needs to meet its climate goals.

Our proposal for threading the needle

NRDC recommended that SCE establish a two-way balancing account to fund future grid upgrades to thread the needle between encouraging proactive spending and accommodating uncertainty in how much grid investment is needed. A two-way balancing account provides SCE with an initial reduced budget, allows SCE to collect more money (with limits) if needed, and requires SCE to return unspent money to customers.

There are a couple of ways the CPUC could set the initial approved budget and provide guardrails. For the initial budget, they could go with a conservative approach and approve an amount based on the lower end of future upgrades that are likely needed, or CPUC could approve the amount SCE originally requested, which NRDC found falls in the middle of the range of upgrades we believe are likely necessary.

For both scenarios, SCE would have more rigid limits on the uses of these funds. In past rate cases, SCE would have been given the ability to spend distribution system funding on a wide range of projects. In this case, SCE could only spend that money on distribution grid capacity expansion. Ratepayers are off the hook if these grid upgrade needs don’t materialize. And in either case, CPUC could impose a total spending cap to further protect utility customers, ideally based on the higher end of the likely grid upgrade range.

While other balancing accounts exist, they are a departure from the status quo in California, wherein a utility is approved to spend a set amount for all the near-term investments it can justify; but once this money is approved, the utility can spend it however it wants. Although this model provides utilities with flexibility if investment needs change from the original plan, it can lead to inefficient spending because the utility will aim to spend the full approved budget, even if the projected load growth used to justify the budget does not materialize. The utility could also spend approved money on less urgent grid upgrades or other items entirely, knowing that the CPUC is unlikely to deny future requests for urgent grid upgrades.

A balancing account, with an upper spending limit restricted to distribution grid upgrades, provides the right amount of flexibility in the face of uncertainty and encourages SCE to spend on necessary grid infrastructure in a timely manner.

The CPUC authorized SCE to spend an initial $532 million on grid upgrades based on a conservative scenario that only includes a fraction of the electrification necessary to meet state policy goals. Additionally, to comply with state law and policy goals, SCE can create a memorandum account through which it can spend up to an additional $100 million on the upgrades necessary to support electric transportation load growth only. SCE could spend even more if it must, but that spending is riskier because SCE will have to spend first and collect the money later—and only if the commission approves of what the utility did.

By guaranteeing some recovery in the typical manner without guardrails and also providing an avenue for additional recovery based on reasonableness review, this well-intentioned proposal has two shortcomings.

First, if SCE thinks it may be denied recovering the money it spends, it may not invest enough to keep the grid reliable, which would affect all electricity use, not just electric cars. It could also pinch pennies today and make smaller upgrades, thereby missing out on long-term savings from economies of scale and leaving ratepayers worse off.

Second, because the $532 million authorized has no guardrails, SCE could spend that money on less important things, knowing that it could always justify additional spending through the memo account as critical needs come up.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:31.838642

The renewable energy industry continues to see downsizing for projects and other initiatives. Businesses canceled, closed, and scaled back more than $4.4 billion worth of large-scale renewable energy projects and factories in October, bringing the total cost of projects canceled in the private-sector to more than $28.7 billion in 2025 alone, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of renewable energy projects. The cancellations and scale backs will eliminate nearly 9,000 previously announced and current jobs, bringing the total number of jobs lost to abandoned projects to nearly 30,000 this year.

October’s cancellations and closures (one project was disclosed on Sept. 30) included nine previously announced battery, storage, solar, and electric vehicle factories in Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio and California. Only a single new large-scale project was announced last month according to E2’s tracking — the lowest number of new projects announced in a month since E2 began tracking.

According to the analysis, cancellations, closures, and downsizes are outpacing new project investments and jobs nearly two to one in 2025. About $11 billion in investments and 17,000 jobs have been announced so far in 2025. At the same time, $28.7 billion and nearly 30,000 jobs have been canceled.

“Cancellations are clearly accelerating,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2. “The abandonment of 51 projects this year alone reflects the long-term uncertainty manufacturers and investors are facing about the long-term future of U.S. energy leadership.”

Republican states suffering most

Republican-held congressional districts continue to lose the most from cancellations. Nearly $17 billion in investments that would have created almost 22,000 jobs have been canceled in Republican districts so far in 2025, compared with almost $10 billion and 13,000 jobs in Democratic districts.

“Companies, including many that had already broken ground, begun hiring, or made major capital commitments, are reversing course at an increasing rate,” Timberlake added. “Communities and their constituents are paying the price through lost job opportunities, lost economic development investments and lost tax revenues.”

According to E2’s tracking, new investments were not enough to offset impact from scaled back and abandoned projects. The only new clean energy project announced in October was Eos Energy Storage’s $352 million plans to relocate its headquarters to Pittsburgh and expand its Pennsylvania-based battery manufacturing operation. The Eos project brings total investments announced since E2 began tracking in August 2022 to $132.2 billion.

Cancellations tracked by E2 include projects that were announced or completed prior to August 2022 that are not added to E2’s announcement tracker. This results in inconsistencies between the jobs and investment totals between the cancellation and announcement trackers since many cancelled and closed projects would not impact E2’s announcement tracker.

Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025

COVINGTON COUNTY, AL — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rejected #Reliant Southwest Alabama Storage LLC’s permit application for the Pine Hills Sequestration Hub as incomplete, according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by local residents.

In an August 14, 2025 Notice of Deficiency, EPA informed the company that critical information is missing from their Class VI permit application, including a complete Area of Review map showing all injection wells, producing wells, abandoned wells, water wells, homes, surface water, springs, mines, and other structures where people live or work.

“The EPA is requiring basic public information that should have been included from the start,” said local landowner and attorney Wes Laird. “Our community has a right to see a complete picture of what’s being proposed before a project of this magnitude moves forward.”

The proposed Pine Hills facility would inject approximately 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (waste) per year into underground formations in Covington County — what would be among the largest carbon sequestration projects in the world. The aquifer that supplies fresh water to Covington County residents also supplies much of the Alabama Wiregrass and Northwest Florida.

However, documents released to the community are heavily redacted, with entire pages marked as “proprietary business information.”

Community members note that the application itself acknowledges the presence of wells in the area that were not properly plugged, raising concerns about potential pathways for CO₂ migration.

“This project could impact our groundwater and land for generations,” Laird said. “The public should see the same information as the EPA, not heavily redacted documents.” Community organizers plan to formally appeal the extensive redactions with the EPA. Under FOIA regulations, appellants have 90 days from the date of EPA’s response letter to file their appeal.

The renaming is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to deemphasize or cut the parts of the federal government that support renewable energy, while also expanding federal support for fossil fuels.
“The head of their renewable energy laboratory said, ‘I have nothing to tell you, because you come from the place that has the best renewable energy laboratory in the world,’” Ritter said.
So disappointing.” He was referring to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to cut federal spending in the early months of the Trump administration.
In 1991, the Solar Energy Research Institute became the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of a change by the administration of President George H. W. Bush that also elevated the institution to become part of the country’s national lab system.","The Trump administration has renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, now calling it the National Laboratory of the Rockies, marking an identity shift for the Colorado institution that has been a global leader in wind, solar and other renewable energy research.

“The new name reflects the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation, and honors the natural splendor of the lab’s surroundings in Golden, Colorado,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director, in a statement.

He did not specify what this “broader vision” would mean for the lab’s programs or its staff of about 4,000.

The renaming is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to deemphasize or cut the parts of the federal government that support renewable energy, while also expanding federal support for fossil fuels.

Asked for details, the Department of Energy said in an email that the renaming “reflects the Department’s renewed focus on ‘energy addition,’ rather than the prioritization of specific energy resources.”

A lab spokesman had no additional information about whether there will be changes to programs or headcount at the lab.

Bill Ritter, a Democrat who was governor of Colorado from 2007 to 2011, said it’s reasonable to assume that the name change signals that the federal government is abandoning the lab’s status as a world leader in energy research.

“It’s an iconic research facility,” he said.

Underscoring this point, he recalled a trip to Israel while he was governor.

“The head of their renewable energy laboratory said, ‘I have nothing to tell you, because you come from the place that has the best renewable energy laboratory in the world,’” Ritter said.

After leaving office, he founded the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, which specializes in energy policy research, and is now a consultant on energy business and policy.

Based on this experience, he thinks that anything the Trump administration does to divert from the lab’s mission is harmful to the United States’ ability to remain a major player in the energy economy of the near future.

“We’ll no longer be competitive in renewables research with China or India or other countries that are still heading toward the renewable energy transition at a very fast pace,” he said.

People with close ties to the lab were not surprised by the name change, given the administration’s broader goals.

“In the early days of DOGE people there were whispering about a name change to avoid the ire of MAGAs,” said Matt Henry, a Montana-based social scientist who worked at the lab from February 2024 to August 2025, in a post on Bluesky. “It pissed me off—prioritizing the preservation of the institution at the expense of its [stated] mission? So disappointing.”

He was referring to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to cut federal spending in the early months of the Trump administration. The term MAGA refers to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan and movement.

Dustin Mulvaney, a San Jose State University environmental studies professor, said if the name change is a sign of a significant change in the lab’s work, it would be “like losing several major land grant research universities all at once.”

Mulvaney has done projects in partnership with people at the lab. An important part of the institution’s work, he said, is that its research is free and accessible to the public, helping businesses and universities that may not be able to afford the work of private research firms.

The lab’s mission has included consulting to help communities benefit from new energy technologies, and ensure smooth transitions away from fossil fuels.

This work meant that the lab was out of step with an administration that has said it disagrees with the idea of a transition away from fossil fuels and has sought to impede funding and development of renewable energy.

The lab was established in 1974 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, part of a law signed by President Gerald Ford to facilitate alternatives to importing oil from the Middle East, according to a history on the lab’s website. The U.S. was suffering through high gasoline prices amid tensions with oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” said Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of energy, in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand.”

In 1977, the federal government selected Golden, Colorado, as the location for the lab. In 1991, the Solar Energy Research Institute became the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of a change by the administration of President George H. W. Bush that also elevated the institution to become part of the country’s national lab system.

But the lab’s history has also included budget cuts and periods when its work fell out of favor with presidential administrations, including layoffs and funding cuts under President Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump proposed substantial cuts during his first term, but Congress retained much of the funding.

The Trump administration’s budget proposal, issued in May, calls for cuts across non-defense discretionary spending, including on energy research, but the budget process is still underway.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/98079-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:58.312857

Why are CCAs using green bond prepayment transactions?
Investors gain access to tax-exempt green bonds.
How do green bond prepayments generate savings?
Why is interest in green bond prepayments growing?","Frequently Asked Questions: CCA Green Bond Prepayment Transactions

1. Why are CCAs using green bond prepayment transactions?

Prepayment transactions allow CCAs to reduce the cost of long-term renewable energy contracts by using tax-exempt financing, leading directly to lower utility bills for customers.

2. How much money have CCAs saved through CCCFA so far?

CCCFA has issued $23 billion in prepayment bonds, saving CCA customers roughly $150 million every year, totaling about $4.6 billion over the life of these contracts.

3. How do energy prepayment contracts work?

CCAs prepay for a long-term supply of electricity using proceeds from tax-exempt municipal bonds. Because these bonds carry lower interest rates, the resulting energy price is discounted compared to traditional procurement.

4. How do prepayment transactions support clean energy development?

Prepayments help finance the purchase and construction of new renewable energy projects by providing developers with upfront capital and long-term revenue certainty.

5. Why can CCAs use tax-exempt bonds for energy prepayments?

Federal law permits tax-exempt public entities—including CCAs—to finance prepaid energy contracts using municipal bonds. The IRS and Congress codified this framework in the 1990s.

6. Why are green bond prepayments a competitive advantage for CCAs compared to IOUs?

CCAs can access tax-exempt financing, which investor-owned utilities cannot use. This enables CCAs to secure meaningfully lower energy prices—an important competitive advantage in California’s energy landscape.

7. Have prepayment bonds been used before?

Yes. Municipal utilities have long used similar structures to prepay for natural gas. CCCFA is now leveraging this framework for renewable energy purchases on behalf of CCAs.

8. What is the California Community Choice Financing Authority (CCCFA)?

CCCFA is a joint powers authority created by CCAs to issue green bonds that facilitate energy prepayments. By working together, CCAs gain access to lower-cost capital and greater purchasing power.

9. Who participates in a typical prepayment transaction?

A standard transaction includes:

A CCA purchasing electricity

CCCFA, which issues the bonds and coordinates the structure

A taxable energy supplier providing electricity under a prepaid contract

10. What major parties benefit from the prepayment structure?

CCAs benefit from lower-cost renewable energy.

Customers benefit from lower rates.

Investors gain access to tax-exempt green bonds.

Energy suppliers secure long-term revenue from prepaid contracts.

11. Are more CCAs planning to use these structures?

Yes. Several CCAs that are not yet part of CCCFA have expressed interest, and demand from both CCAs and investors suggests more issuances are likely.

12. How do green bond prepayments generate savings?

Savings come from the difference between taxable and tax-exempt interest rates. Investors accept lower, tax-exempt returns; CCAs pass these lower financing costs directly into discounted energy prices.

13. Is the typical 10% savings rate reliable?

Ten percent is a useful benchmark but not guaranteed. Actual savings depend heavily on market conditions at the time of issuance, and some recent transactions have produced lower discounts.

14. Are there additional fees CCAs must pay to participate?

Underwriting fees and other issuance costs are built into the transaction cashflows. The only additional cost to CCAs is minimal internal staff time.

15. What does it mean that CCCFA’s bonds are “non-recourse”?

Non-recourse means CCAs are not financially responsible for repaying the bonds beyond the structured transaction revenues. The bonds are secured only by the contract rights and cashflows within the prepayment deal—not CCA general funds.

16. Why is interest in green bond prepayments growing?

Early savings have been substantial, the structures are scalable, and investors continue to show strong demand for tax-exempt, climate-aligned bonds. As a result, future issuances are highly likely.",https://cal-cca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7-22-CalCCA_Logo_400x400_Cleaned-Up-Simplified-on-Green.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:40.541916

During the Chairman’s Remarks portion of the meeting, Dare County Board of Commissioners Chairman Bob Woodard provided an update on the county’s ongoing efforts to address the significant challenges occurring on Hatteras Island—particularly persistent flooding and overwash along N.C. Highway 12 and the collapse of 15 homes in Buxton over a six-week period.

Chairman Woodard reported that county officials recently met with NC Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson and representatives from Governor Josh Stein's office, the NC Division of Coastal Management, and the North Carolina Board of Transportation to enable state leadership to fully understand the severity of the conditions impacting the island and its critical infrastructure. He emphasized that these meetings are part of a broader effort to allow officials to see firsthand what residents and visitors are experiencing. Woodard also noted that county officials plan to travel to Raleigh after the first of the year—once legislators return to session—to meet individually with lawmakers.

As he continued his remarks, Chairman Woodard shared a letter he recently sent to North Carolina Governor Josh Stein and every member of the General Assembly regarding the escalating erosion and overwash issues. The letter issues an urgent call for statewide support to address rapidly worsening conditions on Hatteras Island. It outlines severe coastal erosion that has led to repeated home collapses, the increasing vulnerability of N.C. Highway 12—the sole transportation link for Hatteras Island—and the mounting strain on local resources despite more than $275 million invested in beach nourishment by Dare County and its five oceanfront towns over the years.

The letter also details several key requests, including funding the long-established but never-capitalized State Beach Nourishment Fund, advancing long-term strategies identified through the N.C. 12 Task Force and reconsidering the state’s ban on hardened shoreline structures in areas where nourishment alone is no longer sufficient. Chairman Woodard further emphasized that protecting N.C. Highway 12 and stabilizing the coastline is critical not only for the safety and well-being of island residents but also for safeguarding the economic engine that benefits the entire state.

Chairman Woodard concluded his remarks by assuring the public that the Dare County Board of Commissioners and Dare County officials are working diligently every day to address and resolve the challenges facing Dare County and its coastal communities.

For a moment, the North Carolina State Board of Elections listed Rep. Ray Pickett as a primary challenger to House Speaker Destin Hall.","Congressional, judicial, and district attorney hopefuls across the state flocked to Raleigh on Monday to get their names on the ballot.

The Caucus spoke with several first-time and returning candidates about their vision and what to expect from them if elected.

Order in the Court

Democratic Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls was among the first to submit paperwork for her reelection bid. She doesn’t have any primary challengers and is expected to face Republican state Rep. Sarah Stevens of Surry County in the general election.

In an interview, Earls expressed concern with Stevens’ legislative background.

“The voters will have a real choice if Sarah Stevens is my opponent,” Earls told The Caucus. “She has voted to take away so many of the rights that I think are fundamental.”

Earls cited Stevens’ support of abortion restrictions and changes that she sees as reducing North Carolinians’ ability to vote.

Stevens accused Riggs of judicial overreach.

“Anita Earls is a liberal judicial activist who wants our courts, not our duly elected legislature to write the laws,” Stevens said in a statement. “I welcome the opportunity to expose her radical leftist agenda to all North Carolina voters.”

The Democrat also addressed recent pushback to a statement she issued last month criticizing the U.S. Border Patrol’s presence in Charlotte and Raleigh. Republican Supreme Court Justice Phil Berger Jr. called Earls’ statement “irresponsible” and questioned her neutrality.

“Judges are not political commentators and we are not supposed to be advocates,” Berger Jr. wrote. “When we speak as if we are, we blur the boundaries.”

Earls defended her statement, saying she has a First Amendment right and obligation as a statewide candidate to put a spotlight on issues she cares about.

“It’s important not to confuse two different things,” Earls said. “What we do as justices in our opinions is one thing, but voters have the right, I think, to know what our values are and what we stand for. That’s maybe different than in the past.”

Democratic Court of Appeals Judges Toby Hampson and John Arrowood also submitted paperwork for their reelection campaigns. There also will be a competitive Democratic primary for an open Court of Appeals seat between James Whalen and Christine Walczyk.

The Caucus asked Hampson about his involvement in the long-running state Supreme Court election dispute in which Republican Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin sought to overturn his defeat by Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs.

A three-judge panel including Hampson sided with Griffin and ordered the removal of several longtime voters falsely labeled as “never residents.” (The Assembly was first to report that many of those voters actually did live in the state or had in the past.) Hampson dissented, and a federal Trump-appointed judge ultimately ruled in Riggs’ favor.

“There’d never been any evidentiary hearing to determine which of these voters were, in fact, in the right categories or not in the right categories,” Hampson said. “We were just making assumptions about these voters based on their appearance on a list. It just underscores that facts matter.”

Congressional Chaos

Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis announced Monday that he’d seek reelection in the redrawn 1st Congressional District, though he hasn’t yet filed with the State Board of Elections. Republican state lawmakers redrew the northeastern voting lines in an effort to net their party an additional congressional seat. (Punchbowl News first reported on Davis’ plans.)

Davis had debated whether to challenge Republican Rep. Greg Murphy in the 3rd District, since he lives in Snow Hill, which is now in Murphy’s district. Unlike those running for the North Carolina General Assembly, congressional candidates don’t have to live in their districts.

“Many feel Washington, D.C., isn’t serving their needs, and the redistricting battle clearly proves it,” Davis said in a statement. “I’m running in NC-01 to ensure everyone, from the northeast to the coast, has a powerful voice in Congress.”

Republican state Sen. Bobby Hanig filed to run against Davis on Monday. He told reporters he was happy to learn of Davis’ decision to stay in the 1st District.

“We’ll expose Don,” Hanig said. “What he is and what he says he is are two totally different things.”

Hanig must first get through a crowded GOP primary that so far includes Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson, Lenoir County Commissioner Eric Rouse, attorney Ashley Nicole Russell, and Carteret County Sheriff Asa Buck.

Thirteen people submitted paperwork to run for Congress on Monday, including GOP incumbents Chuck Edwards and Richard Hudson and Democratic Rep. Val Foushee.

Foushee, who is in a deep blue district, said she’s optimistic about Democrats’ chances next year and hopes the party adopts an affordability-centric message. “For Democrats, we should be most focused on healthcare and returning jobs,” she said.

Hudson, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he’s hopeful voters will reward Republicans for their legislative agenda, which includes the One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending law.

“The American people in the last election returned Donald Trump to the White House with a very specific agenda, and the Congress has delivered on that agenda,” Hudson said. “So I believe the people are going to reward Republicans.”

Edwards is the lone Republican seen as potentially vulnerable. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report ranks Edwards’ district as Likely Republican. Democrats hope voters in Western North Carolina will want a change in congressional leadership over what they see as a slow federal response to Hurricane Helene.

Edwards said he’s pleased more funds have been approved for North Carolina recently, including $155 million in FEMA grants for infrastructure repairs, but has found himself frustrated over the past year over local governments waiting on reimbursements to be approved.

“It’s inaccurate to say that the recovery has been slower than expected,” Edwards said. “The thing that has been slower than expected is the reimbursement to local governments for the investment that they’ve made in the recovery. The recovery continues to operate at breakneck speed.”

Jamie Ager, a farmer and CEO of Hickory Nut Gap Farms in Fairview, is running in the Democratic primary in hopes of challenging Edwards. He said he respects Edwards’ business experience and accessibility to constituents but feels he’s fallen short on supporting recovery efforts.

“He’s not represented our district and gotten the money from Hurricane Helene that we need to get our feet back under us,” Ager said. “He’s been tone deaf to the frustrations around Helene and to just how much the cost of living is. He doesn’t understand the district.”

Legislative Angling

The showdown is officially on between Republican Senate leader Phil Berger and Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. Both filed paperwork for what is likely to be the most consequential and intriguing primary race in the state.

In a twist, Democratic Sen. Dan Blue of Wake County also filed for reelection. Blue’s colleagues ousted him from leadership earlier this year, and Blue told me the 2025-2026 legislative session would be his last.

He’s had a change of heart, though. Blue was the most conservative-voting Democrat in his chamber, siding with the GOP on 69% of votes this year. By comparison, new Democratic leader Sydney Batch has voted with the majority 62% of the time. If Democrats break the GOP supermajority in the Senate next year, Blue could become a key swing vote and thorn in the side of the new Democratic caucus leadership.

One other filer of note: Sen. Norman Sanderson of Pamlico County was arrested earlier this year for a DWI and has since apologized to his constituents. He filed Monday to seek reelection.

So far, seven incumbents have primary challengers:

Page aims to unseat Berger, the state’s top Republican.

Harnett County Commissioner William Morris is challenging Republican Rep. Joe Pike.

Holly Ridge Mayor Pro-Tem Joshua Patti is running against Republican Rep. Carson Smith of Pender County.

Former Democratic Rep. Michael Wray will have a rematch with Rep. Rodney Pierce of Halifax County (in the closest legislative primary last year, Pierce defeated Wray by 34 votes, or 0.3 percentage points).

Armstrong Farms manager Darren Armstrong is running against Republican Rep. Keith Kidwell of Beaufort County.

Democratic Rep. Amanda Cook, who was recently tapped to fill the vacancy left by Rep. Cecil Brockman of Guilford County, has a contested primary that so far includes Angie Williams-McMichael of High Point and Joe Alston, a former executive director of the NC NAACP.

Caroline Eason of Lawndale is looking to unseat Republican Rep. Kelly Hastings of Gaston County.

Random Tidbits:

Don Brown, a staunch vaccine critic, and Elizabeth Temple, a former substitute teacher who was accused of making offensive comments to elementary school students, filed for the U.S. Senate primary against Republican Michael Whatley (who hasn’t submitted paperwork yet).

While he may not have a good chance at winning in a strong Republican seat, he was hands-down the tallest candidate I’ve ever seen: At 6 feet, 9.5 inches, Democrat Harry Morley is looking to upset Republican Rep. Pat Harrigan in the 10th Congressional District.

For a moment, the North Carolina State Board of Elections listed Rep. Ray Pickett as a primary challenger to House Speaker Destin Hall. The error was quickly corrected. (They both represent parts of Watauga County.)

Dear Lieutenant General Graham,

We write to respectfully request a 45-day extension of the public comment period for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) regarding operations of the Detroit Dam within Oregon’s Willamette Valley System. The draft SEIS was released on November 14, with the comment period closing on December 29. We urge the Corps to provide a longer and more accessible comment window that will allow meaningful and informed public engagement on this highly impactful document.

The SEIS is both lengthy and technically complex, addressing issues that directly affect drinking water quality, economic stability, and public health across several communities in the Santiam Canyon and Willamette Valley. Recent experience with deep drawdown operations, including those at Green Peter Reservoir, have revealed the potential for extensive turbidity, severe impacts to drinking water systems, and significant economic losses for surrounding communities. These concerns underscore the importance of ensuring that residents, local governments, Tribal governments, utility providers, business owners, and other stakeholders have sufficient time to review and respond to this SEIS.

While a 45-day comment period is already a relatively short timeline for a document like this, the currently scheduled comment window also spans the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Hanukkah, among others. These weeks are among the most challenging of the year for public participation, as reduced staffing, competing obligations, and widespread travel mean most Oregonians are far more concerned about weather delays and family recipes than comment periods. The combined effect of a shortened timeline and a holiday-dominated review period will significantly hinder the ability of Oregonians to provide thoughtful and informed feedback.

Given the anticipated impacts of potential operational changes at Detroit Dam, including those related to drinking water for more than 200,000 downstream residents, the Kokanee fishery, and economic conditions in the Santiam Canyon, it is essential that the review process maximize transparency and accessibility. A reasonable extension of the comment period would help accomplish this goal and ensure that the Corps receives the robust, substantive input needed to support a well-informed decision.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the USACE extend the comment period by an additional 45-days to provide stakeholders with adequate time to fully assess the SEIS and prepare comprehensive comments. We believe this extension is both necessary and in the public Interest.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to continued collaboration to ensure that the management of the Willamette Valley System supports the recovery of endangered fish species while also meeting the needs, safety, and well-being of Oregonians and the communities they call home.",https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Press-Release-Photo-3.jpeg,N,,2025-12-02 18:03:13.148770

Entergy officials stress that the plants will benefit all utility customers because of Meta's contributions to the infrastructure.
Meta's data center in Richland Parish and the nearby plants are located in one of the poorest regions of the state.
Proponents of the facility highlight the opportunity for economic development, including 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs once the data center is complete.","Entergy broke ground Monday on a pair of new electricity plants being built to power Meta's massive AI data center in northeast Louisiana, part of the utility's plan to roll out billions of dollars in new infrastructure for the tech company's historically large project.

The gas-fired plants located near the data center will deliver around 1500 megawatts of power and will begin generating in 2028. A third plant in St. Charles Parish slated to help meet the tech company's energy needs is currently awaiting permits, said Brandon Scardigli, a spokesperson for Entergy Louisiana.

The utility is constructing other resources for Meta as well, including substations and transmission lines, totaling more than $5 billion in new infrastructure.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, president and CEO of Entergy, the state's largest utility.

But while Entergy has described the project as beneficial to ratepayers since much of the new infrastructure will be paid for by Meta, it has come under sharp criticism from environmental groups, consumer advocacy organization and other large industries. Criticism includes concerns that other ratepayers will have to cover project costs and whether the data center's large power demands will affect grid reliability.

Meta’s data center will need roughly three times the amount of electricity that the city of New Orleans uses in a year and increase Entergy's electric needs in the state by around 30%.

Savings?

Entergy officials stress that the plants will benefit all utility customers because of Meta's contributions to the infrastructure. The tech company will pay for all costs of the new generators over a 15-year contract, as well as storm recovery costs, leading to a projected $650 million in customer savings, according to the utility.

But both environmental advocacy and oil, gas and petrochemical companies disputed Entergy's plan to build the new infrastructure, arguing over the months-long regulation process that the plan risked increased bills for all types of customers.

Of particular concern to opponents is the plants' lifespan of up to 40 years compared to Meta's contract of 15, which could potentially leave other ratepayers on the hook if the tech company leaves. All customers will also pay for a $550 million transmission line.

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups opposing the plan have also warned of grid reliability and environmental risks of the new fossil fuel-powered plants, which will produce pollution and climate-warming emissions.

Entergy, meanwhile, says the new generation added to the system will be ""among the most efficient in the state"" and provide long-term reliability benefits to customers. Meta is also planning to build 1500 megawatts of solar power in Louisiana through its deal with Entergy.

The utility also argues that the relatively newer plants will be able to serve all customers if Meta leaves, allowing them to retire older facilities after the 15-year deal.

Meta's data center in Richland Parish and the nearby plants are located in one of the poorest regions of the state. Proponents of the facility highlight the opportunity for economic development, including 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs once the data center is complete.

With just over 11 months to go, all signs point to a favorable environment for Democrats. If the elections were held today, it’s a good bet that they would win back the House of Representatives, as they did the last time Trump was president. They may even flip one or two governor’s seats and a handful of state-legislative chambers.

Currently, however, it’s unclear just how strong a national environment they will enjoy next year, and whether it will be capable of lifting candidates in places that voted for Trump by significant margins in 2024. So today, we’ll take a look at where things stand across several key metrics and determine what we can glean from the data we have.

The 2025 Election Results

One sign of very real optimism for Democrats is the party’s performance in last month’s elections—specifically, in the races for New Jersey and Virginia governor. Yes, both states have voted blue at the top of the ticket for the better part of at least the last decade-and-a-half. But it was the fashion in which Democrats won that impressed:

In both contests, the Democratic candidates won by double digits;

They outperformed the party’s past nominees in both places dating back to 1993 in New Jersey and 1965 in Virginia, and their approximately nine-point over-performance of Kamala Harris was a stronger showing than Democrats enjoyed in 2017 versus Hillary Clinton in these states;

Turnout in each state also surpassed levels seen in the 2022 midterm election, a sign of very real enthusiasm among Democratic voters; and

Especially important: there is evidence in both the exit polls and post-election polling that the Democratic gubernatorial candidates won back small but meaningful shares of 2024 Trump voters.

It’s difficult to extrapolate from these results as we look forward to 2026 to guess what the national House popular vote margin might look like. In 2017, Democrats won the Virginia governor race by nine points and the New Jersey race by 13.5, but the following year they won the House popular vote by a smaller 8.4 points. However, the fact that Democrats’ margins in this year’s contests were larger than they were in 2017 portends a national environment that may well be at least as favorable as the one they experienced in 2018.

Special Elections

Perhaps the most hopeful sign for Democrats right now is their performance in special elections. According to data from election analyst Nathaniel Rakich, the median swing in states and districts with special elections this cycle (relative to the partisan baseline of those places) has been 11 points toward Democrats. In the Trump era, that is the largest swing for either party.

As the above chart shows, Democrats in the Trump era have routinely had an edge in these off-year elections, and yet that has not always translated to success in the subsequent general election. However, the last time the party came close to their current 11-point median swing was a nine-point margin in 2018—when, like now, they were the out-party looking to bounce back in a midterm at a time when Trump was president. Coupled with this year’s election results, this is a signal that Democrats are likely heading into a “blue wave” type of environment next year.

The Generic Ballot

Perhaps the best tool available for gauging how the country is thinking about the midterms outside of actual election results is the generic congressional ballot (or GCB), a poll question asking which party Americans want to see control Congress in the upcoming election. As we have previously noted, these polls in recent midterm cycles have been predictive—as far as 18 months out—of not just which party is likely to have the advantage in the upcoming elections but sometimes even what their margin in the national House popular vote will be.

According to two different trackers, at the time of this year’s November elections the GCB was around three points in favor of Democrats (and their candidates in the most high-profile races far exceeded that). Since then, it has ticked up by a point or two. In another poll conducted by

, likely voters were pushed to pick one party or the other and gave Democrats a 7.6-point edge (53.8 to 46.2).

By comparison, though, around the same time in the 2018 cycle, the GCB already showed an 8.9-point advantage for Democrats. Moreover, the final margin that cycle indeed ended up being an almost identical 8.6 points. So, currently, even in their best-case scenario, Democrats are underperforming relative to their last big midterm as the out-party.

All this also suggests that the GCB has been a better predictor of the midterm picture than the 2025 elections or special elections that precede it. One of these two metrics will have to give come next November. It’s possible the Democrats’ advantages in the GCB will improve before then to match their other performances. But there is a world of difference between a national environment that mirrors this year’s (~D+15) or even 2018’s (D+8.6) versus one that is only D+4.

Trump’s Approval Rating

A quick reminder of how a president’s approval rating affects their party’s midterm prospects:

[One] strong historical predictor of midterm results is the approval rating of the incumbent president, which correlates highly with their party’s seat loss in the House. The only presidents in the polling era whose parties experienced a net seat gain in a midterm election (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush) enjoyed approval ratings north of 60 percent (66 percent and 63 percent, respectively). But even a strong approval rating doesn’t guarantee success for a president’s party. […]

In his first term, Trump’s Republicans lost 42 House seats. Given the more constricted House map this time around, it’s very unlikely his party’s losses will be that deep next year, no matter his personal standing. However, a low approval won’t do them any favors…

Indeed, one phenomenon that has remained consistent in politics for decades: a poor approval rating for the president virtually guarantees his party will lose seats.

After a relatively stable period stretching from the beginning of July to mid-October, President Trump’s net approval rating has taken a hit, dropping from -7.6 percent on October 20 to -14.7 as of last week (though it has ticked back up slightly to -13.1 this week). This trend is evident at the issue level as well. On his best issue, immigration, Trump had been holding steady for much of the July to October period, with a net approval rating of around -3 percent. Over the past month, however, that dropped to -8.1 percent, the worst standing of his second term. He is in even worse shape on the economy, as his approval ratings on trade (-17.8), the economy (-21), and especially inflation (-34.1) have all slid.

It is possible that Trump, who has defied political gravity time and again, is now being weighed down by the six-year itch.

Perceptions of the Economy

Much like presidential approval, the state of the economy can have a strong influence on election outcomes. A robust economy isn’t always a guarantee of success for the incumbent party, but a bad one—or at least one that voters believe is bad—almost always creates an unfavorable national environment for them. The problem for Trump and the Republicans is that there are few signs that any metric is better today than it was back in 2018, when they got shellacked, while several key things are worse.

On the surface, the economy today looks somewhat similar to that of 2018. Inflation has come down from its recent surge to just three percent today, though this is still higher than it was seven years ago (2.5). The unemployment rate is around 4.4 percent, up a bit from seven years ago (3.8 percent) but not terribly alarming.

The problem for Republicans, however, is that many voters still do not feel as though things have gotten better under their leadership, and many are worried about the future. According to the University of Michigan, the current consumer sentiment index, which gauges how consumers feel about the state of the economy, is just 53.6. For comparison, that figure was 98.6 in the run-up to the 2018 midterms.

We can see a similar story in a recent (and brutal) Fox News poll. Among the results:

Three-quarters (76 percent) of voters said that economic conditions today are either “only fair” (34 percent) or “poor” (42 percent, a plurality);

A strong plurality (46 percent) said they had been “harmed” by the economic policies of the Trump administration (for context, no more than 43 percent ever said the same about President Biden’s policies in Fox’s polling);

Sixty-two percent blamed Trump rather than Biden (32 percent) for current economic conditions;

A majority (52 percent) said inflation is “not at all” under control;

Majorities said their costs have gone up since one year ago for groceries (85 percent agreed), utilities (78 percent), healthcare (67 percent), housing (66 percent), and gas (54 percent); and

Perhaps worst of all for Republicans: 53 percent of respondents in the poll said they think Democrats have a better plan for making things more affordable than does the GOP (43 percent).

In a September CBS poll, the top words Americans gave to describe the country’s economy were “uncertain” (61 percent) and “struggling” (54 percent). Sixty-seven percent expected prices to go up in the coming months.

These poor economic perceptions have already hurt Republicans in one election. As we discussed in our post-election analysis last month, voters in places like Virginia who believed the economy was not in good shape voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And as we established above, many are souring on Trump’s handling of the economy. According to Nate Silver’s latest aggregates, the president’s net approval on inflation, specifically, is deeply underwater, with just 31.3 percent of Americans approving against fully 65.4 percent disapproving.

If things don’t improve between now and next November, Republicans will likely be in for a world of hurt.

Issue Trust

One of the most important predictors of Trump’s success in last year’s election came in pre-election polling from Gallup, which found that voters saw Republicans as the party “better able to handle the most important problem” facing America. Gallup considered this question to have a strong relationship to past presidential election outcomes—and it turned out to be prescient.

Fast-forward one year and that same indicator has now flipped. Whereas voters before the last election trusted Republicans over Democrats by a margin of 50 to 44 to handle the top issue, they now trust Democrats by four points, 47 to 43.

Polls from David Shor and The Argument have shown a similar reversal in the Democrats’ fortunes. According to the Argument’s Lakshya Jain:

We asked voters about their top two issues and, unsurprisingly, 60 percent of voters ranked “cost of living” as a top-two issue in our survey. But despite Trump’s tariff policy and the continuing frustration with high grocery and consumer-goods prices, Democrats won these cost-of-living voters by just under half a percentage point in our survey.

However, he adds:

Those numbers aren’t good for Republicans, but they’re a lot better than Trump’s nightmarish approvals on those issues are… This suggests that Democrats face real trust problems on the economy that haven’t really gone away yet, despite voters giving Trump exceptionally poor marks for his economic stewardship.

A year from now, Democrats may have a more robust trust advantage over the Republicans on handling the economy, but they still have work to do to restore that trust following four years in with which many voters were left feeling completely dissatisfied with the party’s leadership on this issue.

Overall, the picture looks promising for Democrats ahead of next year. However, we want to end with an obligatory note of caution, specifically, regarding the Senate. In a world in which the national environment mirrors 2018, Democrats can expect to successfully defend all of their Senate seats and likely flip two of Republicans’: Maine and North Carolina. But beyond those, they will be forced to win seats in states that voted for Trump by at least 11 points last year, such as Iowa, Ohio, and Texas. And that means the party will need an even stronger national environment than they had in 2018 to win back the majority.

Jain put together a helpful graphic showing what the outcomes in these types of Senate races would look like if Democrats merely repeat their last “wave” performance:

This is why we at TLP write so often about the need for Democrats to address their structural issues. Winning big in midterm and other off-year elections delivers real benefits for the party—namely, they gain power and subsequently get to wield it. But three of the most important institutions in American politics—the presidency, Senate, and Supreme Court—will become harder to capture over time if they can’t address their longstanding weaknesses and become more competitive in right-leaning places.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yatA!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325a1150-6c29-4557-87d4-e20553adb502_1024x683.jpeg",N,,2025-12-02 12:03:07.338085

“Senators don’t spend a lot of time negotiating with the House; they negotiate with the White House,” Golden said.","Maine Blue Dog Democrat Jared Golden is chasing the permitting white whale during his last year in the House, but he doesn’t seem to care if many other Democrats join him.

Golden is the primary co-sponsor of the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776 from Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act review process, including enacting new litigation limits. It could reach the House floor as soon as next week.

But Golden is not necessarily working on convincing lawmakers to his left about the legislation’s merits. In fact, Golden says, he was at times willing to be even more aggressive than Westerman.

Advertisement

It’s that independent streak that has defined his time in the House and helped him secure reelection in a swing district — and that is contributing to his planned departure.

Golden said he would support immediately “deeming projects approved if the government can’t get their ducks in a row in a certain amount of time.”

“I’d rather put the impetus on the government — if you can’t do it in like two years or whatever it is, you move forward,” said the fourth-term lawmaker.

Such thinking has separated Golden from most other Democrats, who want to either preserve NEPA scrutiny of projects or only make modest changes. Golden is not spending too much time on them.

Rep. Adam Gray of California, also a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, was the only other Democrat who voted for the “SPEED Act” in committee during a markup last month. Outside Natural Resources, the bill has a handful of other moderate Democratic co-sponsors.

The day before the markup, wearing blue jeans, a blue flannel shirt and work boots, Golden came across more like a frustrated apolitical outdoorsman than a congressional dealmaker.

Indeed, the 43-year-old Marine veteran’s frustration with Capitol Hill prompted his decision to retire, writing, “Simply put, what I could accomplish in this increasingly unproductive Congress pales in comparison to what I could do in that time as a husband, a father and a son.”

Looking ahead at his last year at the Capitol, Golden offered light scorn for just about everyone, from his fellow Democrats who he says don’t understand the NEPA bill to Republican strategists who don’t seem to want Democrats to support the legislation anyway.

“I want to see something get done,” he said. “So I’m going to ignore their political desires and think more about how do we show momentum in the Senate.”

Westerman wants a vote on the NEPA bill before the end of the year. He can probably make it pass the Republican-controlled House with ease. The big negotiations, Golden says, will be in the Senate, where legislation needs a filibuster-proof majority.

“Westerman knows that his bill is not going to become law without working with Democrats, but they’re also not going to negotiate if they feel like Democrats aren’t sincere in wanting to get to ‘yes,'” Golden said.

Golden did help negotiate a bipartisan amendment — passed during the markup — to prevent the president from canceling permitted projects.

Key senators on permitting, like Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), have made similar demands in response to the Trump administration’s attack on renewable energy projects.

Still, many Natural Resources Committee Democrats wanted more guarantees for renewable energy. Some call the legislation a giveaway to fossil fuels. Members like Democrat Scott Peters of California have been working on finding compromise between both camps.

Golden says he’s “not hostile” to renewable energy but thinks some Democrats tend to ignore the fine print, pointing to offshore wind projects’ impacts on fishermen, which he called the “lifeblood of the entire coastline.” He also has concerns about Maine’s rush to build commercial solar energy, including ramifications for farmland.

There could be changes to the legislation when it hits the House floor. But those amendments would probably not be favorable to Democrats.

Golden said that “based on some conversations I’ve had,” Republican leaders will “probably try and pull the bill right.” “Maybe Bruce convinces them not to do that,” Golden said, referring to Westerman.

“I’m usually of the mind, on any given issue, half the people that are toeing the party line in either party, it’s actually not what they fully believe,” Golden said. “If you could remove all the various political pressures, they would be closer to where my head is at.”

Golden said he hasn’t talked about the NEPA bill with the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, ranking member Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.

“Senators don’t spend a lot of time negotiating with the House; they negotiate with the White House,” Golden said.

House Natural Resources ranking member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a progressive, is often on the opposite side of Golden on many energy and environmental issues, but Huffman says the lines of communication are open.

“Obviously Jared Golden and I have different politics. But I have appreciated him as a straight shooter. He doesn’t blindside you. He communicates with me and my staff in a way I appreciate, and that doesn’t always happen,” said Huffman.

Members on both sides — including Huffman — insist they’re open to a broad, bipartisan deal on permitting. They’ve been saying that for years now.

“The R’s are going to have to decide if they want to take credit for getting something done,” Golden said. “And the Dems will have to decide if they want a share of that. Or if it’s just going to be like, ‘Oh no, we’re going to win the House in ’26 and the White House in ’28. But, oh shit, the margins are tight.‘”

Golden added, “You could see how in another world we’re just like sitting here having this conversation in 2030.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/94/33/f3b6d128482eae05de37e0ffcd38/u-s-congress-41832.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 10:02:42.734607

LUBBOCK, TX, UNITED STATES, December 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Flower Turbines announces that it can help solve the energy problem for data centers in 3 ways:

1. In windy areas, around the periphery and parking lots

2. In windy areas, on rooftops

3. Even if the data center isn’t in a windy area, Flower Turbines can recycle the cooling exhaust into new wind energy

Data centers are looking for fast ways to decrease their electricity bills and avoid poor publicity from their taking away electricity from the public. Flower Turbines offers a quick solution to these problems that is also environmentally friendly for people and birds.

Flower Turbines makes small wind turbines that are special in many ways. One of the game-changing innovations of great interest for data centers is their patented “cluster” or “bouquet” effect; when placed close together properly, each one added to a group makes the whole group perform better. As few as 4 turbines together produce the electricity of 8 separate turbines. This gives data centers and businesses of all kinds cost and space effectiveness greater than alternatives.

A presentation for data center customers can be found at https://d528cc30-602d-4d22-97c0-a5de10f37782.filesusr.com/ugd/f810b5_c6aec3a1f5e241d88eb755acd96bbf59.pdf

The U.S., the world’s top LNG exporter, shipped 10.9 million metric tonnes last month, up from 10.1 mmt in October despite having one fewer day in the month, according to LSEG data.

Cheniere Energy, the largest U.S. LNG exporter, boosted shipments to 4.6 mmt from its two Texas plants, compared with 4.1 mmt in October. Venture Global LNG, the second-largest exporter, held steady at 3 mmt in November, LSEG ship-tracking data showed.

LNG plants typically operate more efficiently in cooler conditions. Average temperatures along the Gulf Coast were about 8 degrees Fahrenheit lower in November than in October, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.

Surging LNG exports pushed U.S. natural gas demand for liquefaction to a record 18 billion cubic feet per day in November. Daily demand topped 19 bcfd for the first time last week. Henry Hub gas prices averaged $4.47 per mmBtu in November, up from $3.36 in October.

EUROPE REMAINS KEY MARKET

Europe received 70% of U.S. LNG exports in November, or 7.5 mmt, up from 69% in October. Turkey emerged as a major buyer, taking 12 cargoes totaling 0.9 mmt, compared with just one cargo in October.

Exports to Asia fell to 1.75 mmt, or 16% of the total, from 1.96 mmt in October, as spot demand in Northeast Asia remained weak. Latin America received 0.66 mmt, slightly higher than October, while Egypt bought 0.84 mmt amid domestic supply challenges.

European benchmark Dutch Title Transfer Facility prices averaged $10.40 per million British thermal units in November, down from $10.88 in October. The Japan Korea Marker averaged $11.25, up from $11.11.

“The arbitrage opportunity for U.S. LNG cargoes to Asia via the Cape of Good Hope remains shut, which will lead to a continued influx of flexible U.S. cargoes into Northwest Europe,” LSEG said in a note.

If you’re in an area without charging infrastructure, which is most of America, you’re fine.
The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work.
The post The EV Truck Reality Check and Why Edison Motors’ Hybrid Might Be What Actually Works appeared first on FreightWaves.","I’m a diesel guy. Specifically, I’m a CAT guy. That’s not nostalgia talking or resistance to change, it’s 25-plus years of experience knowing what keeps trucks moving and freight delivered when conditions get ugly. Diesel has always given me peace of mind because it works. You can find fuel anywhere. The technology is proven. When something breaks, mechanics know how to fix it. In an industry where downtime means lost revenue and missed commitments, that reliability isn’t optional.

So when the EV conversation started dominating trucking discussions, my initial reaction was skepticism bordering on dismissal. Battery-electric trucks looked like solutions engineered by people who’d never operated in conditions where equipment failure has real consequences. The range limitations, charging infrastructure gaps, and operational disruptions seemed like deal-breakers that no amount of government subsidies or manufacturer marketing could overcome.

Then I started paying attention to what Edison Motors was building in British Columbia, and I realized something important: EVs can work in trucking if you actually engineer them for how trucking operates, rather than forcing trucking to adapt to technology limitations.

But before we get to Edison, let’s talk about why the Trump administration just pulled EV tax credits for commercial trucks. It’s not some political statement or shift in environmental priorities, it’s an acknowledgment of reality. America isn’t ready for wholesale adoption of electric trucks because we never did the planning and infrastructure work necessary to make it viable.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

Ford just announced an electric truck for the European market in 2026 with a 186-mile range. For UK operations where you can cover the entire country in a day and the charging infrastructure is relatively dense, that may work. Drop that same truck into American long-haul operations, and it’s useless. The geography doesn’t match, the infrastructure doesn’t exist, and the operational economics don’t work when you’re stopping for multi-hour charging sessions that turn a 10-hour driving day into a 15-hour ordeal with no additional revenue.

Range anxiety isn’t just about miles, it’s about operational flexibility and peace of mind. With diesel, if you need to adjust your route for traffic, weather, or a last-minute load change, you do it. If you’re running low on fuel, you pull into any of the thousands of truck stops and refuel in 15 minutes. That flexibility is what makes trucking work. Battery-electric trucks with fixed range and dependency on sparse charging infrastructure eliminate that flexibility. You’re locked into planned routes with no room for adjustment, and if something goes wrong, you could be stranded waiting for a tow or an hours-long charging session.

For someone whose career has depended on CAT diesels that work in conditions where failure means you’re stuck until a mechanic can reach you, which might be hours or days depending on where you broke down, the idea of voluntarily introducing that kind of vulnerability through technological limitations makes no sense. Diesel works because it’s proven, reliable, and supported by infrastructure that exists everywhere trucks operate.

But Edison Motors changed my thinking on whether EVs can work in trucking, because they approached the problem differently than everyone else.

Edison emerged from logging operations in British Columbia. If you know anything about logging, you know it’s an environment where equipment either works or you’re in serious trouble. You’re operating in remote areas, harsh weather, demanding terrain, and conditions where breakdowns can strand you far from help. Chase Barber and his partners weren’t building trucks to meet regulatory requirements or chase government subsidies, they were solving problems they faced daily running equipment in some of the most unforgiving conditions imaginable.

When they looked at available EV options, they saw the same problems every trucker faces: range limitations, reliance on charging infrastructure, and operational disruptions that make battery-electric trucks impractical for how trucking actually works. So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.

Edison’s trucks feature electric drivetrains with onboard CAT diesel generators that continuously recharge the system. It’s basically a diesel-electric locomotive concept adapted for highway trucking. The electric motors provide instant torque, regenerative braking, and reduced maintenance on brake systems and transmissions. But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.

Here’s what makes this brilliant for someone who trusts diesel: you get the efficiency and performance benefits of electric drive without giving up the reliability and infrastructure compatibility that makes diesel work. You’re not dependent on charging stations that may or may not exist where you need them. You’re not locked into a fixed range with no flexibility. You maintain an unlimited range as long as you can find diesel fuel, which is everywhere. And you’re using proven CAT generator technology rather than betting operations on battery systems that are still evolving.

The peace-of-mind factor is huge. With Edison’s hybrid approach, you can adjust your route or extend your day. If you’re in an area without charging infrastructure, which is most of America, you’re fine. If something goes wrong with the electrical system, you’ve got a diesel generator that can get you to a repair shop rather than being stranded waiting for a specialized EV technician.

Edison just received Canadian regulatory approval to manufacture and sell these hybrid heavy-duty trucks commercially. That’s an actual production vehicle competing in the real market. The approval validates that hybrid approaches can meet safety and emissions standards while addressing operational realities that pure battery-electric solutions ignore.

The fact that this innovation came from a small company emerging from logging operations rather than from major manufacturers or government programs tells you something important about where practical solutions come from. Legacy manufacturers built EVs around battery technology that doesn’t meet operational requirements, then expected infrastructure and regulations to catch up. Government mandates pushed carriers toward technology that doesn’t work for their business models. Meanwhile, Edison listened to what truckers actually need and built solutions that address real-world problems.

This pattern keeps repeating. When FMCSA couldn’t build practical tools to combat chameleon carriers, private companies like Freight Validate and Genlogs stepped in with solutions that work. When legacy systems couldn’t keep pace with technological change, startups built better platforms. When manufacturers focused on removing drivers through automation, Edison focused on giving drivers better tools to be more productive.

The UK’s EV success stems from matching technology to operational environments. Shorter distances, denser infrastructure, coordinated planning, and fleet operations aligned with current EV capabilities created conditions in which the technology could succeed. The US has none of those advantages for long-haul trucking, which moves most freight across the country. We needed better planning, more infrastructure investment, and technology that fits American trucking’s operational realities before pushing aggressive electrification timelines.

The Trump administration’s pulling EV tax credits acknowledges what should have been obvious from the start, we’re not ready. The infrastructure isn’t there. The technology doesn’t match how American trucking operates. And throwing subsidies at the problem without addressing fundamental operational and infrastructure gaps was never going to work.

But that doesn’t mean electric trucks can’t work in trucking. Edison’s success in some of the most demanding conditions imaginable, logging operations in BC’s interior, where equipment failure isn’t an inconvenience, it’s a crisis, proves that EVs can work if you engineer them right. The key is to build around operational realities rather than forcing operations to adapt to technological limitations.

For me, diesel will always be what I know and trust. CAT 3406s have kept me moving and freight delivered through conditions that would have killed lesser equipment. That reliability and peace of mind aren’t something you give up lightly. If Edison Motors has taught me anything, it’s that EV technology can work even in the woods of British Columbia if you approach it with practical engineering rather than regulatory fantasy.

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work. You keep the infrastructure compatibility, operational flexibility, and the peace of mind that come with proven technology. But you add efficiency benefits, reduced maintenance, and emissions improvements that address legitimate environmental concerns without sacrificing operational viability.

That’s the kind of innovation that deserves attention, not because it’s revolutionary or disruptive or any other marketing buzzword, but because it actually solves problems that matter to people running trucks. It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.

Ford’s 186-mile-range European EV might work fine in the UK, where geography, infrastructure, and operational profiles align with its technology capabilities. It won’t work in American long-haul operations, and removing tax credits that were propping up technology adoption before infrastructure and operations were ready is an acknowledgment of that reality.

What we need isn’t more aggressive mandates or bigger subsidies, it’s better planning, infrastructure investment that matches operational needs, and technology designed around how trucking actually works rather than how regulators wish it worked. The UK did that planning. The US didn’t. Edison Motors did that engineering. Most manufacturers didn’t.

I’m still a diesel guy. I trust what I know works. But I’m also paying attention to what Edison is building because they’re approaching the problem the right way, starting with operational needs and working backward to the technology that addresses them. That’s how practical innovation happens, and it’s proof that EVs can work in trucking if you’re willing to engineer solutions grounded in reality rather than regulatory timelines.

If Edison can make electric hybrids work in logging operations in BC, there’s hope that thoughtful engineering can bridge the gap between diesel reliability and electric efficiency. But it requires listening to what truckers actually need rather than telling them what they should want. The removal of EV tax credits might slow down the rush to electrification. Still, if it creates space for practical solutions like Edison’s hybrid approach to develop and prove themselves, that’s probably a better path forward than subsidizing technology that doesn’t work for how American trucking operates.

Sometimes the best innovations come from the people closest to the problems. Edison Motors getting approval to build electric hybrid heavy-duty trucks in Canada might matter more for trucking’s future than anything Ford or Tesla or any other major manufacturer announces, precisely because Edison was built by truckers who understand what actually works when you’re 100 miles from anywhere and your equipment has to perform or you’re in trouble.

That’s the kind of peace of mind I can respect, even from a diesel guy like me.

Are renewable energy consultants in demand?

There’s strong evidence that demand for renewable energy consultants, along with related roles within the industry, is rising. Here are some examples showing why these professionals are increasingly in demand:

The global market for renewable energy consulting is expected to reach $1.63 billion in 2026.

With the increasing demand for renewable energy professionals worldwide, many companies are facing a skills shortage due to a lower supply of qualified individuals across the globe. This means that there is higher demand for consultants with the relevant skills.

Governments and companies are pushing towards net zero targets and decarbonisation goals, requiring a larger need for consultants to guide the green energy transition.

The renewable energy industry comprises of many different areas such as solar, wind, biomass and other clean technologies, meaning that specialists are required in several different fields.

Renewable energy consulting now makes up more than 30% of the US energy consulting market, highlighting a major shift in the industry, with businesses increasingly looking beyond basic compliance and focusing on meaningful environmental leadership.

What is the salary of a renewable energy consultant?

The salary of a renewable energy consultant varies widely and one of the biggest factors is experience. At the early stages, such as internships, student roles or entry-level energy positions, salaries typically sit around £24,000-£30,000. After graduation, junior or early-career consultants usually move into the £28,000-£38,000 range, with roles in major cities such as London tending to offer salaries at the upper end.

As consultants gain more experience and begin managing their own projects, salaries rise accordingly. Mid-level consultants with roughly 3-8 years of experience commonly earn between £37,000 and £53,000, depending on their technical skills and responsibilities. Senior and principal consultants, who may oversee teams, deliver high-level client advice or manage large portfolios, typically fall in the £45,000-£60,000 bracket, with some extending into the £70,000+ range based on the size of the firm and complexity of the work.

At the top end, consultants who move into director-level positions, specialist expert roles or even consultancy ownership often earn £80,000 and above. However, salaries at every stage are strongly influenced by location, employer type and specialism – London markets, large engineering or energy firms and high-demand niches (such as offshore wind or energy storage) generally command higher pay.

Certifications, technical expertise and the scope of responsibilities also accelerate progression and earning potential within the sector.

Multistate

A multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general succeeded in protecting four federal agencies from elimination by Executive Order. The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted the coalition’s motion for summary judgement, permanently enjoining the dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH).

A multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general announced a suit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in response to new restrictions on Continuum of Care grant programs. Those restrictions will reduce the grant funds available for permanent housing and housing continuity programs. The coalition asserts that HUD’s proposed changes are unlawful because HUD did not engage in the appropriate rulemaking procedures and did not receive congressional approval for the changes.

A multistate coalition of 17 attorneys general filed a comment letter with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) opposing a new rule that would relax the gradual phaseout of HFC use created by the AIM Act. The coalition argued that EPA’s new HFC standards would allow industries to reintroduce an extremely powerful greenhouse gas back into the environment.

A coalition of eight attorneys general entered a settlement with Greystar Management after alleging that Greystar used RealPage’s AI software to raise rent prices in violation of antitrust law. The settlement requires Greystar Management to pay $7 million and stop using any third-party algorithmic pricing models.

California

Attorney General Rob Bonta reached a settlement agreement with Jam City regarding the company’s alleged failure to provide consumers with a method to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. The settlement agreement requires Jam City to pay $1.4 million and prohibits Jam City from selling the personal information of consumers aged 13-16 without their express consent.

Colorado

Attorney General Phil Weiser entered into a settlement agreement with Instawork, an app based staffing agency in Colorado. The Attorney General alleged that Instawork misclassified employees as independent contractors and failed to pay required unemployment insurance premiums. The settlement is the first of its kind under the Colorado False Claims Act.

Michigan

Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a Notice of Intended Action to retail chain Five Below. The Notice alleged that Five Below violated the Michigan Shopping Reform Act and Michigan Consumer Protection Act by overcharging consumers through a consistent practice of mislabeling retail items with prices lower than the actual price charged at the register.

Apparently the new Porsche Cayenne Electric has already set a couple of records for the brand.

It is the most powerful Porsche ever built, and over 10,000 people have already registered their interest to buy one.

But there’s also another ‘record’ that Porsche never mentioned before.

DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie

The one thing Porsche never told us about Cayenne Electric

Porsche has just opened order books for the new Cayenne Electric in the United States and has also launched the online configurator.

According to the German automaker, over 110,000 users made unique builds using the online configurator, which is apparently a record for Porsche.

Furthermore, and let’s face it this is the part that truly matters, a significant percentage of online configurator users are ready to put their money where their online click was, so to speak.

Because they also said 10,500 buyers have registered their interest.

The company added something else that’s interesting, chiefly because it hasn’t exactly been advertised until now.

Apparently, the 1,139-horsepower Cayenne Electric is the most customizable Porsche ever.

The manufacturer never mentioned that before, but this is a bigger deal than people think.

When it comes to luxury vehicles, which is new Porsche Cayenne Electric definitely is, customization is a key selling point.

That’s why customization programs like Mulliner by Bentley and Q by Aston Martin are now as popular as ever.

The EV market keeps sending mixed signals

The EV market is still sending mixed (and inconsistent) signals.

Every time we think we found evidence of one thing, then something that proves the exact opposite happens.

For now, it seems there’s one universal truth: EVs are in demand.

But with a lot of caveats.

One of said caveats is that automakers are struggling to make EVs as profitable as gas cars, and the other is that there are certain segments where EVs don’t really work.

Dodge, for example, is likely doing a 180 on the Charger Daytona and is potentially bringing back an internal combustion version.

But Porsche doesn’t seem to have that problem.

Welcome back from the Thanksgiving holiday (for those of you in the United States). This edition of Projects Weekly highlights RWE’s newly commissioned 200 MW PV + 200 MWh storage Stoneridge Solar project in Texas. Plus, Wisconsin utilities received approval to add solar + storage and other renewables to the state’s energy supply. Additionally, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Tribes) in northeastern Washington and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI) are collaborating to deploy microgrids across the reservation. Finally, a Minnesota school district is switching to solar energy through a partnership with All Energy Solar.

RWE energizes solar + storage project in Texas

RWE has commissioned its Stoneridge Solar project, delivering 200 MW of PV and 100 MW (200 MWh) of battery storage Milam County, Texas.

“Stoneridge Solar is a great example of the power of local partnership and the positive role energy projects play in economic stimulation,” said Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy. “We are helping Texas and the nation secure their energy future with scalable, homegrown energy while also delivering meaningful benefits to communities across America’s heartland.”

Cool factor: Stoneridge Solar created more 200 construction jobs and now supports permanent operational roles. The project is expected to generate millions in tax revenue for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District, with direct investments supporting first responders and educational initiatives. From funding renovations at Thorndale Elementary School to partnering with the local volunteer fire department, RWE is helping communities like Milam County remain resilient and prosperous.

RWE’s energy capacity across the United States has grown to more than 11 GW, reinforcing the company’s leadership in delivering reliable and affordable power to homes and businesses.

MGE adds solar + storage and other renewables to Wisconsin energy supply

Wisconsin utility companies have partnered to add more renewable energy to the state’s energy supply. Madison Gas and Electric (MGE), in partnership with We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS), subsidiaries of WEC Energy Group, received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to purchase solar capacity, battery storage and wind capacity from four renewable energy projects. MGE will own 35 MW of solar, 5 MW of battery storage and nearly 18 MW of wind in total from the different projects.

“The approval of these projects is another important step in our ongoing effort to reduce carbon emissions, increase our use of cost-effective renewable generation and advance new technologies to benefit all customers,” said Jeff Keebler, chairman, president and CEO of MGE. “With our current plans, by 2030, we will have added more than 40 renewable generation and battery storage projects since 2015, totaling more than 750 MW, propelling us toward our goal of net-zero carbon electricity by 2050.”

Cool factor: MGE will own a 10% share of four renewable energy projects, including two solar projects, the Saratoga Solar Energy Center and Ursa Solar Park. The Saratoga Solar Energy Center will include a 150 MW solar array and 50 MW battery energy storage system located in Wood County. MGE will own 15 MW of solar capacity and 5 MW of battery storage. The solar array and battery energy storage system are both expected to start serving customers in 2028. The Ursa Solar Park is a 200 MW solar facility that will be located in Columbia County. MGE will own 20 MW of solar capacity. The solar array is expected to begin serving customers in 2027.

The company will also own shares in two wind farm projects. The Badger Hollow Wind Farm is a 112 MW project in Iowa and Grant counties. MGE will own 11.2 MW of wind capacity. The wind farm is expected to begin serving customers in 2027. The Whitetail Wind Farm is a 67 MW wind farm will be located in Grant County. MGE will own 6.7 MW of wind capacity. The wind farm is expected to begin serving customers in 2027.

Colville Tribes seek energy sovereignty through microgrids

The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Tribes) and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI) announced a landmark collaboration to advance tribal energy sovereignty and resilience through the design and deployment of multiple microgrids across the reservation in northeastern Washington. The program represents a significant step toward improving reliability, reducing outages, and providing long-term energy independence for the Colville Tribes. The initiative is backed by federal and state grant awards and addresses vulnerabilities such as winter storm disruptions and wildfire risks.

OATI is delivering professional project design and development services, hardware, and its advanced GridMind platform to support the microgrids through resource management and market integration. Planned sites include:

Nespelem HQ Campus (Lucy F. Covington Government Center): Rooftop solar PV, battery energy storage, EV charging, and microgrid controls, with an expansion to create a full campus resiliency hub.

Paschal Sherman Indian School (PSIS) Community: Microgrid design to support education and community resiliency.

Keller and Inchelium Districts: Additional distributed energy resources and microgrid infrastructure for local resilience.

Cool factor: The Colville Tribes microgrid program is rooted in the principle of energy sovereignty — the right of tribes to produce, deliver, and manage energy on their own lands. With the Colville Reservation served by multiple utilities offering varied levels of service, the ability to self-generate electricity provides resiliency and reliability for vulnerable communities and ensures critical services, including healthcare, commerce, and housing, remain powered during outages. Colville Tribes may also leverage the microgrids to offer additional grid benefits to local utilities and/or engage in energy markets as they evolve and grow.

“Since the Colville Reservation is in a remote location, subject to natural events like winter storms and fires, it has always been difficult for us to sustain a reliable supply of power,” said Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. “Our hope is that this microgrid technology will not only keep our lights on, but will also position us for new economic opportunities.”

Future expansions envision integration with gaming operations and potential data centers, supported by tribal-owned utility and telecom infrastructure. With multiple microgrids underway, Colville Tribes is establishing itself as a leader in tribal energy innovation. The partnership not only secures reliable power but also positions the tribe for new economic opportunities, including data center hosting and advanced commercial development on tribal lands.

Minnesota school district switches to solar energy with All Energy Solar

Earlier this year, Minneota Public Schools made a powerful move to solar energy for its high school’s electricity needs. All Energy Solar, a leading solar installer in the Midwest headquartered in St Paul, Minnesota, helped the school make that transition with assistance from a state program designed for just this type of project.

“The school’s solar energy system has a capacity of 47.56 kW and consists of 82 panels installed on the gymnasium’s rooftop,” said Les Engler, Minneota facilities manager. “The system has been working very well for the school with the help of All Energy Solar.”

In 2021, the Minnesota State Legislature launched the Solar for Schools grant program for all school districts across the state. This program aims to encourage the installation of solar energy systems for educational institutions, while also providing an opportunity to incorporate renewable energy awareness and instruction into the schools’ curriculum.

Cool factor: Minneota Public Schools, a Kindergarten through 12th grade school district located in southwest Minnesota, is a beacon of academic excellence. With impressive rankings, including No. 17 in the state for State Assessment Proficiency and No. 19 in State Assessment Performance, coupled with a remarkable 100% graduation rate, the school’s commitment to educational excellence is unwavering. Upon learning more about the Solar for Schools program in 2024, Minneota Schools pursued a project as a forward-thinking solution that benefits both the environment and their community.

There are currently three science classes that are incorporating solar energy into their curriculum. Each class utilizes an innovative app that enables them to monitor the new array’s solar inverters and even individual solar panel output. This hands-on experience not only enriches their understanding of renewable energy but also empowers them to engage with real-world technology in a meaningful way.

Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.
But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.","Once every 10 years, ranchers must renew the permits that allow their cattle, sheep and other livestock to graze on the West’s public domain. These renewals are the government’s best opportunity to address how those livestock are harming the environment.

The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, which manage the majority of public lands, are required by law to review each permit before deciding whether to place additional conditions on it or — in rare cases — to deny its renewal.

But in 2014, Congress mandated that the agencies automatically renew permits for another decade if they are unable to complete the reviews. This exemption has dramatically reduced scrutiny of grazing’s impact on public lands.

In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, a ProPublica and High Country News analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about another 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review, the analysis found.

A similar study by the Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.

This diminishing oversight has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of federal employees who complete the reviews. These staffers also conduct land-health assessments of large parcels to help determine whether permits in the area need changes to protect natural resources.

The BLM’s rangeland management staff shrank 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data. President Donald Trump’s administration is further hamstringing the BLM: About 1 in 10 rangeland staffers left the agency between last November’s election and June, according to agency records.

When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted. Such overgrazing can spread invasive plants by dispersing seeds and disturbing the soil, pushing out native species and increasing wildfire risk. When herds strip vegetation near creeks and streams, silt flows into the waterways, wiping out fish nurseries. And, without adequate staff to amend permits, agencies lose the chance to reduce the number of animals on an allotment — and the climate-warming methane they emit.

Once a permit is renewed, with or without a review, it becomes more difficult to rectify such harms for another decade.

Ten current and former BLM rangeland management employees said in interviews that they felt pressure to go easy on ranchers. This included downplaying environmental harm in permit reviews and land-health assessments, according to BLM staffers who worked in rangeland management. Several spoke on condition of anonymity because they still work for the government.

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth,” one BLM employee said of agency oversight.

In a statement, an agency spokesperson said, “The BLM is committed to transparency, sound science, and public participation as it administers grazing permits and considers updates to grazing regulations.”

In a shift, the Trump administration placed the approval process for all the BLM’s contracts and agreements of value in the hands of political appointees rather than career civil servants. In recent months, officials cut funding for an app that assists ranchers in collecting soil and vegetation data for use in permitting, for contractors who manage the data that informs grazing permits, for New Mexico farmers growing seeds used in restoration projects and for soil research in the Southwest, according to BLM records obtained by ProPublica and High Country News.

“Does not believe this action is needed to meet the administration priorities,” the cancellations read.

The Forest Service did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Ranching is often a multi-generation practice that serves to keep working landscapes intact, while also preserving open space, and benefiting recreation, wildlife, and watersheds.”

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth.”

TO GAUGE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SHRINKING OVERSIGHT, ProPublica and High Country News toured federal grazing allotments in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada, finding evidence of either unpermitted grazing or habitat degraded by livestock in each state.In Arizona alone, reporters witnessed such issues in two national conservation areas, a national monument and a national forest.

On an allotment within Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, an expanse of desert grasslands and forested streams southeast of Tucson, the BLM lets up to 1,500 head of cattle graze across roughly 35,000 acres. These permits were recently reauthorized until 2035 using the exemption that allows environmental reviews to be skipped.

During a visit in late April, a grove of hearty cottonwoods stood against the afternoon sun, casting cool shadows over a narrow creek. This stretch of green sustains birds, frogs, snakes and ocelots. It’s also designated under federal law as critical habitat for five threatened or endangered species. Cattle are not allowed in the creekbed, but a thin barbed-wire fence meant to stop the animals lay crumpled in the dirt.

A native leopard frog broke the hot afternoon stillness as it leapt from the creek’s bank. Its launching pad was the hardened mud imprint of a cow hoof, and it landed with a plop in water fouled by cow feces and the partially submerged bones of a cow corpse. A half-dozen cattle crashed through the creek and up the steep embankment, tearing up plants that protected the soil from erosion and sending silt billowing into the water.

“Looks like a sewer,” Chris Bugbee, a wildlife ecologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, remarked as he took in the destruction. “This one hurts. There is no excuse.”

A 2024 BLM land-health assessment listed the grazing allotment as “ALL STANDARDS MET.” In April, a camouflaged trail camera bearing the agency’s insignia was pointed toward the creek. (ProPublica and High Country News submitted a public records request for images on the camera’s memory card in May, but the BLM has yet to fulfill the request.)

No ranchers paid to graze their livestock in this allotment last year, according to BLM data, so it is unclear who owned the cattle. The Arizona Cattle Growers’ Association, which represents ranchers in the state, did not respond to requests for comment.

Each year for the past eight years, Bugbee and his team have surveyed grazing impacts on the banks of streams and rivers in the Southwest that are designated as critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.

The industry maintains that the presence of livestock benefits many ecosystems, pointing to studies that have found, for example, that grazing can increase soil’s ability to hold carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to climate change. Other research suggests that, when managed properly, grazing can improve habitat health and allow it to support a more diverse mix of species.

Grazing also reduces vegetation that could fuel wildfires. Frank Shirts Jr., owner of the largest sheep operation on Forest Service land, said that sheep eat invasive weeds and brush, creating firebreaks. “These animals are fantastic,” he said.

Retta Bruegger, a range ecologist at Colorado State University, said that some ecosystems, especially those that receive more precipitation, can withstand more intense grazing. In regions where plants evolved over many years alongside large grazers like cattle, livestock can “provide a very important ecosystem function.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’” said Bruegger.

But answering those questions, she said, would require adequate staff to monitor the land.

AFTER A CENTURY OF INTENSE GRAZING WORE DOWN the public lands, a court ruled in 1974 that grazing permits were subject to environmental reviews, and Congress passed a law two years later mandating reviews every decade.

For years, a backlog of permit reviews grew, as federal land-management agencies lacked the staff to inspect all their territory — 240 million acres across BLM and Forest Service jurisdictions. Around 2000, Congress began giving temporary approval for regulators to skip reviews. Western Republicans, with the livestock industry’s support, pushed to enshrine the concept in law. The idea ultimately received bipartisan approval in December 2014, after being slipped into a must-pass defense spending bill.

Some conservationists now call it simply “the loophole.”

Many in the livestock industry lambaste the lack of reviews. When permits are automatically renewed, the law does not allow the terms to change, so ranchers are prevented from updating their grazing practices.

“It just locks people into grazing the same place, the same time, year after year,” said Chris Jasmine, manager of biodiversity and rangelands for Nevada Gold Mines, which owns 11 ranches in northern Nevada.

To help inform permit renewals, teams of BLM experts — rangeland specialists, hydrologists, botanists, soil scientists and wildlife biologists — assess the health of grazing allotments.

When the process is working as intended, these assessments are considered in permit reviews. But the current lack of staff has left large swaths of land without scrutiny.

All told, the BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands available for grazing. But the agency has no record of completing land-health assessments for more than 35 million acres, nearly a quarter of its total.

Where the BLM has conducted such assessments, it found grazing had degraded due to livestock, at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. And close to two-thirds of the land it listed as being in good shape had not been checked in more than a decade, the analysis found.

The situation, though, is even worse than these numbers indicate, as the agency has often skipped permit reviews on land in poor condition. Of the acreage the BLM had previously found to be degraded due to livestock, 82% was reauthorized for grazing without a review, according to ProPublica and High Country News’ analysis.

Several BLM employees said agency higher-ups instruct staff to study land that’s in better condition while avoiding allotments that are in worse shape or more controversial. Environmental groups such as the Western Watersheds Project as well as local stockmen’s associations are quick to litigate changes to permits. Automatic renewals avoid these drawn-out public fights. “We were just using a bureaucratic loophole,” one staffer said. “We were allowing ongoing degradation of habitat.”

“This can’t be the future of public lands,” Bugbee, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said of parcels degraded by cattle, likening the land to a “mowed lawn.”

Agency staff pointed to myriad reasons why the environment is suffering.

For example, after a wildfire, the BLM aims to keep livestock off the land for two years to allow the ecosystem to recover. But ranchers often negotiate an earlier return to the public pastures where their livestock graze, said Steve Ellis, who spent his career with the BLM and Forest Service, rising to high-level positions in both.

“There was always pressure to get back on,” Ellis said. “That’s not a new thing. It’s just part of working for the bureau.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’”

The government’s support for ranchers can add to the damage. Land-management agencies sometimes seed invasive grasses, which can benefit livestock. And state and federal agencies kill predators such as wolves and cougars — integral to healthy ecosystems — to protect ranchers’ economic interests.

BLM employees also said that in some permit reviews and land-health assessments, rank-and-file staff noted the presence of threatened and endangered species, which would have triggered tighter environmental controls, only for agency managers to delete that information from their reports.

One BLM staffer called the reviews “rubber stamping” and said higher-ranking staff who controlled the text of reports “wouldn’t let me stick anything into the official documentation that acknowledged things were in poor shape.”

Another complicating factor, according to BLM staff, is that ranchers are often invited to participate in fieldwork to gauge whether they are overgrazing. The result, employees said, was watered-down reviews and assessments.

The industry, though, is critical of the assessment process for other reasons. Erin Spaur, executive vice president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said it’s an inflexible “one-size-fits-all approach” that doesn’t sufficiently account for differences in ecosystems.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency,” said Dennis Willis, who spent more than three decades with the BLM, including managing rangeland, adding that “there’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

SOME RANCHERS ACKNOWLEDGE THE ENVIRONMENTAL impacts of their industry. But they say that more flexibility — not stricter oversight — would make them better stewards of the land.

Jasmine, with Nevada Gold Mines, contends that ranching can be done without denuding the West. A sixth-generation Nevadan, he oversees the mining company’s ranching operations, which run about 5,000 head of cattle.

On a sunny July day near Carlin, Nevada, Jasmine walked through chest-high vegetation to show off the recovery of Maggie Creek, a tributary to the Humboldt River that flows through a checkerboard of public and private lands. Photographs from the 1980s show barren ground around the shallow creek. When ranchers changed how they rotated their herds in the 1990s to give the streambed more rest, the land bounced back, Jasmine said. He credited a BLM biologist with initiating many of the projects that helped revive Maggie Creek.

“It’s a renewable resource. That grass that they’re eating right now will come back next year and the year after that if managed properly,” he said. “It’s about not eating the same plants in the same place year after year after year.”

Jasmine touted the company’s goal of protecting locally important species, its sage grouse restoration projects and its partnership with the BLM, which targeted grazing to remove unwanted vegetation and create a firebreak.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency. There’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

But Nevada Gold Mines — a joint venture between two companies with a combined value of around $150 billion — operates in a different economic reality than most ranchers and can afford to keep cattle off the land long enough for it to recover.

Smaller ranchers face slim profit margins, making it attractive to heavily graze federal lands, where the cost is much lower than on state or private land.

For years, some politicians and environmental groups have proposed protecting degraded or sensitive habitats by paying ranchers to retire their permits, making the areas off-limits to grazing and preserving the land as wildlife habitat. Ranchers have occasionally taken these offers. But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.

In October, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, introduced a bill to further voluntary retirement, calling it “a pragmatic solution that supports local economies, protects biodiversity, and saves taxpayer dollars by reducing the cost of administering grazing programs.”

Louis Wertz, a spokesperson for the Western Landowners Alliance, said that the conservation-minded ranchers who make up his group want to both stay in business and “live in a place that is vibrant, full of life, provides clean water, has clean air.” But when it comes to food production, he added, “the expectations we have of both being environmentally harmless and healthy and cheap are untenable. Over the last 150 years in the United States, we have chosen cheapness at the expense of environmental quality.”

Like Jasmine, Wertz said that understaffing at the BLM and Forest Service deprives ranchers of an opportunity to change how they manage their herds, even when they want to.

“It is important that there be accountability for producers on the landscape,” Wertz said, but there should also be “flexibility so producers can be economically successful and so they can do what is right for the landscape.”

For decades, beef producers have relied on visible performance indicators such as body condition, weight gain, and reproductive success. Yet, one of the biggest drivers of profitability has remained hidden: individual animal methane emissions and what they reveal about feed efficiency.

Agscent Air is changing that. The technology provides real-time, on-farm methane measurement that enables producers to identify their most efficient animals, validate management interventions, and build more profitable, low-emission herds.

At Macka’s Black Angus Beef, producer Robert Mackenzie is proving that methane monitoring is more than an environmental compliance exercise – it is a productivity tool that delivers results directly to the bottom line.

The feed efficiency connection

Methane emissions and feed efficiency are closely linked. Cattle with lower residual feed intake (RFI), a measure of how efficiently an animal uses feed for growth or production, produce 15–25% less methane than their less efficient counterparts.1,2

This is not a coincidence. Methane represents lost feed energy – so animals that emit less methane convert more nutrients into growth. The performance and cost implications are significant.

Cattle with a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 5.4:1 are more efficient — this means they need 5.4 kg of feed to gain 1 kg of body weight. These efficient cattle cost about AUD $115 less to finish and reach market 26 days sooner, saving an extra AUD $143 per head. In dairy systems, efficient cows can also save around AUD $675 per year in feed costs.

The implications extend throughout the operation. As Robert Mackenzie explained, “You eat less, you produce less methane.” This simple principle translates to “better feed conversion, which means lower costs, reduced pasture pressure, faster growth, and improved margins.”

The challenge lies in identifying which animals possess these valuable traits – and that is where methane monitoring becomes essential.

Making measurement practical

So how can producers access this critical data without disrupting their operations? Until recently, accurately measuring livestock methane required expensive respiration chambers or specialist research facilities. Agscent’s technology eliminates those barriers. The Agscent Air GHG systems use portable, sensor-based monitoring that integrates naturally into existing farm infrastructure, providing data on:

• Individual animal methane output

Variation across the herd

Response to feed and management changes

Genetic differences in efficiency

Macka’s Beef has been using the Agscent X Optiweigh system to validate a mineral supplement programme. “We developed a baseline with Himalayan rock salt and we got the animal to go into the Optiweigh X Agscent machine,” Mackenzie explained. The system is measuring methane output before and after introducing his ECO2 Feed mineral supplement. With reliable measurement now possible, the question becomes: what can producers actually do with this data?

Beyond compliance: Data that drives profitability

While sustainability credentials and carbon credits add value, Mackenzie sees the real payoff in productivity insights. Methane data helps producers:

• Identify superior genetics within herds

• Validate feed additives and dietary programmes

• Evaluate pasture species and management decisions

By 2026, Macka’s Black Angus plans to integrate methane measurement into its breeding programme, using verified data to select stud bulls and cows that combine genetic strength with environmental efficiency.

This genetic information has immediate commercial value – enhancing breeding decisions, marketing efficiency-verified genetics, and building long-term herd improvement strategies.

The measurement journey

For producers beginning their methane monitoring journey, Mackenzie recommends starting with the basics:

1. Establish baselines using carbon calculators and existing data

2. Identify priorities for emissions and efficiency improvement

3. Implement measurement with technology partners like Agscent

4. Test interventions such as feed additives or genetic selection

5. Refine and scale successful practices across the herd

Competitive advantage and the future of sustainable beef

Building on this foundation of measurement and improvement, early adopters are positioning themselves for a changing market landscape. As consumer demand for sustainable beef continues to rise and carbon accounting becomes standard, verified low-methane systems will offer a strong competitive edge.

Producers adopting these technologies early gain the ability to:

• Optimise operations before regulation mandates it

• Build premium, data-backed market positions

• Access carbon credit revenue streams

• Operate using insights other producers lack

“Sustainability means leaving the land better than we found it,” Mackenzie said. “But it’s also becoming a licence to produce – we’ll be required to become more sustainable whether we like it or not.”

The bottom line

Macka’s Black Angus Beef experience shows that the technologies reducing emissions are the same ones driving profitability. Methane measurement enables smarter decisions – whether through identifying efficient genetics, validating feed strategies, or refining herd composition.

“You can’t manage what you don’t measure,” Mackenzie concluded. His operation proves the point: methane measurement isn’t just about emissions compliance – it’s about unlocking hidden productivity potential that’s always been there.

The question for beef producers isn’t whether to measure methane. It’s whether they can afford to keep making breeding, feeding, and management decisions without understanding this critical dimension of herd performance. As sustainability requirements tighten and competition intensifies, the answer becomes increasingly clear.

The nickel market in India is expected to grow rapidly, with projections estimated to exceed $33 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.8%. Nickel is a crucial element in stainless steel manufacturing, as it enhances its corrosion resistance and durability, properties vital for infrastructure, construction, chemical processing, and marine applications. Simultaneously, nickel is indispensable in battery manufacturing, especially for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs), with its high energy density critical for improving battery life and efficiency.

India’s renewable energy targets — aiming for 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 — and accelerated EV adoption are driving unprecedented demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements. Lithium demand alone is projected to increase tenfold by 2030, while copper demand is expected to more than double, highlighting the mineral-rich future ahead for India’s energy transition and industrial modernisation.

Bridging the demand-supply gap:

Despite the promising projections, India produces only a minimal amount of domestic nickel. The country sources most of its nickel from foreign suppliers, including Norway, Japan, Canada, Indonesia, and China. This import dependency exposes the Indian players to risks of global price volatility, geopolitical tensions, a new coalition of countries, and supply chain disruptions. For example, fluctuations in nickel prices or interruptions in supply can increase costs for battery manufacturers, potentially slowing EV production and undermining India’s clean energy transition plans. The projected nickel demand for EV batteries is expected to surge by more than 600% by 2040, intensifying the urgency to secure stable supplies.

The stainless-steel industry in India, which consumes roughly 70% of domestically available nickel, also faces pressures from unstable import prices. These cost fluctuations can negatively impact the competitiveness of Indian stainless-steel products both in domestic and global markets, making it harder for manufacturers to plan and price their goods efficiently. Moreover, environmental regulations and sustainability concerns tied to nickel mining and refining, and its overwhelming control by China, add to the complexity of securing reliable, ethically produced nickel supplies.

To address these multifaceted challenges, the Indian government launched the National Critical Minerals Mission (NCMM) in 2025. This program represents a cornerstone effort to increase domestic exploration and production of critical minerals like nickel. More than Rs 34,000 crore of investments through 2031 is expected to boost exploration, downstream processing, and mineral recycling capacities (targeting 270 kilotonnes annually). (4) The mission also seeks to establish technology hubs and Centres of Excellence to foster innovation and development in the sector. To complement domestic production growth, the government is also striving to diversify international sources to mitigate geopolitical risks and ensure continuous supply chains.

Strategic initiatives:

Recent strategic industry moves further underscore efforts to decrease import reliance. After Vedanta Nico acquired Nicomet in 2021, the company entered into a strategic memorandum of understanding (MoU) with AEsir in 2024 to become the preferred supplier of nickel, a vital raw material for AEsir’s advanced battery technology. This collaboration builds on a broader partnership where Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta’s sister company and a leading zinc producer, supports the supply of zinc for these nickel-zinc batteries.

Meanwhile, Odisha is recognised for its substantial nickel reserves estimated at around 175 million tons–Jaipur (140 million tonnes), Mayurbhanj (27 million tonnes), and Keonjhar (8 million tonnes) — positioning it as a key state for future nickel mining and processing growth.

Despite these proactive steps, India’s heavy dependency on nickel imports remains a primary challenge. India imported nearly $1.26 billion during 2024, according to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade. Unpredictable pricing, supply security concerns, and the need to comply with ascending environmental standards threaten to slow India’s industrial growth trajectory and delay its ambitious renewable energy and technology modernization goals.

The way forward

As India accelerates its journey towards a sustainable and self-reliant clean future, it will call for a comprehensive and forward-looking policy framework focused on the entire mineral lifecycle. And Vedanta Nico will play a critical role by ensuring a steady, high-quality supply of nickel—an essential metal for advanced battery technologies and green infrastructure, turning the challenges of global supply uncertainties into sustainable opportunities for national progress.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nickel.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:51.684230

It’s exactly what President Donald Trump’s administration said it was going to do: shrink the agency’s scientific research apparatus. It’s also an outcome that could come back to bite the EPA in times of crisis, departing researchers say.

NOTUS identified 16 researchers, all with doctoral or master’s degrees, many of them experts in using machine learning to speed up the identification and analysis of toxic chemicals, who have left the EPA for the private lab UL Research Institutes.

Most of these scientists worked for the EPA’s much-vaunted Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, tasked with developing ways to quickly figure out chemical toxicity.

This was a team that advised crews dispatched to East Palestine, Ohio, where a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in 2023, causing massive environmental damage. One of the departing researchers said that the center had an “on call” scientist for the field teams in East Palestine.

The EPA has said that the agency should only be conducting research that is required by law for it to fulfill its duties. The agency has eliminated its Office of Research and Development, or ORD, and reassigned scientists to other offices focused on regulatory responsibilities.

“The unfortunate reality is that the work many people in ORD were doing was disconnected from our statutory obligations,” the agency said in response to NOTUS’ questions about the loss of the EPA researchers.

Departing scientists say that misses the impact of their work. The team of computational scientists was useful in the immediate aftermath of the East Palestine disaster because it had the tools to very quickly generate safety and toxicity data. The research at the Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure was intended to inform regulatory decision-making “more quickly after a chemical is discovered in the environment,” a former EPA researcher who went to UL said.

UL Research Institutes, a Georgia-based nonprofit lab, is in the process of expanding into a new chemical insights lab in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park — the same place where the EPA’s largest office in the country is located, and where most of these researchers worked previously. It has been hiring almost exclusively former EPA scientists for the last several months, according to a review of their new hire announcements.

The lab is part of a “strategic expansion” intended to “provide additional access to top-tier talent,” a UL spokesperson told NOTUS.

Still, losing the center and so many of its researchers to the private sector may make it harder for the EPA to respond quickly to chemical events, the former EPA researcher at UL said.

Their team at the EPA didn’t just respond to emergencies; it also responded in the immediate aftermath of the discovery of a new mysterious chemical in the environment — like when GenX, an unregulated PFAS chemical, was discovered in the drinking water in eastern North Carolina in 2017, the same researcher said.

Advocates for public research say the public is less likely to benefit from private sector endeavors, no matter how good a lab’s intentions are.

“There’s not as much power, if you will, for research coming from a private lab or an NGO, because the government is the final decider,” said Kyla Bennett, the science policy director at the advocacy organization Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “When EPA does a draft risk assessment and they accept comments, they can and do ignore comments from academia, from NGOs and from private institutions.”

The Trump administration rejects these concerns.

“EPA has the resources it needs and remains well-equipped to respond to emergencies,” an agency spokesperson said. “We have excellent staff throughout the agency who will ensure that this type of science and research supporting our statutory responsibilities continues, and baseless gossip claiming otherwise should not be the source of your reporting.”

For the federal government’s top environmental and chemical researchers, the writing has been on the wall since June, when the EPA announced it would be closing down its independent scientific research arm.

The Trump administration has embraced the privatization of scientific research and pushed to move research out of the federal government wherever possible. The president’s chief science adviser has said that the private sector should take over funding more science, and the government should be doing “basic” research that serves the national interest.

The EPA shut its independent research office — which was its largest arm until now — and began to hand out reassignments to its scientists in September. Many researchers chose to leave the federal government rather than abandon their work.

“What we’re seeing is a drive to fundamentally change what is the role of the federal government in the U.S. and push to no longer have the federal government cover certain functions,” said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who was the deputy administrator in charge of the Office of Research and Development during the Biden administration and spent 40 years at the EPA.

The EPA continues to insist that, despite the elimination of an independent research arm, it still plans to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” according to its announcement about the shuttering of ORD.

The 16 researchers identified by NOTUS who left the EPA for the private sector were on the cutting edge of their field.

“ORD was the focal point for that, nationally,” said Thomas Burke, a former EPA assistant administrator for ORD during President Barack Obama’s administration. “We’ve lost that, as a resource to the scientific community.”

One of the researchers, Russell Thomas, who led the Center for Computational Toxicology in Exposure, won the American Medical Association’s award for outstanding government service in 2024, for transforming how the health impacts of chemicals are evaluated.

“In the past, using animal testing to evaluate chemicals for endocrine disruption, EPA was only able to evaluate about 70 chemicals over 25 years, at a cost of approximately $1 million per chemical. By contrast, using approaches developed by Thomas’s team, over 2,000 chemicals were evaluated in three years for a cost of just $30,000 per chemical,” the American Medical Association wrote in 2024.

Thomas declined to comment for this story.

NOTUS found that at least four of the 16 researchers now employed by UL were hired or paid under EPA’s Title 42 program, which was designed to incentivize the world’s top researchers to work for the government instead of the private sector.

Although the full list of scientists hired until the Title 42 program is not public, NOTUS also identified at least three other researchers hired under that program who left the EPA in the last three months to work in the private sector.

“We just destroyed the top leadership, we lost the best and the brightest of the emerging stars, and they cut off the pipeline for the future,” Burke said. Last year, Burke, who now works as a professor at Johns Hopkins University, produced a congressionally required report on the benefits of the EPA’s Title 42 program that detailed the groundbreaking scientific talent the agency attracted through the program.

Many of the researchers now working for UL hope that they will be able to continue doing the work they were doing at EPA. UL is investing heavily in expanding its chemical safety research.

“I’m happy they were able to find a job and to be able to do the work that they were trained to do,” said Orme-Zavaleta. “But the bottom line is, who benefits now from this work? The American public is no longer the direct beneficiary.”

AI has been accelerating sustainability and energy goals particularly well over the last few years.

Now, in an effort to prioritise this area, Google has introduced its self-service Energy Assessment Tool (EAT) to help manufacturers improve efficiency while reducing both operational costs and emissions.

The EAT platform is designed to give facility managers the ability to perform preliminary energy assessments without requiring specialist expertise or expensive on-site support.

The primary function of the EAT is to lower the barriers to entry for energy efficiency projects. While manufacturers can realise considerable cost savings and emissions cuts through such improvements, many are hindered by challenges.

These can include the high cost of engaging energy assessment consultants, limited capital for new projects and a lack of in-house energy management knowledge. Such obstacles often mean that straightforward high-impact projects are not implemented.

Breaking down barriers with a self-service energy tool

To address these challenges, Google has developed EAT as a free platform for manufacturing facility and plant managers. It aims to identify energy-saving opportunities and accelerate progress on cost reduction and climate action initiatives.

The tool delivers actionable insights without demanding prior energy management expertise from the user. By inputting basic facility data, users can generate customised recommendations that cover more than 20 system areas, including air compressors, boilers, chillers and lighting.

Kate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) at Google, explained the motivation behind the project on LinkedIn.

“We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader,” she writes.

The tool is intended to foster collaboration and extend positive impacts throughout the value chain. It highlights projects with the highest potential for cost and carbon reduction and enables assessment across multiple facilities to help prioritise investment.

Data-driven audits and collaborative supply chains

Google’s objective with the EAT is to provide an accessible data-driven method for identifying potential energy efficiency projects. The platform offers analyses that are typically found in an ""ASHRAE Level 1"" standard energy audit.

The tool’s calculation methodology and comprehensive data were developed by engineering consulting firms, transforming what is often a complex and costly process into a simple and collaborative solution.

To support its adoption in key manufacturing regions, the platform is available in Chinese (simplified and traditional), Thai, Vietnamese and English.

Data security and confidentiality are key considerations. The EAT is built and managed by a third-party organisation and has been reviewed by Google to ensure it meets strict privacy and security standards.

Individual supplier data remains secure and suppliers retain control over which partners they collaborate with and what summary data, such as total potential savings, they choose to share.

Integrating EAT into Google’s wider sustainability strategy

This initiative is part of Google’s broader strategy for sustainable energy use across its operations and supply chain. Google, which is one of the world's largest corporate buyers of clean energy, is also investing in advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal and grid-enhancing technologies.

In 2020, Google announced its goal to achieve net zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030, supported by an ambition to operate entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy.

Google's own data centres are designed for high efficiency, with its AI chips becoming more power-efficient over time.

Google also focuses on designing out waste, boosting material reuse and pursuing a more sustainable supply chain. This new tool extends that ethos to its partners.

“The journey to a more sustainable future is a shared one,” Google writes.

German-backed solar factory could shift Ghana from importer to regional producer, anchoring a new industrial base for West Africa’s green economy.

Renewables expand across Africa, but Ghana’s gains remain incremental; governance, tariffs and utility finances will determine the pace of real impact.

Ghana is moving closer to a modest but symbolically important milestone in its transition toward cleaner energy, with roughly 111 GWh of additional solar-based electricity expected by 2026. The projection, drawn from a recent African Development Bank (AfDB) implementation report, stems from the ongoing Ghana Mini Grid and Solar PV Net Metering Project, a US$85 million investment designed to expand rural electrification and reduce the country’s dependence on hydro and thermal generation.

Although the initiative will not significantly alter the national power balance, it represents a calculated effort to ease pressure on a sector long constrained by fuel-price exposure, liquidity stress among state-owned utilities, and the political sensitivity surrounding consumer tariffs.

Ghana’s electricity landscape continues to grapple with structural weaknesses that undermine performance and investor confidence. Chronic cash flow imbalances at the Electricity Company of Ghana, along with the persistent gap between cost-recovery requirements and politically driven tariff decisions, limit utilities' ability to invest sustainably. Technical losses remain high, and the system’s dependence on imported fuel exposes the economy to international market volatility. With electricity demand rising steadily—often by more than 4% per year—the government’s ambition to achieve universal access by 2030 has heightened the urgency to diversify supply sources and strengthen network resilience. Renewables, excluding hydro, currently account for less than 1% of Ghana’s generation mix, leaving the country behind frontrunners such as Kenya and South Africa.

Within this context, the AfDB-backed programme seeks to accelerate supply diversification. It foresees installing 67.8 MW of new solar generation capacity through the deployment of 35 mini-grids targeting lakeside and island communities, as well as 12,000 rooftop systems for households, small businesses, and public facilities. The Bank’s November 2025 review rates progress as satisfactory, though the project faces delays linked to slow tax-exemption approvals and the late release of government counterpart financing.

As of late 2025, only 12.6% of funds had been disbursed. Nevertheless, once completed, the initiative could provide reliable power to more than 84,000 people, generate nearly 3,000 temporary jobs, and reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 718,000 tonnes annually. It also fits within a continental trend that increasingly views mini-grids as an efficient mechanism for electrifying remote areas.

The solar programme also exposes Ghana’s vulnerability to imported components and underdeveloped maintenance ecosystems, both of which risk limiting the long-term viability of off-grid assets. This challenge underscores the importance of an industrial shift that is already taking shape. In late 2025, Germany’s development bank KfW launched an international tender for a solar module assembly facility in Kumasi, with an annual production capacity of 75 MW.

If delivered on schedule between 2026 and 2027, the plant would become the first of its kind in West Africa and anchor Ghana’s emerging green industrialisation strategy. It would also provide a platform for technology transfer, reduce dependence on Asian imports, and position Ghana as a potential supplier to ECOWAS markets. The industrial momentum coincides with a growing pipeline of domestic solar projects, including the 200 MW Norbert Anku Solar Park—expandable to 1 GW by 2032—which signals the country’s intention to strengthen its competitive position in the regional energy landscape.

Ghana’s progress mirrors a broader continental acceleration in renewable energy initiatives. Nigeria is expanding its portfolio of solar mini-grids as part of a clean-energy investment pipeline estimated at US$7.8 billion. Kenya remains a regional leader with more than 400 operational mini-grids and the continent’s largest wind installation at Lake Turkana. Angola is rolling out a 724 MW solar programme supported by Western partners, and Morocco continues to consolidate its large-scale solar and CSP infrastructure with an eye toward future exports to Europe. Africa as a whole could exceed 100 GW of installed solar capacity by 2030, up from roughly 10 GW today, provided that financing flows stabilise and supply-chain bottlenecks ease.

In the medium term, Ghana’s additional 111 GWh of annual renewable output will support incremental improvements in energy access and help reduce the carbon intensity of marginal supply. The more strategic development lies in the emergence of a local solar manufacturing base, which—if KfW’s initiative succeeds—could fundamentally shift Ghana’s role within West Africa’s clean-energy ecosystem.

Yet this outcome is far from guaranteed. The public sector will need to improve procurement efficiency, stabilise utilities' financial health, and implement more predictable tariff reforms to attract private investors. Sustaining off-grid systems will also require stronger operation and maintenance frameworks than those typically observed across the region.

For now, Ghana’s renewable expansion remains gradual rather than transformative. However, if industrial plans materialise as intended, the country could evolve into a regional hub for solar technologies, strengthening its competitiveness and reducing long-term energy vulnerability. The following two years, marked by the roll-out of the AfDB-supported systems and the potential commissioning of the German-backed plant, will be decisive in determining whether Ghana can convert momentum into a durable structural advantage.

United States Renewable Energy Industry Overview

In just over a decade, the renewable energy industry has shifted from a niche market to a core pillar of America’s energy infrastructure. Today, renewables—spanning solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and bioenergy—are central to both public and private decarbonization strategies. Businesses across the value chain are fueling growth, including utilities, battery manufacturers, investors, engineering firms, and technology developers.

A powerful mix of incentives—like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Production Tax Credit (PTC), and state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards—has transformed renewables from expensive to economically superior options. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of the most significant clean energy laws in U.S. history, further boosts investor confidence by promising long-term tax stability and encouraging domestic manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, and wind components.

As solar module improvements, advanced wind turbine designs, and utility-scale storage become more cost-efficient, renewables increasingly compete with, and in many cases, outperform fossil fuel generation. Smart grid technologies and AI-driven energy optimization are improving system reliability, while large infrastructure investments—particularly in offshore wind and utility-scale solar—have pushed renewable capacity to record highs.

Solar is experiencing an extraordinary boom. All market segments—utility-scale, commercial, and residential—continue to expand, resulting in 188 GW of total installed solar capacity nationwide. In 2023 alone, 22.5 GW of new utility-scale solar was added, while nearly 800,000 residential customers installed solar systems on their rooftops. The country plans to add an average of 30 GW of solar annually by 2025, and 60 GW each year from 2025 to 2030. By 2034, cumulative solar capacity is expected to hit 673 GW, enough to power more than 100 million U.S. households.

A landmark example of America’s transition is the Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, launched by Terra-Gen and Mortenson in 2024. Spanning 4,600 acres, it features:

1.9 million First Solar panels

875 MWdc solar capacity

3.3 GWh energy storage

1.3 GW interconnection capacity—the largest in the United States

These mega-projects illustrate the scale and sophistication of renewable energy deployment in the country.

Key Factors Driving United States Renewable Energy Market Growth

1. Strong Policy Support and Regulatory Incentives

Public policy remains one of the strongest drivers of renewable energy adoption in the U.S. Federal incentives like the ITC, PTC, and extensive tax credits under the IRA reduce upfront costs and improve project viability. State-level support through Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), clean energy mandates, and net-metering programs reinforces momentum at the local level.

In addition to cutting costs, these incentives enhance long-term revenue certainty—critical for attracting large-scale private investment. States including California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey have enacted aggressive clean energy laws tied to emissions targets, further stimulating deployment.

2. Technological Innovation and Cost Declines

The rapid decline in the cost of solar PV systems, wind turbines, and battery storage is speeding up adoption. Improved materials, automated manufacturing, enhanced turbine aerodynamics, bifacial solar modules, and higher-capacity batteries have reduced the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewables to historic lows.

Advanced grid modernization tools—including AI-powered forecasting, virtual power plants (VPPs), real-time monitoring, and energy management software—are strengthening system integration. Economies of scale continue to push renewable energy prices down, making them competitive with natural gas and coal in most regions.

3. Rising Corporate and Consumer Demand for Clean Energy

Corporations are now among the largest purchasers of renewable energy. Major companies are signing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), investing in on-site generation, and pursuing net-zero targets. This corporate demand offers reliable revenue streams for developers, accelerating project financing.

Residential customers are adopting rooftop solar and community solar programs at unprecedented rates. Motivations range from cost savings and energy independence to environmental concerns, strengthened by financial incentives and falling equipment costs.

Challenges Facing the United States Renewable Energy Market

1. Grid Infrastructure Limitations

Despite rapid renewable expansion, America’s aging grid remains one of the biggest bottlenecks. Solar and wind intermittency, transmission congestion, lengthy interconnection queues, and permitting hurdles slow down deployment.

Large-scale renewables require robust transmission systems, yet many proposed lines face delays of 5–10 years due to regulatory, land-use, and stakeholder issues. Without significant upgrades in transmission and storage, renewable growth may outpace grid capacity.

2. Complex and Lengthy Permitting Processes

Permitting complexity—especially for utility-scale solar, offshore wind, and interstate transmission—can significantly delay projects. Environmental reviews, zoning regulations, and overlapping state and federal jurisdictions often lead to unpredictable timelines.

Land-use disputes and community opposition add further complications. Developers frequently cite permitting uncertainty as a top investment risk. Simplifying and standardizing regulations could unlock billions in clean energy investment.

United States Renewable Energy Market Overview by States

The U.S. renewable market is far from uniform. Regional variations in policy, geography, consumer engagement, and resource availability help shape state-level performance. Three major states illustrate the spectrum of clean energy activity:

California: America’s Renewable Energy Epicenter

California remains the country's undisputed leader in renewable energy adoption. Abundant sunlight, ambitious climate policies, and an engaged consumer base drive strong growth across residential and utility-scale solar, geothermal, and bioenergy.

Final Thoughts

The United States is standing at the threshold of its most transformative clean energy decade yet. With renewable capacity expected to surpass 1,000 GW by 2033, the next few years will redefine the country’s energy, economic, and environmental trajectory. Strong federal and state support, a rapidly maturing technology ecosystem, and surging corporate sustainability commitments are powering the nationwide pivot toward green energy.

Yet the transition is not without obstacles. Grid congestion, slow permitting, and aging infrastructure all present formidable challenges. But with ongoing investments in storage, transmission, and innovation, the fundamentals of the U.S. renewable energy market remain exceptionally strong.

As global competition intensifies and climate pressures escalate, America’s commitment to renewable energy will not only determine its environmental future—but also shape its economic leadership in the decades ahead.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/692e877cce0795001da2071b.png",N,,2025-12-02 07:58:25.454616

Lead poisoning is serious -- there's a reason leaded gasoline is mostly gone from the market.
These companies sometimes buy recycled lead from global trading companies who buy the lead from recyclers all over the globe.
“We do not have extra resources to be involved in the overseas project for recycling lead batteries,” Mr. Tabo wrote.
Japan, for example, has imported recycled lead from Nigeria in the past decade, trade records show.","A couple of weeks ago we brought you this New York Times report about lead poisoning being caused by factories that produce batteries for automotive use.

These factories are/were producing batteries such as the 12-volt units used for starting your car, and not necessarily the large batteries for electric vehicles.

Near the end of the post, I wrote that it wasn't clear how much automakers knew:

The Times reports that automakers often claim to be using clean recycling processes, even marketing their processes as clean and safe. In reality, at least some of the recycled lead is being sourced from factories that are polluting. Perhaps the OEMs are aware of the dirty conditions at these facilities -- and perhaps they are not. After all, the supply chain is complex and as the Times points out in the piece, it's possible, even likely, that automakers and battery producers don't know where the lead is coming from.

Now the NYT reports that automakers definitely knew -- and have known for a long time.

The outlet leads with the story of an Australian lawyer meeting with Ford executives at the Blue Oval's Dearborn HQ in 2005. The lawyer, Philip Toyne, warned those executives that recycled lead from car batteries was poisoning people, because the factories that did the recycling were putting toxic smoke out into the atmosphere.

He even pitched a program in which inspectors would certify factories as clean, and automakers -- and suppliers who manufactured batteries -- could buy recycled lead only from companies that passed certification. That would allow the companies to claim, in their marketing, that they used only lead that was recycled cleanly.

According to the Times, records and interviews show that OEMs have known for 30 years or more that the factories they purchased recycled lead from were polluting the atmosphere. But they did nothing, and even blocked efforts to address the problem. When the big automakers wrote down environmental policies, they didn't address lead.

Meanwhile, factories in Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania were poisoning local citizens.

Lead poisoning is serious -- there's a reason leaded gasoline is mostly gone from the market. Even now, the Times says that lead poisoning is estimated to kill more than 1.5 million people each year, most of whom live in developing countries.

The Times says Ford didn't reply to requests for comment, and it also reports that Ford executives were intrigued by Toyne's pitch, since Ford could then appeal to customers who cared about the environment.

And maybe Ford would've gone ahead had 2006 not happened. For those who don't remember, that was when the Blue Oval suffered what was, at the time, its worst financial loss ever and Bill Ford stepped down as CEO. Ford was generally seen as an advocate for the environment and sustainability.

We all know what happened next -- the Great Recession struck and the Detroit automakers needed bailout loans. Other major automakers had their own struggles.

Meanwhile, battery makers sometimes have a layer between them and the factories. These companies sometimes buy recycled lead from global trading companies who buy the lead from recyclers all over the globe.

While Ford didn't talk to the Times, one of the execs who heard Toyne's pitch did. From the NYT:

Addressing lead pollution and other environmental problems proved “financially challenging,” recalled Bernd Gottselig, a retired Ford executive who was involved in talks about Green Lead. “Several ideas would have required setting up completely new and unique supply chains,” he said.

There was another wrinkle, too. Automakers were reluctant to market ""green"" lead since it would imply, correctly, that lead was toxic.

Michael Rae, who was working on a program to certify metals and minerals in the jewelry industry at the time, sat in on a Green Lead meeting. He said it posed a public relations challenge for automakers: By touting their environmental commitment, they’d be calling attention to their reliance on a metal that has been known for centuries to be toxic.

“My recollection is that there was active resistance from the motor vehicle industry to the idea of saying ‘green lead’ because of the implication that there was ‘bad lead,’” Rae said.

Ford wasn't the only OEM that was warned. Motorcycle maker Hero Honda, which in 2007 was co-owned by Honda Motor Company, participated in an Indian pilot program for buying batteries only from battery-makers who had passed certain certifications for reducing emissions from lead.

Most major battery makers in India didn't sign up. Nor did large international automakers like Ford, GM, and what was then DaimlerChrysler.

Japanese OEM Mitsubishi also passed.

Again, from the Times:

“We are aware of lead poisoning, and understand your gist,” Eizo Tabo, the manager of environmental and recycling programs at Mitsubishi, wrote at the time. But the company said its batteries came from Japan, not India. “We do not have extra resources to be involved in the overseas project for recycling lead batteries,” Mr. Tabo wrote.

In the years that followed, lead from polluting factories has seeped further into the global supply chain. Japan, for example, has imported recycled lead from Nigeria in the past decade, trade records show.

A Mitsubishi spokesperson said it is working to eliminate lead in its products and that it has not identified serious risks of human rights violations in any of its supply chains.

Africa hasn't been the only part of the world affected by lead pollution from these factories. The Times reports that in 2011, a Mexican factory started recycling lead from old car batteries, and a ""putrid mist"" began to fall from the sky -- townspeople, including infants, got sick.

That Times piece also highlighted a research paper that suggested that as the United States came up with tighter environmental regulations, there was an increase in exports of batteries for recycling to Mexico.

A U.S. government employee, Bob Holcombe, and a group called ATSM International tried to come up with standards for recycling lead from car batteries. First, the U.S. government would need to set up a committee. A simple majority would be needed to form the committee, and anyone who attended the meeting that would decide whether a committee would be formed could vote.

The Times shows that 98 people voted, and 80 represented battery makers. Fifty came from Johnson Controls, then the world's largest maker of automotive batteries. Unsurprisingly, the vote failed.

Johnson Controls later sold its battery business, which changed brands to become Clarios. Clarios wouldn't comment on the meeting to the Times, and only said it was committed to high standards for manufacturing.

Automakers would occasionally get caught doing something unethical and/or immoral and agree to change. The companies agreed to limit the mercury trade in 2013. When child labor was found being used in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine ore for electric systems, automakers said they'd only use ethical suppliers going forward.

Now all major OEMs talk about harmful sourcing -- except for when it comes to recycled lead.

All major car companies now identify minerals and metals that are known to harm the environment and human health if they are obtained irresponsibly.

Hyundai, for example, keeps a list of minerals that are important to the “future and environment of mankind.” It requires that suppliers obtain those minerals ethically. General Motors has placed six metals under heightened scrutiny. Neither company addresses lead.

Not all companies ignore lead -- Volvo and Mitsubishi do monitor it, and Nissan claims to be phasing lead out ""where technically feasible"".

Ford said nothing about lead in its most recent sustainability report.

Toyne passed away in 2015. A business partner told the Times that Toyne had more success convincing jewelry retailers to ethically source gemstones.

Founded in 1908, it designs and manufactures cars, SUVs, trucks, and automobile parts under major brands like Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac. GM also provides financing services through GM Financial.

Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as ""large-cap stocks."" General Motors fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the automobile industry. With a global manufacturing footprint and over 160,000 employees, GM remains one of the world’s most influential vehicle makers. Today, the company is focused on expanding into electric vehicles, autonomous driving technology, and software-enabled mobility, while continuing strong performance in traditional automotive markets.

General Motors touched its ten-year high of $73.93 in the last trading session. Moreover, GM shares have surged 24.5% over the past three months, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) 5.5% surge during the same time frame.

The upward momentum continues in the long term as well. GM stock prices have gained 36.9% on a YTD basis and 21% over the past 52 weeks, outshining SPX’s 15.8% surge in 2025 and 12.9% returns over the past year.

GM stock climbed above its 50-day moving average in early May and above its 200-day moving average in early July, indicating a sustained bullish trend.

GM shares jumped 14.9% on Oct. 21 after delivering better-than-expected Q3 results. The company reported adjusted EPS of $2.80, handily beating Wall Street’s estimate of $2.28. Revenue also impressed, reaching $48.6 billion, above analysts’ projections of $44.3 billion, driven by robust vehicle demand and improved production levels.

Buoyed by the solid results, GM raised its full-year outlook and now expects adjusted EPS to fall within the range of $9.75 to $10.50. The upbeat guidance underscores management’s confidence in the company’s performance trajectory despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and competitive pressures in the automotive sector.

GM has also surpassed its competitor, Ford Motor Company’s (F) 32.9% surge in 2025 and 18.2% over the past 52 weeks.

Among the 29 analysts covering the GM stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” As of writing, GM is trading above its mean price target of $70.81.",,N,,2025-12-02 11:07:24.493903

Fresh off a decisive election win, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is promising a sharp turn in Virginia’s energy policy, vowing energy affordability for regular ratepayers, boosting in-state power generation, and forcing data centers to “pay their fair share.”

House Democrats, with their new majority, are making energy efficiency a key priority for the 2026 legislative session. They have filed bills to create an energy efficiency task force and to mandate that utilities give qualified customers efficiency upgrades. This fits nicely with local nonprofit Renew Rocktown’s launch of an Energy Check program for low-income households.

Abigail Spanberger has appointed her energy policy transition team to head up her start of an energy policy shift. The team members have lots of experience in sustainable energy.

Now that Virginia Democrats have won control of state government, they’re faced with the challenge of figuring out how to meet surging power demand from booming data centers and rural opposition to solar farms without abandoning the state’s clean energy mandate.

As Virginia’s data center boom strains the grid, a new proposal from Rewiring America shows that tech giants could free up power by footing the bill for residential energy upgrades and still come out ahead.

Dominion Energy is seeking regulatory approval of its largest slate of solar and battery storage projects yet, at nearly a dozen facilities totaling $2.9 billion.

The Washington Post, owned by the world’s largest data center operator, Jeff Bezos, recently claimed that data centers actually lower power costs. This is disingenuous! While discounted rates for big commercial power users (including data centers) have remained stable or decreased slightly in Virginia, they have risen significantly for everyone else.

The Virginia State Corporation Commission approved Dominion Energy’s controversial 944-megawatt gas peaker plant in Chesterfield along with higher electricity rates to pay for it.

Our Climate Crisis

Rising global temperatures have made Earth’s atmosphere more waterlogged, providing fuel for wetter and more dangerous storms. Some regions are more susceptible than others. In the past 85 years, the amount of water vapor moving through the atmosphere has increased 12%.

Antarctica’s Hektoria Glacier retreated five miles in two months, 10 times as fast as the previous record. This has implications for the stability of other glaciers and the pace of sea-level rise on a warming planet.

Showing some progress, the UN Paris Agreement has reduced the projected maximum global warming to less than 3°C degrees by the end of the century, which is down from prior projections of about 5°C. Even 2°C of global warming would, however, make many low-lying islands uninhabitable and swamp millions of square miles of coastal regions around the world.

Despite surging renewable energy, global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise to an all-time high this year. Increases are expected to accelerate in the U.S. and the EU but slow in China and India. At this rate the world will blow past the UN climate goal of 1.5°C of global warming in four years.

Politics and Policy

Under intense resistance from fossil fuel interests, the COP30 climate summit in Brazil fell short on drawing up a roadmap for a global transition away from oil, gas and coal. It did agree to launch limited initiatives to strengthen emissions-cutting plans, as well as tripling finance to help poor countries cope with worsening climate change impacts.

The Trump administration is arguing that abandoning fossil fuels is just too expensive and betting that the world will buy American oil and gas for decades to come. Meanwhile, China’s worldwide exports of clean energy technology have more than tripled in the last five years.

The founders of the fledgling Texas nuclear energy startup Fermi America have become billionaires because of its connections to Trump even though it has yet to produce an electron, split an atom, and has little more to show than a glossy, aspirational marketing brochure.

Nations were poised to approve the first fee on pollution from ships. The Trump administration then began threats, including tariffs, sanctions and the revocation of diplomats’ U.S. visas, which effectively killed the agreement.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemned the UN COP30 climate summit as harmful and misguided, saying, “It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives.”

This November was a very good election for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide. Voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit — and the people promising to deliver those policies.

At this year’s UN COP30 Climate Summit, the U.S. is out and Europe is struggling. Emerging countries are, however, embracing renewable energy thanks to a glut of cheap equipment from China.

More than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists were present at the COP30 climate negotiations in Brazil. This is 60% more than the delegates from the 10 most climate vulnerable countries.

The environmental group 350.org will temporarily suspend programming due to funding woes. President Trump’s threats to investigate left-leaning organizations and his rapid-fire dismantling of environmental rules have hamstrung green groups.

Gov. Josh Shapiro is pulling Pennsylvania out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, bowing to fossil fuel industry claims that it is leading to higher utility bills. Environmentalists see the decision as ‘shocking reversal’ on fighting global warming.

Parking lots in South Korea with more than 80 spaces will be required to install solar canopies. This new law doesn’t just apply to new construction — existing lots will have to comply as well.

Energy

Nuclear power is back due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, driven by big tech’s hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers. The Trump administration aims to quadruple nuclear output over the next 25 years. This does not address the exorbitant upfront costs of building nuclear plants or the old issue of safely storing radioactive waste.

So much solar power is being generated in the middle of the day in Australia that the federal government will mandate power companies to offer free electricity during those three hours. This provides an incentive to install batteries and to switch electricity use to those hours.

Hyundai still plans to invest $6 billion in a low-carbon steel plant in Louisiana despite the Trump administration’s cuts to tax credits for the green hydrogen needed to produce clean iron and a recent immigration raid on a factory the automaker is building in Georgia.

Germany is investing billions on nuclear fusion for its energy future. Critics say it’s a waste of money as the still unproven technology won’t solve near-term climate and energy problems.

Large manufacturers are increasingly participating in a demand response program in which their industrial facilities agree to power down and switch to local backup sources such as batteries during times of high demand on the grid. They, in turn, receive financial compensation from the grid operator.

People can do a lot to reduce energy use and carbon emissions in their own lives, even in the absence of government action. The recent Energy Smart Home Expo, organized by Electrify Central Ohio, demonstrated what people can do in their own households and communities.

The International Energy Agency forecasts that an oversupply of oil could create a glut of 4 million barrels a day next year. It also forecasts that renewable energy is expected to at least double globally over the next five years.

Global demand for power is growing fast, but hydro plants, the oldest source of clean energy, are struggling because of droughts, floods and other extreme weather linked to climate change.

Tapping energy from “superhot rock” could produce cheap, clean, constant geothermal energy almost anywhere — if drills and wells can survive infernal heat and pressure.

The world’s first highway that can wirelessly charge trucks and other electric vehicles as they drive has been switched on in France.

Land, Food, and Agriculture

In spite of bipartisan agreement on eliminating food waste, the U.S. still squanders roughly a third of its food supply. It’s a huge problem. Globally, if food waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

While the world continues losing huge areas of forest in the tropics, they are making a comeback in some countries including India, China, the U.S., Canada, Russia, and much of Europe. Leading in this, China has added forest the whopping size of Texas since 1990.

Climate Justice

The world’s response to the climate crisis risks deepening inequality rather than addressing it. Less than 3% of international aid to cut carbon emissions is supporting a “just transition” away from polluting industries.

What does the just energy transition mean for Africa where around 600 million people lack even basic access to electricity? Investment in the continent’s abundant sources of solar, wind and geothermal power could meet most of the continent’s energy needs.

Student and Indigenous activists clashed with UN security when they tried to force their way into the COP30 climate conference venue to protest oil drilling in the Amazon.

Pacific island countries won a landmark case at the International Court of Justice, ruling that every nation on earth has a legal obligation to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Now they want countries to act.

In a groundbreaking initiative, the Brazilian COP30 leadership included the Global Ethical Stocktake, which elevates the spiritual, ethical and cultural dimensions of the climate crisis. It organized regional dialogues of diverse voices to reflect on deeper values that should guide climate action.

Rising home insurance premiums are eating into home values in disaster-prone areas of the U.S. As insurance costs more than doubled in various areas, home values have fallen and many owners are stuck.

“Every dollar spent on the military produces over twice the greenhouse gas emissions of a dollar spent elsewhere,” writes Marijke van Duin, a member of the Dutch Mennonite Conference representing the World Council of Churches at the COP30 conference in Brazil.",https://augustafreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/earth.jpg?_t=1764638579,N,,2025-12-02 00:57:56.383895
